(Unit - Free-Text)","The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination, the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result. 
The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments since it began its analysis.  
In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program. As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff limits the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture audits would be beneficial.
The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.

AmeriCorps has drafted the language to include in the FY 2025 terms and conditions and will continue to recover monies for collectable improper payments. 

AmeriCorps had audit findings that it did not publish accurate or valid rates for ASN or FGP because it does not include differences between filed Federal Financial Reports and general ledgers as improper payments. The OIG recommends AmeriCorps reconcile the difference between grantees’ internal account records and Federal Financial Reports or to have the grantees perform the reconciliation during the payment integrity testing cycle and report unmatched errors as unknown payments. AmeriCorps does not agree that unmatched reporting errors represent improper payments as grantees have until the close of their award to reconcile its accounting records. AmeriCorps does not concur with the findings that resulted in the reported noncompliance. 

AmeriCorps also received a finding that the National Service Trust (NST) improper payment rate should have been reported in FY 2023. AmeriCorps did not concur with this recommendation, as it reperformed a susceptibility analysis in FY2023 to deem the NST susceptible, per an audit recommendation. Therefore, NST was not required to be reported until FY2024.

(Unit - Free-Text) ","The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) determined that DHS complied with 9 out of 10 Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements. The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish improper payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement to publish IP and UP estimates for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program in fiscal year (FY) 2023. 

The DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring that DHS follows the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reporting requirements for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions to resolve the OIG recommendations:
•	DHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting. 
•	DHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant program, to include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data call for publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. 

To date, DHS has completed assessment over the FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and is publishing improper payment error estimates for this 24-month disbursement period in the 2024 reporting cycle. As part of the 2024 reporting cycle requirements, DHS is providing information describing the actions that the agency has taken and/or will take to come into compliance as required per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C requirements for a first-year noncompliant program.

•	Approximately 89 percent of DHS payments had no issues noted during the review.
•	Approximately 10 percent of DHS payments were noted as having incomplete or invalid data elements (i.e., social security number, first / last name, etc.) that resulted in the payment transaction being deemed as ‘unmatchable’ to the standardized DNP datasets.

(Unit- Free-Text)","Pursuant to OMB Memorandum M-12-11 dated April 12, 2012, Reducing Improper Payments through the “Do Not Pay List,”
the Department in 2013 implemented the Department’s OMB-approved plan to perform periodic (primarily weekly) prepayment
eligibility reviews of Do Not Pay portal databases for the Department’s domestic, non-classified, non-employee- related,
non-intragovernmental disbursements. The Department currently performs prepayment checking of the following Do Not
Pay portal databases: (a) Death Master File (DMF) data from the Social Security Administration and from other sources; and
(b) the U.S. General Services Administration’s System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusion Records.

The prepayment checking performed by the Department excludes prepayment eligibility reviews of grantees under ASAP,
as Treasury performs continuous monitoring of the Do Not Pay portal of ASAP grantees. Bureau payment and acquisition
offices, as appropriate, follow up on any vendors initially matched to the Do Not Pay portal databases checked, and perform
further research as necessary to follow through and resolve any issues identified by the Do Not Pay portal matches. In most
cases, the initial matches are subsequently determined by the Department to be false matches. Other Departmental offices
are also consulted as appropriate.

Furthermore, the Department’s payment offices receive, from the Do Not Pay portal, monthly reports listing any match
results of payments made to the following databases: (a) DMF; and (b) SAM Exclusion Records. Payment offices research
and follow up on matches, as appropriate, and submit to the Do Not Pay portal monthly Adjudication Reports summarizing
the results of their efforts.

Since the inception of the payment offices’ Do Not Pay portal prepayment eligibility reviews and reviews of the Do Not Pay
portal post-payment match reports, the Department has not had any significant true matches to DMF and SAM Exclusion
Records. While the Department’s use of the Do Not Pay portal since inception has not yet identified or led to the prevention
of any significant improper payments, the Department supports the use of the Do Not Pay portal as a sound financial
management practice to identify and minimize improper payments.","2021"

"DOD","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) evaluated the compliance of the DoD’s 16 programs with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The audit for fiscal year (FY) 2023 revealed that eight Phase 1 programs successfully met the PIIA requirements. It also found that the eight Phase 2 programs were compliant with only five out of the six PIIA requirements.  On the sixth requirement, the DoD IG found the Department lacked an adequate methodology to ascertain the completeness of the DoD’s universe of transactions. Consequently, the Department was unable to publish reliable estimates.

To address this, the Department is adopting two strategic paths to achieve PIIA compliance, incorporating the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches. These phases are not necessarily sequential or obligatory. A program can achieve and maintain PIIA compliance in either phase. This is accomplished by implementing corrective actions aimed at reducing both improper payments and unknown payments. The goal is to bring these payment rates below the PIIA statutory threshold or to a tolerable level.

Path 1: Risk Assessments for PIIA Compliance (Phase 1)

This path involves conducting comprehensive risk assessments on unique data characteristics and subpopulation groups. These groups are not expected to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments due to their internal controls designed to mitigate risk. In FY 2024, we restructured the department’s entire Payment Integrity portfolio based on the results and recommendations from the DoD OIG’s previous audits and interagency lessons learned.

Path 2: Sampling & Estimation for PIIA Compliance (Phase 2)

This path targets programs anticipated to exceed the OMB statutory threshold and likely to have significant improper and unknown payments. In FY 2023, the DoD OIG found that the Department produced unreliable improper payment and unknown payment estimates for the 13th consecutive year. Despite having statistically valid sampling plans, the Phase 2 programs failed due to the unsubstantiated payment population used to create the test samples.

To rectify these deficiencies, the Department will establish a Payment Integrity Universe of Transactions (UoT) working group. This group aims to report reliable estimates by the FY 2025 reporting cycle, which will include a complete and reconciled payment population along with the previous valid sampling methodology. The working group’s goal is to develop and implement a standardized process to identify each program’s UoT population data characteristics, validate the completeness of the UoT payment population, and produce reliable improper and unknown payment estimates.

(Unit- Free-Text)","Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) Commercial Pay Operations sends a weekly file under the “Batch” process which contains invoices in a pre-payment status.  Results are available and researched the next day in the Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal.  
During FY21, 9.6M invoices amounting to 1.8B were submitted to DNP.  Since the submission is on a weekly basis in the pre-payment environment, some invoices are sent multiple times with no guarantee of actual payment.   Of the matched transactions, 8% are considered true positives, which means the DNP system correctly identified an issue with the vendor.  However, the vendor falls under the established Business Rule which states, if the vendor performed in accordance with their contract they are owed the funds.  Additional reasons that may apply include a vendor may not be required to be registered in SAM based on existing FAR Clauses in their contract.  Of the matched transactions, 92% are false positives with 98% of the false positives related to Death Master Data where a deceased person’s SSN matches a Company’s TIN in error.  
In addition to the Batch process, Commercial Pay Treasury Disbursed (TDD) payments are ran through the DNP Death Master databases.  This process has not reduced or prevented any improper payments.  Transactions are researched to determine whether they are a false positive or if collection action must be initiated with adjudication in the portal after research.  

For Military Health Benefits the Defense Health Agency Contract Resource Management (DHA-CRM) individual Payments: DHA-CRM processes relatively few (5–55) case recoupment small ($5–$40,000) refunds each month.  The Single Online Search (SOS) service is utilized, prepayment, for 100% of all case recoupment refunds to verify a payee not been placed on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) and to verify an individual has not passed away. Any matches will be referred to the DHA Office of General Counsel for adjudication.  
Vendor, Contract Payments: CRM processes approximately 191 routine payments per month for 13 unique TRICARE private sector care (PSC) payees. The SOS service is utilized, prepayment, once a month to verify a PSC payee has not been placed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) or the LEIE. The initial DNP Portal (DNP) check is then carried for all remaining payments being made to that unique payee for the rest of the month.  This process is then repeated every month, maintaining 100% validation in the DNP. Any matches are validated with the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), ensuring the contractor does not have the same EIN as a person’s SSN.  If the contractor is on the SAM, LEIE, and/or TOP list, the finding is referred to the assigned Contracting Officer.  For proprietary reasons, the contractor is responsible for resolving these matching issues. 
The risk for payments disbursed via the PSC contractor lies outside of CRM’s control. Contractors are not required to utilize the DNP at the pre-payment phase to comply with PIIA.

In FY 2021, two matches for individual payments were deemed improper for the total amount of $1,063, and action has been taken to rectify further payments to these two individuals. All other matches received by DOI have been adjudicated and deemed proper. The Department of the Interior (DOI) will continue to add DNP databases for Department payment files to be run against to identify improper payments. The additional databases have assisted DOI in identifying improper payments that should not have been made. DOI will continue to register for new DNP databases that are offered to the Federal government to lower the improper payment rate.

State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.

States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper payments. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.

ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13);

As described in the Executive Summary above, FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program is expired in law and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report  and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment integrity reporting is possible. The amount of FY24 PUA outlays is $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is not applicable to negative outlays.

The DNP Business Center provides Federal agencies with a web-based single-entry access DNP Portal to these databases & payment data analytics services. DOL agencies implement the DNP Initiative as appropriate for their payment integrity needs.
DNP Working Solution Payment Reviews: The DNP Portal compares the Department’s PAM file of all Treasury disbursed payments against the DMF database. When a payment matches, the payment information is returned to OCFO or responsible agency payment office for adjudication. Matches are reviewed against business rules to cull false-positives. Matches which cannot be culled per business rules are reviewed by agency subject matter experts to determine if the match represents a true positive IP.
DOL Program Reviews of DNP List & non-DNP List Databases: DOL maintains comprehensive, cost effective internal controls to ensure the payment integrity of all programs. Among these controls, programs review private & government-owned databases directly, as appropriate for their business needs. Procurement & grants programs include internal controls requiring review of all vendors against the SAM database. OWCP benefit programs conduct batch matching against the DMF prior to Treasury disbursal. These reviews are designed to prevent IP & vary significantly by specific programmatic need

The Treasury analyzes each agency’s payments and provides a monthly report itemizing any payments that were made to potentially ineligible recipients. These potential matches are identified when the name of an agency’s payee matches the name of an individual or entity listed in federal data sources contained in the Treasury’s DNP working system. 

In FY 2023, the Treasury screened the EPA payments through the following DNP data sources on a post- payment basis: the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and the General Services Administration’s System for Award Management Exclusion List. During FY 2023 a total of 226,737 EPA payments worth $3.76 billion of the EPA payments were screened, and no improper payments were identified.

Over the last several years the FCC has made numerous improvements in its programs to reduce improper payments.  This is reflected in the number of phase 2 programs the FCC has at this time.  A couple of years ago the FCC had four programs in phase 2 but next year we will only have two.","2024"
"FCC","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","The FCC had two program that were not compliant for the most recent reporting period.  Those programs were the USF-Lifeline program which is in phase 2 since it does not meet the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million in outlays.  The other program that was not in compliance in the Affordable Connectivity program (ACP) which is currently in phase 1 reporting requirements.  
USF-Lifeline - The Commission did not concur with the non-compliance finding for the Lifeline program. The auditors’ recognized that no further action is required going forward. However, we respectfully disagreed with the reasoning and conclusions that were reached. The auditors based their finding on dated inputs (namely, an initial response that gave a preliminary estimate done by our Administrator of what might be a “potential” overpayment). In addition, the auditors appeared to consistently disregarded subsequent written responses by the agency itself indicating that the Commission had determined that the “potential” overpayment estimate the auditors were relying on was vastly overstated. The consequence of the auditor’s approach was to require the agency to report a substantial amount as improper which the agency had repeatedly determined (as a regulatory matter) was not in fact improper, undermining the accuracy of improper payment reporting.
As the FCC previously explained at length, this matter involved an unusual regulatory wrinkle. The Commission had been considering a pending request from an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) for a correction to the appendix to the June 13, 2012 order granting it an ETC designation. The consideration of that request was an exercise of the Commission’s regulatory authority, and a decision on the application had to be made before a determination was made regarding whether any payments were improper. The basic substance of that decision was made in 2020—namely that the particular circumstances justified a nunc pro tunc grant of authorization that would substantially reduce or eliminate any overpayment—and was communicated to the auditors. Ultimately, on May 7, 2024, the agency issued an order granting the request nunc pro tunc to June 13, 2012, the date of the original grant. The effect of the order corrected the clerical filing error made by the ETC and was retroactive to the date the original order and was issued. Moreover, because the order was effective to the date of the original June 2012 order, the ETC provision of service in the relevant areas has giving rise to the audit finding was authorized. Thus there were no improper payments and there was never a need to report such. Per the auditors, on May 7, 2024, the FCC issued two Orders and a related Consent Decree regarding this matter. The Orders and Consent Decree had the effect of retroactively expanding the ETC’s jurisdiction to the full area for which they had been operating. Therefore, the Orders had the effect of retroactively making the balance of payments valid.
ACP - The FCC underreported improper payment amounts of $6 million in its FY23 data that was published on paymentaccuracy.gov. The recommendation by the auditors was to develop and implement policies and procedures to identify, quantify, and report any downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from provider non-compliant conduct on paymentaccuracy.gov. Corrective actions will include: 1) Every month, our Administrator will compile and report to the Office of the Managing Director all ACP and EBB downward revisions received the prior month that fall outside of the administrative filing window and 2) Develop an ACP procedure to identify and report downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from non-compliant conduct.

It's not unusual for companies to dissolve their LLCs after a building sale or transfer, making recovery of funds difficult.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord pays the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the GSA annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid through rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are less than the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.  Recoveries arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios by not sending GSA the appropriate tax bills.    

Resolution 1: GSA has established agencywide procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord does not send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper payments in this area in the last 4 years.

Condition 2: There are several variables that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker commission credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on a preceding lease, etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered in the billing system (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system to the payment system (Pegasys).

Resolution 2: Checklists have been developed in GSA's Regions to ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system (REXUS).  Also, in July of 2020, the REXUS to Pegasys interface automatically transfers data from REXUS to Pegasys so that it is no longer a manual process of entering credit data for leases into Pegasys which has helped reduce errors.","2024"

"HHS","ara2_1","[ara2_1]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences explaining the methods used by the agency to recover Improper Payments identified in recovery AUDITS. (Unit- Free-Text)","The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified in recovery audits across various programs:

Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments by issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the identified amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from future payments made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily submit a refund to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper payment.

Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations, the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits in FY 2024.

Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an analysis of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare Part D coverage. Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors are notified of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation is provided.

Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of Medicaid overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.

Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt's existence and including claim-specific information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury for collection.

These methods demonstrate a systematic approach to recovering improper payments in various healthcare programs, ensuring that funds are appropriately recovered while providing avenues for resolution and reconciliation where necessary.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","For APTC, consumers must reconcile advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) at the time of tax filing, thereby mitigating overpayment of APTC. Furthermore, the use of data matching programs with other Federal agencies throughout the eligibility determination process significantly reduces the risk of fraud and abuse by applicants or third parties by requiring that personal information provided on an application match known data. As such, CMS has determined that there is no justification to conduct recovery audits for the APTC program at this time.

For Head Start Disaster Relief, the error rate for this time limited program is less than 1%.  For identified improper payments attributable to recipient actions, recipients may receive heightened training and technical assistance and/or consequences such as limitations on the availability of funds, disallowances, or future offset of funds in the event that improper payments are identified.

For CCDF, HHS regulations require States to have processes in place to support accountability and sound financial management of federal child care funds. States must undergo annual audits. Any amounts determined through an audit not to have been spent according to CCDF statutory or regulatory provisions, or the approved State Plan, must be repaid to the Federal government. Regardless of whether the state is able to recover the funds, improperly spent funds are already subject to disallowance. Further, CCDF regulations require States to recover child care payments that are the result of fraud. These payments are to be recovered from the party responsible for committing the fraud. HHS believes that these efforts are more efficient and effective than conducting recovery audits, given the nature of the program and other recovery methods in place.

For all other ACF programs, ACF promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities.  Recovery of improper payments would potentially harm the communities served by ACF's programs.  Also, for many of the programs recovering funds from states, organizations, and individuals that provide these services may reduce the ability to support the needs of vulnerable, underserved, and low-income beneficiaries of these services.","2022"
"HHS","ara2_3","[ara2_3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences presenting the justification for the determination that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery AUDITS in certain programs. (Unit - Free-Text)","The decision not to conduct recovery audits in the Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit (APTC) program is justified based on several key factors. First, the requirement for consumers to reconcile APTC payments at the time of tax filing inherently mitigates the risk of overpayment. This means that any discrepancies or overpayments can be rectified during the annual tax return process, reducing the need for recovery audits to recoup funds.

Second, the utilization of data matching programs with various Federal agencies during the eligibility determination process significantly enhances the accuracy and integrity of the application process. These data matching procedures ensure that the personal information provided by applicants aligns with known data, reducing the potential for fraud or abuse.

Considering these factors, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has found that the combination of the reconciliation process and robust data matching practices effectively minimizes the risk of improper payments and fraud, making it unnecessary to allocate resources for recovery audits in the APTC program at this time. This decision is both fiscally responsible and practical, ensuring that resources are directed towards areas where they are needed most.

The Administration for Children & Families (ACF) is a division of the Department of Health & Human Services.  ACF promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities.  ACF programs aim to empower families and individuals to increase their economic independence and productivity; encourage strong, healthy, supportive communities that have a positive impact on quality of life and the development of children; create partnerships with front-line service providers, states, localities and tribal communities to identify and implement solutions that transcend traditional program boundaries; improve access to services through planning, reform and integration; and address the needs, strengths and abilities of vulnerable populations including refugees and migrants.   Recovery of improper payments would potentially harm the communities served by ACF's programs.  Also, for many of the programs recovering funds from states, organizations, and individuals that provide these services may reduce the ability to support the needs of vulnerable, underserved, and low-income beneficiaries of these services","2023"

For the Administration for Children & Families (ACF), recovery efforts could negatively impact vulnerable communities by reducing the resources available to support underserved, low-income beneficiaries. In programs like the Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC), existing processes such as tax filing reconciliations and data matching with federal agencies (e.g., IRS, DHS) already mitigate the risk of improper payments, making additional audits unnecessary. For Medicaid and CHIP, states run the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) programs, and the decision to conduct recovery audits is determined at the state level, considering cost-effectiveness. In these cases, the potential harm to program beneficiaries or the administrative burden outweighs the benefits of additional recovery efforts.","2024"

(Unit - Free-Text)","Various conditions give rise to overpayments identified in recovery audits in different healthcare programs:

Medicare FFS: Overpayments are often detected in Medicare Fee-For-Service when data analysis and medical record reviews reveal inaccuracies in billed and paid claims. These claims are selected for audit based on prior-year improper payment rate data, indicating discrepancies in billing and payment accuracy.

Medicare Part D: Overpayments in Part D audits stem from a lack of documentation by plan sponsors when making payment determinations. To address this issue, CMS has taken steps to provide training to plan sponsors and share lessons learned from audits to promote best practices among plan sponsors.

Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP): Overpayments occur when Medicare's information about a beneficiary's additional insurance coverage is missing, incomplete, or inaccurate, leading Medicare to mistakenly or conditionally pay for services as the primary payer. The Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor, operating as the Commercial Repayment Center, identifies and recovers these payments from the entity with primary payment responsibility. The MSP program aims to ensure that Medicare is aware of situations where it should not be the primary payer, and it follows Coordination of Benefits rules to determine the order of payment between Medicare and other insurers.

In each of these scenarios, the conditions giving rise to overpayments are being addressed through audits, training, documentation improvements, and enhanced coordination efforts to prevent and rectify improper payments and discrepancies in the healthcare payment system. These measures contribute to the overall integrity of healthcare programs and the responsible use of public funds.","2023"

1. CHIP's Improper Payment Rate Exceeding 10%: The OIG recommended implementing more robust corrective action plans and providing technical assistance to states. HHS worked with states to create corrective action plans, combined with state flexibilities during the pandemic, resulting in CHIP's improper payment rate dropping below 10%. HHS will continue to monitor compliance and work with states to address any emerging issues.

2. Lack of Improper Payment Estimates for Risk-Susceptible Programs: The OIG advised that all programs identified as risk-susceptible should report improper payment estimates. HHS has begun addressing this by resuming measurement and reporting for the Foster Care program and launching the Improper Payment Pre-testing and Assessment program for State-based Exchanges. These efforts aim to establish more accurate and consistent reporting across all risk-susceptible programs.

3. Limited Progress in Medicare Part C Payment Integrity: To improve payment integrity for Medicare Part C, the OIG recommended accelerating corrective actions and recovery audits. HHS responded by recovering overpayments from Medicare Part C's Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits, starting with payment year 2018. HHS plans to continue enhancing audit processes and refine corrective actions for future recovery efforts.

4. Incomplete Risk Assessments for Programs with Outlays Over $10 Million: The OIG stressed the importance of conducting risk assessments for all such programs at least once every three years. In FY 2024, HHS significantly increased the number of programs assessed and plans to review all programs for significant improper payments by FY 2025, ensuring compliance with the three-year requirement.

5. Delays in Medicare Part C Recovery Audits: The OIG recommended expediting the audit process for timely identification and recovery of improper payments. HHS has taken steps to finalize past RADV audits and will implement a more structured timeline for future audits to prevent delays.

6. Methodology Issues in COVID-19 Uninsured Program Estimate: The OIG suggested refining the sampling and estimation methods to better capture program characteristics. HHS completed reporting for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program, providing a combined rate for the past two years of payments.

"HHS","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","HHS uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to review payment eligibility for purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments. HHS utilizes the Treasury Working System to screen payments against the Do Not Pay death record databases. On a quarterly basis, HHS reviews Do Not Pay portal payment matches for items in need of adjudication. Flagged payments or payments listed as possible matches are reviewed with the respective HHS division making the payment before a determination is reported to Treasury on the portal. 

In FY 2023, the Department screened 1.1 million payments worth $723.9 billion against the Do Not Pay portal's death record databases. While 12 potential improper payments were initially identified, further investigation by HHS confirmed zero improper payments in FY 2023.  Additionally, CMS conducted checks on 1.1 billion payments, totaling $415.8 billion in FY 2023, against PIIA-listed databases outside of the DNP portal. Through these checks, CMS prevented 564,185 payments, resulting in savings of $2.2 billion.

HHS’s Do Not Pay Initiative implementation has proven that HHS has robust and effective internal controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal funds.","2023"

"HHS","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","In June 2010, the President issued a Memorandum on Enhancing Payment Accuracy Through a “Do Not Pay List” where agencies can access and analyze relevant information before determining eligibility for funding. Since 2010, HHS worked diligently to implement the DNP initiative. Several of HHS’s OpDivs are using DNP to check for recipients’ or potential recipients’ eligibility for payment and to prevent improper payments. Further, U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury)-disbursed payments are matched against the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Death Master File (DMF); The Department of Defense Death Records; Department of State Death Records; and American InfoSource Death Data, a commercial data source that sources information from funeral homes, newspapers, and county probate records, in the DNP portal daily to identify improper payments. In FY 2021, the Department screened 1 million payments against PIIA-listed death databases, representing $653.9 billion. While the Department identified 32 potential improper payments over the past year through these daily matches, upon further investigation, HHS confirmed 0 payments as improper in FY 2021. Lastly, CMS also checks certain payments against PIIA-listed databases outside of the DNP portal. In FY 2021, CMS screened 1.1 billion payments against PIIA-listed databases, representing $411 billion in payments. Through these checks, CMS stopped 396,285 payments, representing a savings of $2.5 billion. HHS was one of the first agencies to establish a Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) with Treasury in FY 2014 and has been utilizing these data sources successfully since then to verify eligibility and stop improper payments.","2021"

The CPD Community Development Block Grant – DRAA-Sandy program monitors disaster recovery activities for Federally declared disaster arepas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The grantee submits a quarterly performance report using the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system that is reviewed by CPD field offices or HUD headquarters. The performance reports are used to review the grant expenditures and accomplishments for all CDBG-DR funded activities. The grantee also uses the DRGR system to submit vouchers and drawdown funds. After a voucher is created and submitted by a grantee Drawdown Requester, the voucher line items must be reviewed and approved by the grantee Drawdown Approver. If a line item is approved, it is either sent to the Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) for processing, or, if the grant drawdown threshold of $5 million has been reached, it is sent to HUD for review and approval before it can be submitted to LOCCS. CPD also monitors the grantee’s efforts to prevent the duplication of benefits and ensure programmatic compliance. 
CPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement, and equipment. The exhibits located in Chapter 6 of the CPD Monitoring Handbook, serve the purpose of capturing improper payments identified in the program file-level reviews during on-site or remote monitoring. If any improper payments are identified the reviewer must indicate on the monitoring exhibit the program area, amount, type of improper payment and the corrective action. The grantee is notified of any improper payments identified during the monitoring review at the exit conference. If the grantee is unable to provide documentation to resolve the improper payment, a finding will be issued in the Monitoring Report which is transmitted to the grantee within 90 days of the monitoring review. In most cases, CPD recaptures overpayments by offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD typically instructs the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal sources to their grant’s line of credit in LOCCS, or to Treasury’s account if the grant has closed or the funding availability period has expired. Additionally, CPD may also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
Additionally, HUD monitors all high-risk grantees annually and, in some instances, bi-annually. Although these monitoring engagements do not exclusively include a review of improper payments, the reviewers are able to identify improper payments during the file review. If a grantee must repay HUD, CPD will coordinate with the applicable offices depending on the amount being repaid. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury Financial Communications System (TFCS).

The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. 
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the POI 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the Payroll, Benefits, and Retirement Division’s (PBRD) quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated.
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g. Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC).
OCFO-Budget provides assistance to program budget offices by flagging payroll corrections or unusual payroll activity as part of a bi-weekly payroll projection process. OCFO-Budget also works with program offices and ARC to correct these issues.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

(Lead Hazard Reduction – OLHCHH)

During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The risks of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation.

The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, 
which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2022"

The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

MultiFamily Notes
The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. Each note is serviced in accordance with the mortgage and mortgage note documents. Servicing activities include billing, collections, disbursements, escrow management, and processing of terminations. Servicing activities are performed daily until termination of the note from the system. 
Taxes and R4R escrows are incorporated into the note and managed by the note. Amounts collected are all pre-determined by the language within the note itself. Payment amounts (R4R costs, insurance, taxes and miscellaneous A/P) are calculated based on invoices submitted. 
All disbursements are initially processed by the contractor. However, the Multifamily Notes Servicing Branch (MFNSB) staff have final approval on all disbursements. No disbursements are made by the contractor without approval from the MFNSB. Disbursements are approved by HUD. 
Each payment request has an invoice and physical approval. Separation of duties is maintained for the disbursement process. Contract staff create the transmittal to allow the disbursement; a second contract staff approves the transmittal; a third contract staff creates the disbursement. None of the staff have the authority to perform any other duty in the payment process. Upon receipt of the disbursement request from the contractor, it is reviewed by MFNSB staff to ensure the requested disbursement is correct and in compliance with HUD guidelines. Employees conduct data matching analytics to verify key information for disbursements such as project name, address, FHA number, iREMS number, and dollar amount. For payment schedules the Tax ID Number, Routing Number, Deposit Account Number, and Dollar Amount are validated against supporting documentation to ensure accuracy. 
Once the disbursements are reviewed and approved by MFNSB, they are sent to the Cash Management Branch (CMB) for certification and processing. Payments are disbursed directly to the vendor responsible for collecting the disbursement and applying the funds to the expense. Contract staff perform daily banking functions to ensure all checks have been cashed and ACH transactions processed. 
Once the Certifying Officer in CMB certifies the schedule for payment, CMB sends the Secure Payment System (SPS) Report via email to the MFNSB. Staff compares the schedule payment package to the daily SPS Report and to the Goal Report Agency Location Codes (ALC) Payment Details to ensure the payment information is correct. In addition, all cash activities are reconciled through monthly accounting reconciliations. These payments are also post payment checked 
On a monthly basis, the MFNSB Chief conducts random sampling of payment schedules. A sampling of 20% of paid schedules is selected and reviewed for accuracy of information and payment. There have been no inaccuracies or overpayments cited. In the event of an overpayment of taxes or hazard insurance, the contractor will work with the tax authority or insurance provider to recoup the overpayment. If the contractor is unable to recover the funds they will escalate the issue to MFNSB, which will work with the account executive, the Office of General Counsel, and the program area to ensure the overpayment is recaptured. In the event of an overpayment of R4R, the contractor will work with the management agent to recoup the overpayment. If the management agent fails to return the overpayment within 30 days, MFNSB will notify the account executive and program area. The overpayment will be included in the next scheduled billing statement and the management agent will be issued a formal notification of the action.

Federal Housing Administration
The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The FOC is responsible for managing the business operations for the Title I loan program, which includes registering and endorsing loans for insurance, billing and collecting premiums, and examining claims for loss and approving them for payment. The FOC is also responsible for performing the debt collection and servicing activities for Title I Notes (defaulted Title I loans) and generic debts (other FHA debts).
The Title I program authorizes HUD to insure lenders against default on loans used to finance property improvements and to purchase manufactured homes. Lenders are required to pay premiums covering the insurance of their loans and submit applications for insurance benefits for defaulted loans. HUD is required to collect the unpaid loan balance, including eligible expenses, from the defaulted borrower.
The FOC’s Title I Insurance Processing Branch (TIIPB) is responsible for evaluating and approving lender applications for insurance benefits. The lender’s application must include loan information and any documentation necessary for the TIIPB to calculate a claim payment. There are three types of claim: initial, resubmitted, and supplemental. An initial claim is a first submission. A resubmitted claim is one that the TIIPB had previously denied. A supplemental claim is an additional claim for the same loan when the lender finds documentation for expenses not included in the initial claim. TIIPB support staff establish the claim in the Title I Insurance and Claims System (TIIS/F72). The process includes assigning a claim number, entering the date the claim was received, and assigning the claim to a TIIPB examiner. The examiner conducts a full review of the claim to determine whether the loan complies with Title I underwriting and servicing requirements and whether expenses claimed by the lender are supported by the documentation provided. If these conditions are satisfied, the examiner processes the claim calculation and authorization for payment in TIIS/F72. TIIS/F72 processes the payments authorized on the same day in a single batch file, sends the file to Treasury’s Payment Application Modernization system, and sends another file to the Cash Management Branch to authorize the Treasury disbursement. TIIS/F72 sends a file of paid claims to the Debt Collection and Management System – Title I (DCAMS-TI/F71), which converts the paid claims to notes receivable. The FOC’s Asset Recovery Division (ARD) is responsible for pursuing collection against the debtor (defaulted borrower).
The TIIPB conducts quality reviews of paid Title I claims to ensure consistent processing and examination quality. Each month, the TIIPB Branch Chief randomly selects 10% of paid claims for review. The Branch Chief either reviews the claim themselves or assigns them to examiners for a peer review. The reviewer conducts a full examination of the claim and reports whether the claim payment was conforming (compliant/no deficiencies), deficient (minor issues to address), unacceptable (serious issues to address), or mitigated (issues found but readily resolved). The outcomes of quality reviews are documented in both the Case Notes screen of TIIS/F72 and in the Title I Quality Reviews folder of the FOC’s SharePoint site.
If the review identified a deficiency that resulted in an overpaid claim, the TIIPB Branch Chief or examiner will issue a request to the lender for a full (for an unacceptable claim) or partial (for a deficient claim) repurchase of the loan. The request instructs the lender to repurchase the loan by remitting payment to a designated lockbox within 30 days or to ask for a reconsideration of the repurchase request within 10 days. If the lender fails to submit documentation that satisfactorily resolves the deficiency or to remit payment within the established timeframes, TIIPB issues a repurchase demand which gives the lender 30 days to remit the repurchase funds and informs the lender of the actions HUD will take if the funds aren’t remitted, including transferring the unpaid repurchase to the FOC’s ARD for delinquent debt collection, which includes referral to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for administrative offset.
Both paid and unpaid repurchase requests and demands involve coordination between the FOC’s TIIPB and ARD. The ARD ensures that the Title I Note receivable is reclassified as a full or partial repurchase. Payments for full and partial repurchases are sent to the Title I Notes lockbox which transmits a collection file to DCAMS-TI/F71 to credit the funds to the Title I Note receivable associated with the claim. The ARD notifies the TIIPB when repurchase funds are received and the TIIPB updates the claim record in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04). For full repurchases, the ARD closes the Title I Note receivable as repurchased. Before closing out the receivable, the ARD will issue the debtor (defaulted Title I borrower) a refund for any non-repurchase collections received. The TIIPB returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I promissory note and lien, if applicable.
Unpaid full or partial repurchase requests and demands are transferred to the ARD for delinquent debt collection. The ARD establishes a Title I Repurchase receivable in the Debt Collection and Asset Management System – Generic Debt (DCAMS-GD/F71A), which initiates the collection process by issuing an automated demand letter describing the debt and instructing the lender to remit payment in full within 30 days or contact the designated ARD Debt Servicing Representative (DSR) to request a plan to repay the debt in installments. If the lender does not pay the debt in full or enter a repayment plan within 30 days, DCAMS-GD/F71A issues a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Collect by Administrative Offset. The NOI notifies the lender that HUD intends to refer the debt to the TOP, describes the TOP process for administrative offset of federal payments, and provides the lender with steps to take to contest the basis of the debt or the amount demanded by filing an appeal with HUD’s Board of Appeals (BOA) within 65 days. If the lender files an appeal, DCAMS-GD/F71A suspends referral to TOP pending a decision and order from the BOA administrative law judge. (BOA adjudicates appeals by gathering and evaluating statements and documents from both parties.) If the BOA judge issues a decision and order declaring the debt unenforceable, the ARD closes the debt as unenforceable and notifies the TIIPB. The TIIPB will reverse the pending repurchase in TIIS/F72. If the decision and order results in a dismissal of the lender’s appeal, the DSR updates debt status in DCAMS-GD/F71A making the debt eligible for referral to TOP. DCAMS-GD/F71A refers eligible debts that are 121 or more days delinquent to TOP and the Treasury Cross-Servicing Program. DCAMS-GD/F71A also reports lenders to commercial credit reporting agencies (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax).
The TIIPB may, rather than transfer the unpaid repurchase to the ARD for delinquent debt collection, pursue internal offset of payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. In most cases, however, it’s more effective to transfer the debt to the ARD, since any federal payment made to the lender, including Title I claim payments, will be collected through TOP.
Collections, both voluntary and involuntary, received on a Title Repurchase debt are credited to the account. When a debt is paid in full, the ARD makes entries in DCAMS-GD/F71A to close out the debt as paid in full and to close out the Title I Note receivable as unenforceable. The TIIPB makes entries in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04) to acknowledge satisfaction of the repurchase demand and returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I Promissory Note and lien, if applicable.
 If the ARD concludes that the Title I Repurchase debt is uncollectible, it takes steps to close out the debt in DCAMS-GD/F71A, which will issue an IRS Form 1099-C to the lender and report the debt accordingly to the IRS. The TIIPB will pursue secondary recovery activities on the uncollectible repurchase by internally offsetting future claims payments to the lender or blocking payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. The TIIPB may also refer the lender to FHA’s Mortgagee Review Board for sanctions
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the TOP and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender, which is usually resolved within 30 days of final settlement. The mortgagee either returns the overpaid funds or files a supplemental claim. If the overpayment is not resolved within the 30-day or 60-day period after final settlement, the reviewer sends a follow-up letter at the end of each period advising the mortgagee of the penalties and interest assessed. If still not resolved after 90 days, the overpayment is electronically transferred to HUD’s FOC in Albany, New York for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.

The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. 
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated.
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g., Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s OCPO HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.

Lead Hazard Reduction
During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the OLHCHH reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the GTR or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal.

A payment recapture audit was deemed not be cost-beneficial based on the nature of these programs. Collectability is a concern as tenants may no longer be receiving housing assistance when the overpayments are identified, or many may not be able to repay the subsidy with their own resources. HSNG Owners/ PIH PHAs use the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information and reduce administrative and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative guidance. The program Points of Contact (POC) use EIV to monitor the owner’s compliance with access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored locally at each Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered by PHAs nationwide. A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in addition to staff time. There are also no centralized computer database capturing documents used to support the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

II. Lack of Empirical Evidence
Choice Neighborhoods Initiative
Family Self-Sufficiency Program
Public Housing Capital Fund
Public Housing Operating Fund
Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing (HOPE VI)

The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessments identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence, either through risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring reviews, that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs and activities, and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment recapture audits of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

III. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Programs

Community Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria)
Community Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Louisiana, Texas, West Virginia, Hurricane IKE, Other Disasters)
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
Project Based Section 8 - Renewal of Expiring Sec. 8 Mod Rehab SRO
Self-Help Homeowner Opportunity Program (SHOP)
Community Project Funding - Community Project/Congressional Funding

The CPD funds have a monitoring process in place to assess the quality of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about program participants that is critical for making informed judgments about program effectiveness and management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances of fraud, waste, and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts, written communications, analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings. Monitoring also provides opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments as well as successful management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might be replicated by other CPD program participants. 
Parties involved include Special Need Assistance Programs (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and Coordination (OPDC), Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED), Office of General Counsel (OGC), Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1a, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements of Subparts D and F of 2 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures are reviewed to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines whether the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will recapture overpayments by offsetting future draws. Overpayments in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program are addressed through reduction of future allocations as opposed to future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD will typically instruct the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal funds sources to their grant’s line of credit in Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) or to the Treasury’s account if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO Box 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System (TFCS). CPD programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
In addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

IV. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs
2500-Contractor Payments
3300-Master Sub-Servicer (MSS) Default Activity

For any overpayments identified, Ginnie Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments to the contractor. However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie Mae will request reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments made to the General Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor, Ginnie Mae will process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments is greater than the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions than mitigating strategies as outlined already. 
As it relates to the Pass-Through Assistance Program (PTAP) program, which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper payments includes validation of the request against the loan and pool information submitted to the Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers equity and liquidity as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the custodial account balance from which the Investor payments will be drawn.
The PTAP disbursement process is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests. The PTAP disbursement request is processed for review and approval for payment. All payment requests are approved by an Independent Certifying Officer (ICO) (who accepts personal financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper payments they certify). The cost of recovering improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the program.

V. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance Programs
Project-Based Rental Assistance Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Rental Housing Assistance Program – Section 236

The results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs are mandated by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s EIV system. EIV is a web-based application which provides owners with employment, wage, unemployment compensation and social security benefit information for tenants participating in HUD’s assisted housing programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is a system developed to improve the fiscal control over assisted housing programs and acts as the sole repository of all tenant certification data, assistance contract data and crucial payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS and a variance of $2,400 per year generates an error and owners are required to follow-up with the tenant and resolve the error. If an overpayment is identified, tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum or by entering into a repayment agreement. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.

Of the thirty-eight (38) programs excluded from a Payment Recapture Audit, the remaining twenty (20) programs have other mechanisms in place to recover overpayments.

(Unit - Free-Text)","For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA.  The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims.  A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, 
which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2).  The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS).  BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s).  If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.

If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).

Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2023"
"HUD","arp17","[arp17]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the conditions giving rise to Overpayments identified in recovery AUDITS and how those conditions are being resolved. (Unit - Free-Text)","In March 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented an automated payment system for claiming Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance benefits.  This is an on-line database management system with control exercised primarily on an exception basis. The system was designed to speed the payment of mortgagees’ claims, reduce paperwork burdens, enhance the level of control, and improve service.  The integrity of this automated claims processing system is dependent on mortgagee compliance with HUD’s claim processing requirements.  Expenses are reported by category on the claim form and must be supported by a complete claim file maintained by the mortgagee.  Mortgagees are not required to furnish receipts for reimbursable expenses at the time insurance benefits are claimed.  Therefore at the time the claims are paid to the mortgagee, they would not have provided documentation to support all of the amounts and expenses claimed, as the amounts may have been automatically processed.  After the claims have been paid to the mortgagee, a post claim review will be conducted to audit the servicer's portfolio to determine if any amounts are inappropriate, unsupported, or overpaid, and therefore is recovered in a post claim review.

2022-FO-0005 2A - Develop and implement a plan that ensures the continuity of adequate internal controls over the PIH-TBRA program to detect and prevent improper payments, which can be implemented in a virtual environment. This plan should include how HUD can review tenant files or other information that validates tenant data remotely without compromising PII. 

2023-FO-0009 1A - Establish an improper payment council within HUD that consists of senior accountable officials from across the Department with a role in the effort that would work to identify risks and challenges to compliance and identify solutions as a collaborative group. This is a priority open recommendation. A final action target date has not been established for this recommendation because OCFO has not provided an acceptable proposed management decision*.

2024-IG-0001 - Develop and execute a detailed plan and timeline for both testing and reporting estimates of improper payments in the PIH-TBRA and PBRA programs in compliance with Federal law and OMB guidance.

However, due to the expiration of HUD's Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) with the Treasury in 2019, the agency has been unable to fully utilize DNP. This lapse has resulted in payments to entities with inactive or unregistered System for Award Management (SAM) statuses, indicating that the DNP Initiative has not been utilized consistently across HUD programs. Consequently, there has been an increase in the risk of improper payments, suggesting that the DNP Initiative, while potentially effective in reducing improper payments, has not been fully leveraged by the agency, thus failing to reduce improper payments as intended.

(Unit - Free-Text) ","In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements (3, 4, 5b and 6).    

The OIG determination was based upon the FEHB Program not reporting an Improper Payment Estimate in FY 2023. The OIG recommended OPM issue an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefit program that will allow OPM to be in compliance with PIIA reporting requirements in future reporting years. 

OPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans. Off-cycle risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper and unknown payment estimate.

OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants. OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025.","2024"

Due to the dollar value, payment volume, program complexity, and nature of pension payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including death match and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established procedures to recapture overpayments through recovery payments, installment repayment agreements, offsets against other continuing benefits to recoup amounts owed by the participant, or referrals to the Department of Treasury’s Centralized Receivables Service. In some cases, recapture of payments may not be sought based on demonstration that a participant is experiencing financial hardship or other reasons.

Contractor Payments includes the disbursement of over $300 million annually. Due to the dollar value, payment volume, and the nature of contract payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including do not pay matching and other procedures, to identify payments that may be in error. In addition,
invoice reviews are periodically performed to help assess the accuracy of amounts billed. Potential improper payments are subjected to further analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error, and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has
established procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to seek reimbursement from contractors that have been overpaid. Further, under the FAR, previous payments are made are generally subject to adjustment based on over or under payments and any amounts due are normally addressed prior to or at contract closeout.

Payments to Federal Employees includes disbursement of about $150 million annually. PBGC’s payroll and other employee payments are processed by the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center (IBC). PBGC receives a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 report that reports on the DOI IBC payment operations. No weaknesses related to payroll and other employee payments were reported in the most recent SSAE No. 18. Included in PBGC’s and DOI’s internal controls are that a series of personnel actions are needed to change salaries or process bonus payments. Also, employees receive a payroll statement every two weeks. While mistakes can occur in any operation, PBGC has not experienced significant levels of improper payroll payments. Also, if a mistake is identified, any overpayments can be netted against or offset future payments to those employees or deducted from the last paycheck processed after termination. A review of the following did not identify
significant payment issues:
>Improper payment risk assessments,
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Given the historic low risk nature of payroll disbursements, including the existence of adequate payment processing controls and reviews, and the ability to readily recover any improper payments by offset against future payments through normal payroll operations, establishing a separate payment recapture
program for this payment stream is unnecessary and would not be cost effective.

Multiemployer Plan Financial Assistance includes disbursement of over $160 million per year. MEPD generally processes an average of 357 financial assistance payments annually to an average of 95 plans. Multiemployer plans are required to provide proof of plan insolvency, sign promissory agreements, and
undergo an initial audit to determine if the plan is eligible to receive ongoing assistance from the PBGC. Additionally, multiemployer plans are required to provide documentation to support estimates of future expenses prior to receiving financial assistance on a yearly, semi annually, quarterly, or monthly basis. The PBGC’s Multiemployer Program Division (MEPD) reviews all financial assistance requests in accordance with established policies and procedures to verify requests are reasonable, complete, accurate, and comply with ERISA. MEPD rejects or reduces the amount of financial assistance requested by plans if
the administrative and/or benefit expenses do not agree to supporting documentation or if there was a prior overpayment. Additionally, throughout the year, plans submit documentation to support actual expenses incurred to validate a plan’s previous estimate of plan expenses and adjust the most recent financial
assistance request amount if the actual amount of expenses significantly varied from the plan’s initial estimate, and MEPD auditors review this documentation and perform a detailed reconciliation. Multiemployer plans are insolvent and generally have no other sources of financial resources beyond PBGC. In addition, there are just over 100 plans, so this is not a large universe of payees to monitor within the existing structure. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
>improper payment risk assessment
>agency Inspector General reviews,
>Government Accountability Office reports, and
>results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

Given the lower payment dollar value and volume, the nature of the multiemployer plan financial assistance program, payment processing controls, and the ability to adjust future financial assistance amounts by actual expenses incurred, establishing a separate payment recapture program for this payment stream would not be considered cost effective.

Premium Refunds issued ranges roughly $88 to $203 million on an annual basis. All premium refund requests are subject to review  prior to disbursement with larger payments subjected to additional approvals. Given that each pension plan has an ongoing account with PBGC as to premium amounts due, any adjustments for under or over payments can be reflected in the PBGC’s Statement of Account for each plan. Plans may contest any attempt to recapture overpayments. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:
> Improper payment risk assessments,
> agency Inspector General reviews,
> Government Accountability Office reports, and
> results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

In addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes a HR Links report of hours certified by surpervisors and a General Services Administration's report which identifies the payroll amount for the same period.  A comparison of the two reports is completed to verify that the two totals reconcile.  Based on the comparisons, results have not returned any indication of improper payments related to payroll.  Thus, no recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor and employee payments would be deemed cost effective as current management controls are proving effective.

(Unit - Free-Text)","On September 15, 2011, the SBA submitted a Payment Recapture Audit Cost-Effective Analysis to the Office of Management and Budget. The analysis discussed the 7(a) Business Loan Guaranty Program, the 504 Certified Development Company Loan Guaranty Program, the Disaster Direct Loan Program, Disbursements for Goods and Services, the Small Business Investment Company Financing Guaranty Program, the Surety Bond Guaranty Program, and Grants, which included all grant programs. The analysis described the program, the controls over financial disbursements, and the size of the program and concluded for each program that recapture audits would not be cost effective due to low error rates, complexity of the program, or limited amount of outlays. A subsequent cost analysis for the 7(a) loan guaranty purchase program was submitted to OMB on September 13, 2017, to include the results of a payment recapture audit performed in 2015, which again concluded that such an audit is not cost effective. In FY 2022, the SBA performed a cost-benefit analysis for programs with over $1 million in disbursements and not covered by the analysis completed in 2011, and concluded that it would not be cost-effective to perform a recovery audit. Some of the factors considered include the following: program was not identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments in the last risk assessment, there have been no recent audit findings or reports to suggest that the program is susceptible to improper payments, prior internal control assessments did not identify the program as being susceptible to significant improper payments, and the cost to perform a recovery audit exceeded the potential recovery amount. 

In FY 2023, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits. As mentioned above, in prior years, the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses on programs subject to payment recapture audit, and deemed the costs to perform a payment recapture audit outweighed the benefits of the audit. 

In lieu of recovery audits, for programs currently reporting improper payment estimates, the improper payment review testing and results from the testing were leveraged to identify potential payments that could be recovered.  In addition to that, there are also other reviews (internal control assessments, post-award reviews, monthly QA reviews, cost compliance reviews, etc.) conducted on those programs that are outside of the recovery audit process that were also leveraged to identify improper payments.  

Although recovery audits are not performed, the SBA does conduct recovery activities for improper payments identified outside of the recovery audit process.   For example, on 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, overpayments identified in the improper payments review are recaptured from the lender, on disaster direct loans and COVID-EIDL loans, overpayments identified are recovered through loan modifications, on EIDL advances, overpayments can be recovered via fund offsets or referral to OIG, for PPP loans, overpayments can be recovered through loan modifications and repayment, for RRF awards, overpayments are recovered via demand letters sent to awardees, and for SVOG, overpayments are recovered through demand letters, and Treasury debt cross-servicing.","2023"

(Unit - Free-Text)","We meet the recovery activities program requirements of Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for our benefit programs.  We have no plans to conduct payment recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs complexity.  We conducted extensive market research prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents, who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The average claims representative (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position) receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for three years.

We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.275 billion in OASDI and SSI benefit overpayments in fiscal year (FY) 2022 at an administrative cost of $0.06 on average per dollar collected.  We collected $20.162 billion over a 5-year period (FYs 2018–2022).  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.  From 1992–2022, our external collection techniques have yielded $3.497 billion in benefit overpayment recovery.

We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting, and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation system.

We are making improvement in other aspects of our debt collection program.  In FY 2018, we began modernization efforts to build a new Debt Management System.  This information technology investment is a multi year effort that will build a comprehensive overpayment system enabling us to record, track, collect, and report our overpayments more efficiently.

The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions, we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we learn of a beneficiary’s death.  A financial institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation timely.

For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying IPs.  In 2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency fee basis to review our administrative payments.

These employees’ annual performance plans reflect their responsibility to support efforts to maintain sufficient internal controls to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments and meet targets to reduce improper payments.

Senior Executive performance plans must clearly align with organizational goals and objectives under the Results Driven Critical Element, and the performance levels in the performance requirements must reflect agency targets.

To further our focus on reducing improper payments, in fiscal year 2019, we established an Improper Payments Prevention team in the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight (OARO).  The team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payment Alignment Strategies that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate the root causes of improper payments.  We also reestablished the Deputy-Commissioner level Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), which is responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all improper payment initiatives.  The Deputy Commissioner of OARO serves as the executive chair for the IPOB.

"SSA","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY) 2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold, our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security OIG concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements, but we did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements to payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated, “While SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper payments, it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included the following recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”

We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we identify the root causes and evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  IPAS is the process that we use to obtain agency wide engagement and agreement on actions needed to remedy improper payment issues.  In FY 2025, we will complete the IPAS for OASDI computations and draft a new IPAS on relationship.

OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures, and we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when possible.  We will continue to improve technician tools and processes and strengthen our training to better equip our workforce.

OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment.  To reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information, we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment accuracy rate.

For the SSI program, of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.  We will continue to improve notices to make it easier to understand.  As of September 30, 2024, as part of the SSI regulation simplification in-kind and maintenance updates, we removed a significant burden to report receipt of food assistance and reduced reporting burdens for individuals living in public assistance households.  Additionally, the expansion of the rental subsidy may increase the benefit amount some people are eligible to receive and will allow more people to qualify for critical SSI payments.

Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages, we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach, and updating policy in preparation for implementation.

(Unit- Free-Text)","We do not currently use the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Do Not Pay (DNP) system because we have access to the same data as DNP  applicable to our programs such as the General Services Administration’s System for Award Management (SAM), our public version of the Death Master File (DMF), state death data through the Electronic Death Registration process and Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS).

SAM:  We comply with regulations to use the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), which accomplishes the same purpose as the Exclusions query via SAM.gov.  From SAM.gov, we can verify through Entity Registrations if any person or organization is registered to do business with the Federal Government and determine a person or organization’s eligibility to do business with the Federal Government through a check of the Exclusions query.  We are precluded from soliciting offers from, awarding contracts to renew, placing or renewing orders with, or otherwise extending the duration of a current contract with any entity who has been determined ineligible from doing business with the Federal Government unless the head of the agency (or designee) determines there is a compelling reason to do so.

As prescribed in our policy, the State disability determination services (DDS) offices are required to check the LEIE at least annually.  LEIE includes the names of providers excluded from Federally funded health care programs.  The DDS offices also verify medical licenses, credentials, and certifications with State medical boards.

DMF:  The DMF is a publicly available extract of death information created from our internal records (i.e., the Numident).  These records contain information, such as name, Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death of deceased SSN holders.  We update death information on the Numident daily based on information from acceptable reporters (e.g., States, funeral homes, and family members).  We distribute reported death information to our related records using a complex systems interface.  Because our internal death data are more complete than the extracts, we do not use DNP for purposes of verifying death.

State Death Data:  We receive state death data directly from the states through the Electronic Death Registration process.

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) has a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of activities performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of Management Analysis (MA). The subsequent review performed by MA focuses on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department by MA. Because the MA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor would perform, MA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.

Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. MA utilizes several processes that focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part of the Recapture Audit process, MA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has proven to be a cost-effective tool.

In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, MA performs a manual quarterly review of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure proper documentation exists to support sampled payments. However, in 2024, MA vendor recapture audit efforts identified $23 in overpayments, and only $12 was recovered and returned to the originating appropriation. MA also performs a quarterly manual recapture audit of employee claim payments subject to the Department’s overall travel program. This recapture audit focuses on known identified issue areas as well as providing overall audit coverage of employee travel payments.

During 2024, MA built on prior year recapture audit activities by targeting additional payment aspects to ensure all document types are eligible for review. In addition, MA reviewed grant payments within the universe of the domestic and overseas payment program. The additional inclusion of automated and manual recapture audit processes ensures the Department has coverage in required PIIA recapture audit areas.

In 2022, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed 1,398,882 payments totaling $14.3 billion paid by the Department through the DNP portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 170,669 unmatchable payments, totaling $1.5 billion, and adjudicated 74 potential erroneous payment matches as part of the post payment review process. 

The Department continued to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments. At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed, payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment run. In 2022, there were 204,767 annuitant payments totaling $1.1 billion were reviewed against the DMF and 71 payments totaling $320 thousand were stopped due to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF online search prior to making payment.

In addition, Department grants processed through the Health and Human Service (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated a review of the DNP portal into their payment process to identify individuals or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax debt, a recipient that is listed as deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded from doing business with the government. In 2022, the Department was notified of no recipient that appeared ineligible due to results of the DNP process. In addition, in 2022, two recipient payments were stopped as a result of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Debt Management Services, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support), in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) (collection of debts owed to Federal agencies), 31 U.S.C. 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable laws.

(Unit - Free-Text)","Fiscal Service management has determined that conducting recovery audits for its programs would not be cost effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies. Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.* Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury considers these payments negative revenue receipts, not outlays, and thereby exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB agreed that this is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are still required to conduct risk assessments. IRS submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt its non-custodial/bond programs from recovery auditing. The five-year average cost of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured through recovery auditing; all funds recaptured were identified through normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders. For its fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, IRS provided a justification for determination that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current business practices (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical samples conducted under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification of overpayments. The IRS's robust information technology platform includes several filters to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules and payment certification for the various tax credits.* The Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group. * The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments, invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll and benefits) has resulted in a low-risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs an annual review of contract payments using analytic techniques to identify potentially fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment recapture audit activities required a higher cost in employee resources than the amount recovered. * The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group. * The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of the justification was that BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to .004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment reviews. * Treasury’s Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both of which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program had completed all its awards to recipients and shifted to the recipient monitoring phase of the program. Since there was a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity reviews, the risk of improper payments is low. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) consulted, during the application phase, with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risk of improper payments is low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. * Treasury’s Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF) has maintained its own listing and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of internal/quality controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment integrity review, the risk of improper payments is low. * Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts post-approval procedures through SSBCI's  Compliance Program. The application process includes checks to validate identity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs for the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant is not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing improper payments.  * For the Capital Projects Fund (CPF), Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA), and Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), Treasury has implemented multiple levels of control activities including: (1) reviews of single audit reports which facilitates the identification and prevention of costs that may ultimately result in improper payments if not remedied;  and (2) a standardized, cross-program compliance program that includes established compliance testing procedures as well as recipient self-identified reporting, through which improper payments are identified and documented in accordance with non-compliance remediation procedures and remediation action taken. * The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) has an established inter-agency agreement and service level agreement in place with the Treasury's Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support services. As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, to prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since there are payment recovery processes included within the policies and multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.  Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * The Treasury Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) has analyzed several factors and reviewed several current procedures for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to determine if implementation of payment recapture auditing is cost effective These include: a low risk assessment determination, EOAF staff reviews monthly payments for accuracy, obligations are established at a very low detail levels to provide easier control and review of payment activity, the nature of the program payments being made to state and local law enforcement agencies minimizes improper payments, and improper payment review yielded no improper payment issues. Therefore, EOAF has determined the additional cost for staff and resources to conduct payment recapture audits would not be cost effective. * The Office of DC Pensions’ (ODCP) largest payment area is benefits and has a robust multi-tier quality review program that includes in-depth annuitant case review as a part of its normal course of business. Through ODCP's quality review program, significant numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are detected, benefit payments are corrected and debt collection activities begin, as applicable. In addition, all contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include a second level review prior to payment submission.  As such, ODCP had determined that a payment recapture audit is not cost effective as it is very unlikely that any additional overpayments would be identified, i.e., the cost would exceed the benefit.","2024"

Departmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct Loan Financing program is at low risk for improper payments. This loan program is unique in that it contains a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there were eight recipients that received eight large payments and in total, the program disbursed loans to 35 recipients. Program participants entered into stringent legal agreements per guidance stipulated in the CARES Act and instituted per Treasury. There were significant reviews performed at the onset of the program including several levels of review regarding program loan terms and documentation. Further, given these disbursements are loans, which are closely monitored for potential default, Treasury expects to receive the funds back. 

Departmental Office- Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment recovery process instituted within the program’s internal controls system and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting a separate
payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment recovery process is comprised of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying that the prorated payments are within the established percentages and maximum payments allowed for each program participant. The cost of

In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury.  SLFRF worked closely with the ORP Payment Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure the returned amount was documented accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which serves as the ORP payment system of record.  Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. 

Departmental Office- Emergency Rental Assistance-  Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are disbursed following the standard ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Departmental Offices- Emergency Capital Investment Program- During the application phase, ECIP consulted with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial advisers.  ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.

Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)- SIGPR has an established inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement (SLA) in place with the Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support services.  As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis.  ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since there are payment recovery processes included within the aforementioned policies and procedures and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting separate payment recapture audits is minimal and would be duplicative.

"TREASURY","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","Treasury was not in compliance with PIIA for FY 2023 due to Treasury not adequately concluding whether the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers, also known as the Payroll Support Program (PSP), pandemic relief programs are likely to make IPs and UPs above or below the statutory threshold.

The OIG recommendation was Treasury's Risk and Control Group (RCG) should work with the Office of Capital Access (OCA) management to consider all information available when answering risk assessment questions to ensure adequate completion and conclusion of susceptibility for these program-specific risk assessments.

The following are the actions and measurable milestones these programs have planned for this non-compliance criteria: OCA conducted a new risk assessment for FY24 for ERA. The risk assessments reconsidered previous answers and took into account factors beyond the four corners of the assessment template. Additionally, OCA has completed additional risk assessment addendums on program recipient and sub-recipients as coordinated by RCG.  OCA did not conduct a new risk assessment for FY24 for PSP, given that the program has wound down and had less than $10 million in outlays during FY23. However, and as noted in a memo sent to ODCFO on 9/17/24, OCA will conduct a payment recapture audit of PSP. OIG audits of PSP recipients have pointed to the inclusion of unallowable employer-side payroll taxes and corporate officer compensation in recipients' sworn financial statements as causes for overpayments.

Treasury was also found non-compliant for not reporting an improper payment error rate of less than 10% for the IRS Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the refundable Premium Assistance Tax Credit. OIG did not provide any recommendations regarding this non-compliant criteria. Refundable tax credit overclaims are not the result of internal control weaknesses that the IRS can remediate internally, but are in fact the result of factors beyond the Agency's control under the current law and existing authority.","2024"

This comprehensive analysis allows the agency to identify the root cause of improper payments and develop an effective corrective action plan.
At the Rural Housing Service conditions that give rise to improper payments include instances where a tenant misstated their income or how many people are living in the unit or if the owner did not update the paperwork to indicate that the unit was vacant. Supervisory visits, plus checking verifying wage match by state help catch and correct misstatements. 
Single-Family Housing Direct borrowers receiving subsidy must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household becomes employed or changes employment, there is a change in household composition, or if income increases by at least 10 percent.  The failure of the borrower to timely report an increase in household income will likely result in an inaccurate payment.  Borrowers identified as failing to report this increase are reviewed for improper payments.  All borrowers receiving improper payments are notified by mail and granted 30 days to file an appeal of RHS’s decision.

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recommended that SNAP provide information on paymentaccuracy.gov about actions it will take to come into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) requirement. Specifically, the OIG recommended that SNAP establish measurable milestones to comply with PIIA requirements to report an improper payment rate of 10 percent or less. To that end, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has identified the SNAP improper payment rate target as 11 percent for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 performance, 10.5 percent for FY 2025 performance, and 10 percent for FY 2026 performance. To achieve these targets, FNS will continue to conduct training for State agencies on an ongoing basis and will provide additional tools to conduct root cause analysis and identify trends in error rate data. In FY 2025, FNS will facilitate two meetings focused on assisting States in determining their root causes of error and corrective actions to address them. In FY 2026, FNS will launch a new, modernized payment accuracy data management system, which will include enhanced data analytics features to assist State agencies in better utilizing their data for root cause analysis and corrective action planning.

(1) Consolidating the program district director review process into the FSA Internal Review Document and Tracking System to ensure reviews are being completed timely and results are monitored and evaluated to ensure ECP-Disaster policies are being followed.  

(2) Establish additional webinar/virtual training sessions as needed to ensure state office staff are aware of updated policy requirements and clarifications on the requirements.  

(3) Implement a new software platform, new methods for computing payments using payment scenarios, and improve checklists for conducting internal reviews throughout the application, approval and payment process

"USDA","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","During FY 2022, the average number of DNP searches increased by 8% from FY 2021 (109,746 to 118,064). One contributing factor to this change can be attributed to the increase in funding programs received from pandemic-related assistance programs. The various pandemic-related assistance programs broadened USDA programs in a variety of ways including the amount of funding they could provide, a change in eligibility requirements, and other programmatic changes. 
USDA has increased its active users from 1,600 in FY 2021 to 1,780 in FY 2022. These users span five agencies and multiple program areas. The USDA DNP Authorizing Official (AO), in tandem with the Primary Local Security Administrator (PLSA), provided administrative support to programs currently using DNP during the pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment phases of the payment life cycle. USDA has also begun the enrollment and onboarding process with two additional agencies, which will result in the potential of adding approximately 1,500 more DNP users. The enrollment process is expected to be completed during FY 2023.

(Unit- Free-Text)","During FY21 USDA had nearly 1,600 active users spanning five agencies and multiple program areas. In addition, the USDA DNP Authorizing Official (AO), in tandem with the Primary Local Security Administrator (PLSA), provided administrative support to programs currently using DNP during the pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment phases of the payment life cycle. 

The USDA users conducted more than 134,000 online pre-award/pre-payment searches, which is an 8 percent increase from FY 2020. Additionally, USDA increased the average number of DNP matches per quarter by 19 percent from FY 2020. This increase in matching resulted in an 85 percent increase in the potential monetary savings to USDA and the Federal government. 
Throughout FY21 OCFO engaged additional program areas in the DNP program. While the programs are in various stages of the pre-enrollment and enrollment process, OCFO anticipates continued participation from:  Agricultural Marketing Service, Agricultural Research Service, Farm Service Agency, and Food and Nutrition Service.

"USDA","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","USDA continues to utilize Do Not Pay (DNP) in its efforts to mitigate improper payments. USDA programs currently using DNP utilize the Working System (the “Portal”) throughout the payment life cycle. All programs utilize the Portal during the pre-award step, most utilize pre-award and pre-payment, while a few programs utilize pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment. 

The end of the various COVID-19 related assistance programs, which broadened USDA programs in a variety of ways, including the amount of funding available and eligibility requirements, resulted in USDA DNP search activities returning to pre-pandemic levels. During FY 2023, the number of DNP search activities decreased by nearly 95% (118,064 to 5,068) however the total dollar amount matched from those search activities only decreased by approximately 16% ($13.95M to $11.68M). 

USDA has increased its active users by approximately 5% from 1,780 in FY 2022 to 1,869 in FY 2023. These users span five USDA agencies and multiple program areas. USDA consistently increases the number of active users by at least 3% each fiscal year. 

USDA is currently in various stages of the enrollment and onboarding process with four new program areas. With the addition of these four programs, USDA is anticipating increasing user enrollment by 100% to 3400 users. The Department aims to have enrollment for these programs completed during FY 2024.

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency; therefore, many programs' payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in five major areas: Veterans Health Administration for several unique programs providing health care, Veterans Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well as specific recovery audits performed by the Office of Inspector General's additional shared service providers for payroll and Supply Fund payments in the Office of Revolving Fund. These are discussed in more detail below.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration is operationalizing a recovery audit contract which will audit claims from FY 2018 through FY 2023 for Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration Spina Bifida Health Care, and VA Community Care programs. The review includes inpatient claims paid under the following authorities: 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care); 38 U.S.C. § 1728 (service connected unauthorized care); and 38 U.S.C. § 1725 (non-service connected emergency care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.

Veterans Benefits Administration
Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential improper payments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the multiple VA Offices.

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices. VA Staff Offices include but are not limited to the Office of Inspector General, Office of Acquisition Logistics and Construction, Office of Human Resources & Administration, Office of Information Technology, and Office of Management.

The Financial Services Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments.

Office of Inspector General
For improper payments that originate with payroll services, the Office of Inspector General works with two Office of Management and Budget Human Resources Lines of Business Shared Services Providers for its recovery audit requirements: the Bureau of Fiscal Services (Department of Treasury/Bureau of Fiscal Services), and the National Finance Center (Department of Agriculture/National Finance Center). Payroll overpayments and debt can arise for a variety of reasons including salary overpayments due to corrected timecards or personnel actions, debts arising from health and life insurance premiums or “buy backs” of employee leave, and administrative debts at the request of the agency.  The Bureau of Fiscal Services will automatically recalculate employee pay to recover overpayments related to corrected timecards and personnel actions. This process includes a Notification of Salary Overpayment to current employees and a Demand for Payment Notice to separated employees. The National Finance Center leads recovery efforts for overpayments that arise for all other reasons. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the debt is transferred to the United States Department of Treasury debt management for collection.

Office of Revolving Funds
The Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection VA will work towards appropriate resolution.

Veterans Health Administration
VHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract.

The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction. In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection, an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s) to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing. Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a permanent alternative is identified by the customer.

Quantitative factors included the analysis of categorized recovery amounts versus the costs to determine if the benefits of establishing a payment recapture audit program would exceed the costs associated with recovery of overpayments.

Generally, VA Senior Executives are held accountable via the performance appraisal process as established by VA’s Corporate Senior Executive Management Office. This process includes oversight from VA’s Performance Review Board, which evaluates each executive’s performance appraisal, the executive’s response to the initial summary rating, if any, and the results of any higher-level official’s findings and recommendations. Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned with each Senior Executive’s overall level of performance.","2024"

"VA","CAP5","[CAP5]Provide 6-10 sentences summarizing the conclusions and recommendation(s) provided by the OIG for each non-compliant criterion AND the actions and measurable milestones the program has planned to bring each program into compliance with each non-compliant criterion. (Unit - Free-Text) ","In May 2024, the VA Office of Inspector General found 71 VA programs fully compliant with PIIA. The Office of Inspector General found two programs noncompliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports.

The Pension program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. VA's Inspector General recommended that the Pension program reduce improper and unknown payments to below 10%. The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although the Pension program remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall improper and unknown payments, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will improve its ability to reduce improper and unknown payments in the future. This included updating testing procedures to correctly differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments, increasing detail obtained during testing to improve development of effective corrective actions, and improving corrective actions planned for FY 2025. Actions planned regarding automation include continuing quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether a change is needed and making changes, if necessary, prevents future improper payments. Ensuring accurate documentation of Social Security Administration income prevents future improper payments. Actions planned regarding audit include randomly reviewing claims processors’ work to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. Actions planned regarding training include training staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decision to prevent future improper payments. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in May 2027. The Pension program tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments.

In addition, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. The Office of Inspector General recommended that the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program reduce improper and unknown payments to below 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program remains noncompliant, the impact of the program changes in recent years is reflected in a decrease in the improper and unknown payment rate from 38.72% in FY2023 to 13.52% (for a 25.2% reduction) and a $657.90 million decrease in improper payments in FY 2024, despite increases in program spending. Actions planned regarding automation include updating the claims processing system to pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions planned regarding change process include moving to a standardized rate schedule for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition from a legacy system to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates, and will work to implement short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. Further, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. Actions planned regarding training include working internally with facilities to provide education and training to resolve missing documentation related to authorization, payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in May 2028. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments.","2024"

"VA","dpa5","[dpa5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences discussing the agency use of Do Not Pay Initiative and an evaluation of whether it has reduced Improper Payments or awards. (Unit- Free-Text)","Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper payments by $9.6 billion, a 65% reduction, and removed a total of seven programs from reporting requirements. In FY 2021, VA reports its largest reduction to date of $6.3 billion in improper and unknown payments, a reduction of over 50% from FY2020 results. VA also removed five programs (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), Compensation, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Prosthetics, and State Home Per Diem) from improper payment reporting, as statistically valid testing showed these programs did not have significant improper payments. The removal of these five programs resulted in a total savings of over 25,000 staff hours that could pivot to other work and $340K in contractor costs that would save taxpayer dollars.

VA does not attribute this success to the Treasury Working System, but to the prioritization placed upon and implemented by its employees across the Department to improve internal controls that have resulted in reduction and prevention of improper payments. Agency specific efforts over the last three years include the development of business rules to check for duplicate payments in data repositories and increased use of electronic invoicing and optical character recognition technology.  Additional efforts include artificial intelligence built into the claims processing system that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. 

Although OMB provided guidance that DNP Initiative responses requested in this section are specific to the Treasury Working System, VA included a discussion of its agency specific efforts to prevent improper payments because previously the DNP Initiative was cited as including the Working System and other agency-specific efforts. This can be found in GAO's October 2016 report “Improper Payments: Strategy and Additional Actions Needed to Help Ensure Agencies Use the Do Not Pay Working System as Intended”.","2021"

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA fulfills the requirements of the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative and reviews payments against Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) required databases. VA utilizes the Treasury Working Systems (TWS) as appropriate. VA utilizes the TWS payment integration functionality. Payment integration consists of matching payments against available TWS data sources at the time of disbursement. Specifically, VA submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to the Department of Treasury for matching against the TWS data sources. The Department of Treasury uses DNP to perform matching of PAM Payments to TWS data sources and provides a PAM count of stopped payments and/or count of matched payments. The TWS match results are available in the TWS the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results and review and adjudication of TWS matches are performed in accordance with VA processes and procedures. There are two reports available for download in the TWS. The Payment Activity Report (PAR) provides VA a summary of the PAM payments, matches, and adjudication statuses. The Adjudication Summary report provides VA the summary adjudication status results each month. VA adjudicates matches within the TWS on a monthly basis. Therefore, VA is only able to use the TWS to confirm improper payments after the payment has been already made and prevent future improper payments once due process is provided for payment integration. In addition, VA utilizes single search and continuous monitoring when appropriate, unless other already established processes outside the TWS exists. Reports are not currently available from TWS on the results of single search and continuous monitoring.","2024"

VA adjudicates matches within the TWS on a monthly basis. VA sends Treasury a file containing all of VA's payments. Specifically, VA submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to Treasury for matching against the TWS data sources. VA payments are matched against the TWS databases at the time of disbursement and the TWS match results are available in the TWS the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results and review/adjudication of TWS matches are performed in accordance with VA processes and procedures. Therefore, VA is only able to use the TWS to confirm improper payments after the payment has already been made and potentially prevent future improper payments once due process is provided.  

Additionally, the Veterans Benefit Administration is currently piloting the Death Record Confidence (DRC) Scoring Tool, a new tool developed by DNP to help analytic customers prioritize their research efforts, improve their adjudication processes, and make informed decisions about payment eligibility. This tool is intended to enable DNP to more effectively identify deceased individuals within a dataset and help customers understand which payments are at risk of being issued to a deceased payee. The DRC Scoring tool includes access to the Electronic Verification of Vital Events Facts of Death. The new data source contains information about death certificates contained within the vital records of 44 participating states and jurisdictions. VA will utilize any TWS reports created by Treasury for using this functionality in future required reporting.

The Veterans Benefit Administration Insurance program utilizes the continuous monitoring file and has the ability to submit a file and receive matches before payments are made. Currently, there are no reports within TWS that track identification and/or prevention of improper payments that would enable VA to report on use of this function.","2023"
