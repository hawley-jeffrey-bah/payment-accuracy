State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.

States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper payments. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.

ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13);
•	Treasury Offset Program (TOP) (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19 and 12-14);
•	Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and
•	Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).

ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:
•	State Income Tax Offset Program;
•	Wage Garnishments;
•	Civil Actions;
•	Property Liens;
•	Collection Agency Referrals;
•	Credit Bureau Referrals;
•	Probate and bankruptcy;
•	Referral to DOL-OIG and law enforcement;
•	State/Federal prosecution;
•	Offset lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;
•	Skip tracing;
•	Establishment of interest and penalties on overpayments, which adds an incentive to repay quickly;

"HHS","ara2_1","[ara2_1]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences explaining the methods used by the agency to recover Improper Payments identified in recovery AUDITS. (Unit- Free-Text)","The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified in recovery audits across various programs:

Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments by issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the identified amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from future payments made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily submit a refund to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper payment.

Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations, the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation audits in FY 2024.

Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an analysis of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare Part D coverage. Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors are notified of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation is provided.

Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of Medicaid overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.

Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt's existence and including claim-specific information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury for collection.

These methods demonstrate a systematic approach to recovering improper payments in various healthcare programs, ensuring that funds are appropriately recovered while providing avenues for resolution and reconciliation where necessary.","2023"

The CPD Community Development Block Grant – DRAA-Sandy program monitors disaster recovery activities for Federally declared disaster arepas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The grantee submits a quarterly performance report using the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system that is reviewed by CPD field offices or HUD headquarters. The performance reports are used to review the grant expenditures and accomplishments for all CDBG-DR funded activities. The grantee also uses the DRGR system to submit vouchers and drawdown funds. After a voucher is created and submitted by a grantee Drawdown Requester, the voucher line items must be reviewed and approved by the grantee Drawdown Approver. If a line item is approved, it is either sent to the Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) for processing, or, if the grant drawdown threshold of $5 million has been reached, it is sent to HUD for review and approval before it can be submitted to LOCCS. CPD also monitors the grantee’s efforts to prevent the duplication of benefits and ensure programmatic compliance. 
CPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement, and equipment. The exhibits located in Chapter 6 of the CPD Monitoring Handbook, serve the purpose of capturing improper payments identified in the program file-level reviews during on-site or remote monitoring. If any improper payments are identified the reviewer must indicate on the monitoring exhibit the program area, amount, type of improper payment and the corrective action. The grantee is notified of any improper payments identified during the monitoring review at the exit conference. If the grantee is unable to provide documentation to resolve the improper payment, a finding will be issued in the Monitoring Report which is transmitted to the grantee within 90 days of the monitoring review. In most cases, CPD recaptures overpayments by offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD typically instructs the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal sources to their grant’s line of credit in LOCCS, or to Treasury’s account if the grant has closed or the funding availability period has expired. Additionally, CPD may also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. 
Additionally, HUD monitors all high-risk grantees annually and, in some instances, bi-annually. Although these monitoring engagements do not exclusively include a review of improper payments, the reviewers are able to identify improper payments during the file review. If a grantee must repay HUD, CPD will coordinate with the applicable offices depending on the amount being repaid. A remittance to the line of credit of less than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury Financial Communications System (TFCS).

(Salaries and Expenses - ADMN, CFO, CIO, CPD, Chief Procurement Officer (CPO), FHEO, Ginnie Mae, HSNG, OCFO, OCHCO, OCIO, PDR, PIH)

The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. 
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the POI 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the Payroll, Benefits, and Retirement Division’s (PBRD) quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated.
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g. Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC).
OCFO-Budget provides assistance to program budget offices by flagging payroll corrections or unusual payroll activity as part of a bi-weekly payroll projection process. OCFO-Budget also works with program offices and ARC to correct these issues.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

(Lead Hazard Reduction – OLHCHH)

During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The risks of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal.

Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports.

The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, 
which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2022"

During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action.

Salaries and Expenses
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated. 
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan. 
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC. 
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

MultiFamily Notes
The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. Each note is serviced in accordance with the mortgage and mortgage note documents. Servicing activities include billing, collections, disbursements, escrow management, and processing of terminations. Servicing activities are performed daily until termination of the note from the system. 
Taxes and R4R escrows are incorporated into the note and managed by the note. Amounts collected are all pre-determined by the language within the note itself. Payment amounts (R4R costs, insurance, taxes and miscellaneous A/P) are calculated based on invoices submitted. 
All disbursements are initially processed by the contractor. However, the Multifamily Notes Servicing Branch (MFNSB) staff have final approval on all disbursements. No disbursements are made by the contractor without approval from the MFNSB. Disbursements are approved by HUD. 
Each payment request has an invoice and physical approval. Separation of duties is maintained for the disbursement process. Contract staff create the transmittal to allow the disbursement; a second contract staff approves the transmittal; a third contract staff creates the disbursement. None of the staff have the authority to perform any other duty in the payment process. Upon receipt of the disbursement request from the contractor, it is reviewed by MFNSB staff to ensure the requested disbursement is correct and in compliance with HUD guidelines. Employees conduct data matching analytics to verify key information for disbursements such as project name, address, FHA number, iREMS number, and dollar amount. For payment schedules the Tax ID Number, Routing Number, Deposit Account Number, and Dollar Amount are validated against supporting documentation to ensure accuracy. 
Once the disbursements are reviewed and approved by MFNSB, they are sent to the Cash Management Branch (CMB) for certification and processing. Payments are disbursed directly to the vendor responsible for collecting the disbursement and applying the funds to the expense. Contract staff perform daily banking functions to ensure all checks have been cashed and ACH transactions processed. 
Once the Certifying Officer in CMB certifies the schedule for payment, CMB sends the Secure Payment System (SPS) Report via email to the MFNSB. Staff compares the schedule payment package to the daily SPS Report and to the Goal Report Agency Location Codes (ALC) Payment Details to ensure the payment information is correct. In addition, all cash activities are reconciled through monthly accounting reconciliations. These payments are also post payment checked 
On a monthly basis, the MFNSB Chief conducts random sampling of payment schedules. A sampling of 20% of paid schedules is selected and reviewed for accuracy of information and payment. There have been no inaccuracies or overpayments cited. In the event of an overpayment of taxes or hazard insurance, the contractor will work with the tax authority or insurance provider to recoup the overpayment. If the contractor is unable to recover the funds they will escalate the issue to MFNSB, which will work with the account executive, the Office of General Counsel, and the program area to ensure the overpayment is recaptured. In the event of an overpayment of R4R, the contractor will work with the management agent to recoup the overpayment. If the management agent fails to return the overpayment within 30 days, MFNSB will notify the account executive and program area. The overpayment will be included in the next scheduled billing statement and the management agent will be issued a formal notification of the action.

Federal Housing Administration
The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.
The FOC is responsible for managing the business operations for the Title I loan program, which includes registering and endorsing loans for insurance, billing and collecting premiums, and examining claims for loss and approving them for payment. The FOC is also responsible for performing the debt collection and servicing activities for Title I Notes (defaulted Title I loans) and generic debts (other FHA debts).
The Title I program authorizes HUD to insure lenders against default on loans used to finance property improvements and to purchase manufactured homes. Lenders are required to pay premiums covering the insurance of their loans and submit applications for insurance benefits for defaulted loans. HUD is required to collect the unpaid loan balance, including eligible expenses, from the defaulted borrower.
The FOC’s Title I Insurance Processing Branch (TIIPB) is responsible for evaluating and approving lender applications for insurance benefits. The lender’s application must include loan information and any documentation necessary for the TIIPB to calculate a claim payment. There are three types of claim: initial, resubmitted, and supplemental. An initial claim is a first submission. A resubmitted claim is one that the TIIPB had previously denied. A supplemental claim is an additional claim for the same loan when the lender finds documentation for expenses not included in the initial claim. TIIPB support staff establish the claim in the Title I Insurance and Claims System (TIIS/F72). The process includes assigning a claim number, entering the date the claim was received, and assigning the claim to a TIIPB examiner. The examiner conducts a full review of the claim to determine whether the loan complies with Title I underwriting and servicing requirements and whether expenses claimed by the lender are supported by the documentation provided. If these conditions are satisfied, the examiner processes the claim calculation and authorization for payment in TIIS/F72. TIIS/F72 processes the payments authorized on the same day in a single batch file, sends the file to Treasury’s Payment Application Modernization system, and sends another file to the Cash Management Branch to authorize the Treasury disbursement. TIIS/F72 sends a file of paid claims to the Debt Collection and Management System – Title I (DCAMS-TI/F71), which converts the paid claims to notes receivable. The FOC’s Asset Recovery Division (ARD) is responsible for pursuing collection against the debtor (defaulted borrower).
The TIIPB conducts quality reviews of paid Title I claims to ensure consistent processing and examination quality. Each month, the TIIPB Branch Chief randomly selects 10% of paid claims for review. The Branch Chief either reviews the claim themselves or assigns them to examiners for a peer review. The reviewer conducts a full examination of the claim and reports whether the claim payment was conforming (compliant/no deficiencies), deficient (minor issues to address), unacceptable (serious issues to address), or mitigated (issues found but readily resolved). The outcomes of quality reviews are documented in both the Case Notes screen of TIIS/F72 and in the Title I Quality Reviews folder of the FOC’s SharePoint site.
If the review identified a deficiency that resulted in an overpaid claim, the TIIPB Branch Chief or examiner will issue a request to the lender for a full (for an unacceptable claim) or partial (for a deficient claim) repurchase of the loan. The request instructs the lender to repurchase the loan by remitting payment to a designated lockbox within 30 days or to ask for a reconsideration of the repurchase request within 10 days. If the lender fails to submit documentation that satisfactorily resolves the deficiency or to remit payment within the established timeframes, TIIPB issues a repurchase demand which gives the lender 30 days to remit the repurchase funds and informs the lender of the actions HUD will take if the funds aren’t remitted, including transferring the unpaid repurchase to the FOC’s ARD for delinquent debt collection, which includes referral to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for administrative offset.
Both paid and unpaid repurchase requests and demands involve coordination between the FOC’s TIIPB and ARD. The ARD ensures that the Title I Note receivable is reclassified as a full or partial repurchase. Payments for full and partial repurchases are sent to the Title I Notes lockbox which transmits a collection file to DCAMS-TI/F71 to credit the funds to the Title I Note receivable associated with the claim. The ARD notifies the TIIPB when repurchase funds are received and the TIIPB updates the claim record in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04). For full repurchases, the ARD closes the Title I Note receivable as repurchased. Before closing out the receivable, the ARD will issue the debtor (defaulted Title I borrower) a refund for any non-repurchase collections received. The TIIPB returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I promissory note and lien, if applicable.
Unpaid full or partial repurchase requests and demands are transferred to the ARD for delinquent debt collection. The ARD establishes a Title I Repurchase receivable in the Debt Collection and Asset Management System – Generic Debt (DCAMS-GD/F71A), which initiates the collection process by issuing an automated demand letter describing the debt and instructing the lender to remit payment in full within 30 days or contact the designated ARD Debt Servicing Representative (DSR) to request a plan to repay the debt in installments. If the lender does not pay the debt in full or enter a repayment plan within 30 days, DCAMS-GD/F71A issues a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Collect by Administrative Offset. The NOI notifies the lender that HUD intends to refer the debt to the TOP, describes the TOP process for administrative offset of federal payments, and provides the lender with steps to take to contest the basis of the debt or the amount demanded by filing an appeal with HUD’s Board of Appeals (BOA) within 65 days. If the lender files an appeal, DCAMS-GD/F71A suspends referral to TOP pending a decision and order from the BOA administrative law judge. (BOA adjudicates appeals by gathering and evaluating statements and documents from both parties.) If the BOA judge issues a decision and order declaring the debt unenforceable, the ARD closes the debt as unenforceable and notifies the TIIPB. The TIIPB will reverse the pending repurchase in TIIS/F72. If the decision and order results in a dismissal of the lender’s appeal, the DSR updates debt status in DCAMS-GD/F71A making the debt eligible for referral to TOP. DCAMS-GD/F71A refers eligible debts that are 121 or more days delinquent to TOP and the Treasury Cross-Servicing Program. DCAMS-GD/F71A also reports lenders to commercial credit reporting agencies (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax).
The TIIPB may, rather than transfer the unpaid repurchase to the ARD for delinquent debt collection, pursue internal offset of payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. In most cases, however, it’s more effective to transfer the debt to the ARD, since any federal payment made to the lender, including Title I claim payments, will be collected through TOP.
Collections, both voluntary and involuntary, received on a Title Repurchase debt are credited to the account. When a debt is paid in full, the ARD makes entries in DCAMS-GD/F71A to close out the debt as paid in full and to close out the Title I Note receivable as unenforceable. The TIIPB makes entries in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04) to acknowledge satisfaction of the repurchase demand and returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I Promissory Note and lien, if applicable.
 If the ARD concludes that the Title I Repurchase debt is uncollectible, it takes steps to close out the debt in DCAMS-GD/F71A, which will issue an IRS Form 1099-C to the lender and report the debt accordingly to the IRS. The TIIPB will pursue secondary recovery activities on the uncollectible repurchase by internally offsetting future claims payments to the lender or blocking payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. The TIIPB may also refer the lender to FHA’s Mortgagee Review Board for sanctions
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the TOP and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender, which is usually resolved within 30 days of final settlement. The mortgagee either returns the overpaid funds or files a supplemental claim. If the overpayment is not resolved within the 30-day or 60-day period after final settlement, the reviewer sends a follow-up letter at the end of each period advising the mortgagee of the penalties and interest assessed. If still not resolved after 90 days, the overpayment is electronically transferred to HUD’s FOC in Albany, New York for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS.

The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies.

For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g., Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC.
Additionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s OCPO HUD CPO in the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of improper payments.
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.

Lead Hazard Reduction
During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action. 
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. 
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the OLHCHH reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation.

The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed. 
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents. 
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset. 
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year. 
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery. 
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent. 
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies. 
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted. 
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate. 
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt). 
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.","2023"

(Unit- Free-Text)","The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) has a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of activities performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of Management Analysis (MA). The subsequent review performed by MA focuses on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department by MA. Because the MA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor would perform, MA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.

Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. MA utilizes several processes that focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part of the Recapture Audit process, MA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has proven to be a cost-effective tool.

In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, MA performs a manual quarterly review of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure proper documentation exists to support sampled payments. However, in 2024, MA vendor recapture audit efforts identified $23 in overpayments, and only $12 was recovered and returned to the originating appropriation. MA also performs a quarterly manual recapture audit of employee claim payments subject to the Department’s overall travel program. This recapture audit focuses on known identified issue areas as well as providing overall audit coverage of employee travel payments.

During 2024, MA built on prior year recapture audit activities by targeting additional payment aspects to ensure all document types are eligible for review. In addition, MA reviewed grant payments within the universe of the domestic and overseas payment program. The additional inclusion of automated and manual recapture audit processes ensures the Department has coverage in required PIIA recapture audit areas.

(Unit- Free-Text)","VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency; therefore, many programs' payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in five major areas: Veterans Health Administration for several unique programs providing health care, Veterans Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well as specific recovery audits performed by the Office of Inspector General's additional shared service providers for payroll and Supply Fund payments in the Office of Revolving Fund. These are discussed in more detail below.

Veterans Health Administration
Veterans Health Administration is operationalizing a recovery audit contract which will audit claims from FY 2018 through FY 2023 for Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration Spina Bifida Health Care, and VA Community Care programs. The review includes inpatient claims paid under the following authorities: 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care); 38 U.S.C. § 1728 (service connected unauthorized care); and 38 U.S.C. § 1725 (non-service connected emergency care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.

Veterans Benefits Administration
Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential improper payments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the multiple VA Offices.

Financial Services Center
The Financial Services Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices. VA Staff Offices include but are not limited to the Office of Inspector General, Office of Acquisition Logistics and Construction, Office of Human Resources & Administration, Office of Information Technology, and Office of Management.

The Financial Services Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments.

Office of Inspector General
For improper payments that originate with payroll services, the Office of Inspector General works with two Office of Management and Budget Human Resources Lines of Business Shared Services Providers for its recovery audit requirements: the Bureau of Fiscal Services (Department of Treasury/Bureau of Fiscal Services), and the National Finance Center (Department of Agriculture/National Finance Center). Payroll overpayments and debt can arise for a variety of reasons including salary overpayments due to corrected timecards or personnel actions, debts arising from health and life insurance premiums or “buy backs” of employee leave, and administrative debts at the request of the agency.  The Bureau of Fiscal Services will automatically recalculate employee pay to recover overpayments related to corrected timecards and personnel actions. This process includes a Notification of Salary Overpayment to current employees and a Demand for Payment Notice to separated employees. The National Finance Center leads recovery efforts for overpayments that arise for all other reasons. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the debt is transferred to the United States Department of Treasury debt management for collection.

Office of Revolving Funds
The Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection VA will work towards appropriate resolution.

Veterans Health Administration
VHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract.

The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction. In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection, an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s) to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing. Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a permanent alternative is identified by the customer.
