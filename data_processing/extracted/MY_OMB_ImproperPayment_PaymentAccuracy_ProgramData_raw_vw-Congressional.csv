"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit","rac3","The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) became refundable only for Tax Year (TY) 2021, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), as part of the COVID-19 pandemic assistance programs. The changes to the CDCTC were temporary, applying only to TY 2021. The short-term nature of this program limits the IRS’s ability to calculate improper payment estimates. To generate an improper payment estimate, the IRS needs to conduct comprehensive audits over a large sample of tax returns, requiring at least three years’ worth of data to ensure accuracy. However, because ARPA’s changes to the CDCTC were limited to TY 2021, there isn’t enough time or data to create an estimate before the refundable nature of this program ends. Accordingly, the credit has no basis for improper payment estimates. In August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. However, these programs will remain on the three-year risk assessment rotation.","[rac3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the program is in Phase 2 but is not reporting an improper payment and unknown payment estimate for the current reporting year and provide the fiscal year that the program is expected to be able to report an estimate.

"HUD","Public and Indian Housing - Rental Housing Assistance Program - Tenant Based Rental Assistance - Section 8 - Housing Certificate Fund & Tenant Based Rental Assistance","rac3","During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned improvements to establish effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) program. The goal is to prevent and detect improper payments, as outlined in the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan. Currently, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public housing agenciey’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD evaluated existing reports for estimating improper payment rates but found they did not meet the stringent requirements set by the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). Additionally, these reports could not generate reliable error estimates with sufficient precision to cover the entire payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.

Looking ahead to FY 2025 and beyond, and as funding is available, HUD will continue implementing the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and will explore testing methods for sub-populations within the TBRA portfolio. By exploring other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit from efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through the following initiatives:

•The Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) is set to significantly improve the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. It will modernize how HUD records monthly HCV performance and automate cash management transactions as well as financial reporting. eVMS will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of housing assistance payments (HAPs), thereby reducing prepaid expenses and accounts payables. This will be achieved by using real-time family-level data that PHAs submit to HUD via the HUD-50058 through IMS PIC. The system will also perform month-to-month reconciliations for retroactive adjustments due to annual income certifications or changes in family composition. Moreover, eVMS will calculate and track administrative fees across all voucher programs, simplifying decision-making for PHAs regarding voucher issuance and other program needs by providing daily online views of PHA funding balances. Overall, eVMS will automate cash management payments and reconciliations, streamline reporting for HUD’s financials, and generate data to test elements within payee and eligibility tiers.

•HUD is also advancing one key project, a beta version of the Enhanced EIV tool, which uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to identify income trends and changes. The system improvements will strengthen preventative controls at the time of initial applications and renewals, with a focus on eligibility. The Enhanced EIV tool will help identify income discrepancies during tenant applications and renewals, providing PHAs with immediate access to income data reported by other partners. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk of improper payments resulting from income discrepancies. By leveraging both current and historical data alongside predictive analytics, HUD will be able to pinpoint trends and forecasts concerning family income. The enhancements will eventually expand to involve multiple stakeholders, including all housing authorities. The Enhanced EIV tool will offer a comprehensive view across the department for all PHAs, ensuring that accurate tenant-level information is used for determining Voucher Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) eligibility. This holistic perspective will aid in identifying discrepancies between tenant-reported income and data from other partners and federal agencies, such as the National Database of New Hires from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

These initiatives reflect HUD's commitment to enhancing the integrity and efficiency of the TBRA program, ultimately benefiting the communities we serve and demonstrating a strong commitment to payment integrity.

"TREASURY","Departmental Offices - Emergency Rental Assistance","rac3","In May 2024, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program was determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments for the fiscal year 2023 OMB A-123 assessment period. In response to the May 2024 determination, the Office of Capital Access (OCA) is evaluating options to address the potential and actual improper payments and any unknown payments in ERA. OCA is coordinating with Treasury's Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer in establishing next steps for these programs, including timelines.

In August 2022, Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. In addition, because the ERA program has concluded almost all of its disbursements, there is no basis for improper payment estimates going forward.","[rac3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the program is in Phase 2 but is not reporting an improper payment and unknown payment estimate for the current reporting year and provide the fiscal year that the program is expected to be able to report an estimate.

"TREASURY","Departmental Offices - Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers","rac3","In May 2024, the Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers Program, also known as the Payroll Support Program (PSP), was determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments for the fiscal year 2023 OMB A-123 assessment period. In response to the May 2024 determination, the Office of Capital Access (OCA) is evaluating options to address the potential and actual improper payments and any unknown payments in this program. OCA is coordinating with the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO) in establishing next steps for these programs, including timelines.

In August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. In addition, because these programs have concluded, there is no basis for improper payment estimates going forward.","[rac3]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the program is in Phase 2 but is not reporting an improper payment and unknown payment estimate for the current reporting year and provide the fiscal year that the program is expected to be able to report an estimate.
