The results of the testing revealed situations where the grantee was unable to provide the required documentation to support the payment and/or the documentation provided was insufficient. In these situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation or adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as either proper or improper could have been made.  

For disbursements related to agency-managed members: There was one payment in with NST where the documentation at the agency level was unavailable, and a determination as to whether the payment was proper or improper was not able to be made.

"DHS","Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Funeral Assistance","rnp3","The majority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified Improper Payments (IPs) stemmed from the required human intervention for manually processing COVID-19 Funeral Assistance disbursements. As such, the majority of the FEMA corrective actions taken have focused on policy and procedural enhancements, training, and process improvements to reduce and prevent future IPs. The COVID-19 pandemic brought overwhelming grief to many families. FEMA has remained committed to help people before, during, and after disasters and is dedicated to helping ease some of the financial stress and burden caused by the virus. 

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, appropriated additional funding to the Disaster Relief Fund to reimburse funeral expenses incurred through December 31, 2020. Subsequently, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA; enacted March 11,2021) also required FEMA to provide Funeral Assistance for deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and did not limit the date for expenses incurred. FEMA began accepting applications on April 12, 2021 and, per FEMA’s policy, the agency will reimburse for eligible funeral expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, for deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the COVID-19 incident period ended on May 11, 2023, FEMA will continue to provide funeral assistance reimbursements until September 30, 2025 to those that have lost loved ones due to the pandemic. 

As highlighted above, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program related to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to complete all disbursement activity by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2025 and has seen substantial reductions in the program's disbursement size and activity already. For example, in the less than six months of FY 2021 that FEMA disbursed Funeral Assistance, the program disbursed over $1,166 million. For the full FY 2022 reporting period, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program disbursed just over $1,697 million. Disbursement activity for the FEMA Funeral Assistance program is down to just over $300 million in FY 2023. With the reduction in the program size coupled with the expected end of the program in September 2025, it is not cost beneficial for the agency to implement extensive corrective actions for the sunsetting program in FY 2025.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

FEMA is also providing detailed instructions and examples of information processing that staff should verify on the internet and how to appropriately document within the application file record comments. In the early stages of COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, the internet search was not an option to resolving missing verification points. This was causing multiple calls to applicants asking them to provide the information, when funeral homes were not responding to verification calls, and leading to a high number of ineligible cases. Later guidance was updated to include an internet search in order to find information that would help with the verification process and reduce the burden on the applicant to provide.

It is designed to be flexible and support the range of recovery needs. The program delivery model, built on standard roles and processes, enables the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to employ a risk-based approach that recognizes that not all Applicants or projects require the same level of resources, documentation, or oversight. FEMA adjusts its approach based on risks. The risk-based approach balances developing policy, delivering the program, and prioritizing resources to maintain an efficient use of resources. FEMA prioritizes resources and effort where risk and complexity are high. That means ensuring personnel and technical resources are made available, and administrative oversight is more in-depth, where a disaster, Applicant, or project represents a higher risk in one or more of the four risk areas–Mission, Finances, Program, and Reputation. By contrast, FEMA limits level of effort, resources, and administrative oversight where risk is low. That means assigning fewer personnel or technical resources and decreasing requirements and level of review where an applicant or project does not pose a significant risk in one or more of the four risk areas.

They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including a control environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any improper payments that may occur. Management’s efforts, to include within DHS Headquarters as well Components, around improper payments are subject to an annual compliance review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). These measures are designed to hold the appropriate personnel accountable for meeting applicable improper payment reduction targets and establishing and maintaining strong internal controls around payment management. 

Department-wide, the goals and requirements for strong payment integrity are communicated to all levels of staff throughout the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office and procurement staff. The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable officers, to include Component Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), programs, States, and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments. The Department’s CFO and senior staff have incorporated improper payment expectations and performance in their annual performance plans. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regularly engages with recipients and process owners in monthly remediation meetings to ensure that appropriate accountable officials are actively taking actions to reduce Improper Payments (IPs) and identify and categorize Unknown Payment (UP) transactions as either proper or improper. If a transaction is deemed proper, no further action is taken. If a transaction is deemed technically improper, FEMA requires a corrective action be put in place in order resolve issues surrounding procedures, policies, and trainings. If a transaction is deemed improper and is associated with monetary loss, then the transaction is submitted through the FEMA debt collection process including Notice of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset, if applicable. 

In addition, FEMA tracks any changes to the program. Training, information sharing, and the documentation of new processes will be prioritized.

Without adequate supporting documentation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is unable to discern whether the payments were proper or improper as the disbursement could not be reconciled to the terms and conditions of the agreement. In order to assert to the appropriateness of the payment, FEMA generally requests the following information from the recipients:
•	Proof of payment documenting drawdown paid to correct subgrantee / disaster
•	Private nonprofit support to include Facility Questionnaire, Internal Review Service (IRS) Letter confirming status, etc.
•	Support for Private Property Debris Removal
•	Documentation to substantiate the work as eligible and the cost estimate as reasonable

Based on the timing and identification of the Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) error rate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program, the fiscal year (FY) 2025 Budget request had already been developed. FEMA is confident that the resourcing already requested and included in the FY 2025 Budget, examples noted below, is sufficient to establish and maintain internal controls, human capital, and information system and other infrastructure to reduce IPs and UPs. 

FEMA continues to implement its mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters. The agency has carried out this mission and helped communities across the Nation respond to natural hazards and emergencies. FEMA has learned that emergency management is a shared responsibility among the whole community, where disaster operations are federally supported, State managed, and locally executed. The FY 2025 Budget request continues investments in implementing this framework and advances priorities established by the Administration. Additionally, the FEMA Administrator has identified three goals critical to the Agency’s mission aligned with leadership’s vision for emergency management: 

1.	Instill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency Management
•	Cultivate a FEMA that prioritizes and harnesses a diverse workforce
•	Remove barriers to FEMA programs through a people first approach
•	Achieve equitable outcomes for those that FEMA serves

2.	Lead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience
•	Increase climate literacy among the emergency management community
•	Build a climate resilient nation
•	Empower risk-informed decision making

3.	Promote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation
•	Strengthen the emergency management workforce
•	Posture FEMA to meet current and emergent threats
•	Unify coordination and delivery of federal assistance 

The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the appropriation FEMA uses to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm State and tribal resources pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, P.L. 93-288 (as amended), 42 U.S. Code sections 5121-5207. Specifically, the DRF can provide funding for Stafford Act declarations or activities that include: (1) pre-declaration surge activities; (2) emergency declarations; (3) major disaster declarations; (4) fire management assistance grants (FMAGs); and (5) Disaster Readiness and Support (DRS) activities. Through the DRF, FEMA can authorize Federal disaster support activities as well as eligible State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) actions such as emergency protection and debris removal. The DRF also funds the repair and rebuilding of eligible disaster damaged infrastructure, eligible hazard mitigation projects, financial assistance to eligible disaster survivors, and FMAGs for eligible large wildfires. In the DHS FY 2025 Budget, FEMA has requested:
•	A major disaster allocation to address ongoing Stafford Act disasters. The FY 2025 budget request includes funding for continued recovery efforts in support of COVID-19, Hurricanes Maria, Fiona, and Ian, and other disaster activity. 

In addition, Operations and Support (O&S) provides core mission development and maintenance of an integrated, nationwide capability to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the consequences of major disasters and emergencies regardless of cause, in partnership with other Federal agencies, SLTT governments, volunteer organizations, and the private sector. Activities supported by this account incorporate the essential command and control functions, mitigate long-term risks, ensure the continuity and restoration of essential services and functions and provide leadership to build, sustain, and improve the coordination and delivery of support to citizens and SLTT governments. In the DHS FY 2025 Budget, FEMA has requested:
•	A program change to the O&S related to Disaster Workforce Readiness. The increase in staffing would provide training and education enhancements for the FEMA Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT) and Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) cadres. The staffing increase is for critical and highly specialized positions, closing capability gaps and ensuring the Agency is ready to respond to disasters of increasing frequency and impacts and meet the need of survivors. Laws such as the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, the Post Sandy Recovery Act, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 have set requirements for FEMA to gain and maintain capabilities to not only coordinate the Federal family’s ability to provide lifesaving and life sustaining resources and activities during disasters, but to also be the industry leader in training and education of the emergency management field across all levels of society. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reports and findings have identified where FEMA has experienced successes, shortcomings, and gaps in mission delivery and have provided recommendations on how and where to apply resources to address shortfall. This includes FEMA’s ability to execute the requirements established in Section 302 (Coordinating Officers) and Section 303 (Emergency Support and Response Teams) of the Stafford Act. Developing and maintaining professional development programs for FCOs and IMATs is necessary to advance the Administrator’s stated goals for the management and support of FEMA’s field leaders. These requirements, both new and with enhancements to existing programs, will enhance the readiness of FEMA’s FCO and IMAT cadres and will enable increased Field Leadership capabilities.
•	A program change to the O&S related to Grants Management Modernization (GMM). The increase in funding would allow for the sustainment of the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) Program FEMA Grant Outcomes (FEMA GO), Preparedness Grant Systems Portfolio (PGSP), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Environmental and Historic Preservation Management Information System (EMIS), and Mitigation Electronic Grants (MT-eGrants). With these additional resources FEMA will be able to manage risk and implement sufficient controls over the grants that it administers as well as provide mission critical services and support to disaster survivors, program staff, and stakeholders. Specifically, these resources will enable the Legacy Grant Management Systems to provide adequate system’s operation and maintenance capabilities to improve the cybersecurity protection for FEMA’s intellectual property, including the FEMA GO software, and protect recipient data and FEMA data contained in the FEMA GO system.

Furthermore, for the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) overseas entitlement program, the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) uses a physically signed signature card which is then uploaded into the application. The system is not able to provide a signing official's signature through a digital Common Access Card (CAC) signature. There were samples that did not have signatures on the Standard Form (SF) 1190s in DAPS due to the transition from DoDEA’s Human Resource service providers. DoDEA changed from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to the Army Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA).

Through internal controls and prepayment authorizations, overpayments are usually prevented. The Department's overpayments within the agency control under the Commercial Pay – MOCAS program in FY 2024 were mainly attributed to human input error. During the FY 2024 post-payment reviews of the program, it was found that payment terms were entered incorrectly into MOCAS when contract modifications were implemented. These overpayments are classified as within agency control because the contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the payment terms are entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification is received. The contract input team is also responsible for verifying the accuracy of the payment, to include payment terms, prior to release. The Department has several controls in place to prevent overpayments from occurring, including requiring that prior to payment, entitlement technicians complete a review of the contract and supporting documentation.  In addition, a procedure is in place for any payments greater than $1 million to undergo secondary review to ensure entitlements are legal, proper, and correct.  The contract input team also utilizes a daily report to track contracts and modifications received to ensure timely input into the system.

This meant that the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting documentation, such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper and unknown payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024. As a result, the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became arduous and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain, review, and ultimately provide KSD's to substantiate payments.

In the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) (SF1190) and the Travel Order Processing System (TOPS)(DD1614), a DoDEA employee must complete an SF1190 to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  The DoDEA employee must also complete an DD-1614 to apply for Non-TDY Travel. 
Completion of the SF-1190 and the DD-1614 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount for all overseas and travel allowances.  DAPS and TOPS are older systems that do not have the ability to provide Common Access Card (CAC) signatures.  However, DAPS and TOPS are DoDEA systems that have official signature cards on file and can only be accessed with appropriate vetted access and a CAC.  It is important to note that DoDEA employees are being paid correctly and this is just a supporting documentation control finding.

DAPS and TOPS are to be modernized in the coming years and will provide the capability to have CAC signatures on the SF1190 and DD1614.

"DOD","Civilian Pay – Other Defense Organization (ODO)","app4_1","The Department’s unknown payments within the Civilian Pay Other Defense Organization were primarily a result of the lack of sufficient key supporting documentation (KSD) to substantiate whether payments were proper or improper at the time of post-payment reviews. Specifically, with payments related to the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense Health Agency (DHA), the Department was undergoing a consolidation of components at the DHA and the Civilian Humans Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the transition, certain individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed. This meant that the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting documentation, such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper and unknown payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024 who were unfamiliar with the procedure and process of procuring and providing supporting documentation. As a result, the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became arduous and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain, review, and ultimately provide KSD to substantiate payments. Examples of the missing KSDs are travel orders, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report (SF-1190), and Standard Form 50 (SF-50) Notification of Personnel Action to validate alimony garnishments, child support garnishments, market pay validation, location information, living quarters allowance (LQA).

The Department has the internal controls in place to support the reduction of improper payments in the DoD Travel Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted, and the Department is making efforts to ensure those internal controls are followed. For example, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Post-Pay Review & Analysis (PPRA) team is sending monthly reports to all components detailing their improper payment rates and the top causes of improper payments. Regular training is provided to educate the travelers and approvers to help address those top causes and on proper travel pay regulations and procedures. In addition, Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) distributes a monthly newsletter which covers latest travel news, events, and training information. Currently, DTMO is planning to use the newsletter to bring attention to the DFAS PPRA reports and ways to address the issues reported.

Human Capital:
The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the DoD Travel Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  However, as the DoD Travel Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skillsets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.

Information Systems and Other Infrastructure: 
The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the DoD Travel Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  The primary system currently used by the Department to process travel payments is the Defense Travel System (DTS).  DTS received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2022.

The Department has taken various actions to increase the communication and educate the workforce on travel procedures. Top errors are identified by performing reviews of the travel payments throughout the year and focusing the communication and training on those top trending travel pay errors identified by the Defense Financial and Accounting Service (DFAS) Post-Pay Review team. Communication and training efforts include: individual email notifications sent by DFAS to notify individuals making errors, bi-weekly Travel Assistance Center Senior Site calls which cover top travel issues, monthly post pay review reports sent by DFAS to travel pay leadership with information about their current improper payment rate and top improper payment errors, detailed error workbooks explaining each error and allowing for rebuttals sent by DFAS to travel pay managers, Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) newsletters addressing latest travel news, events, and training information, Defense Travel System (DTS) push notifications, and various training events. 

In addition to the lack of training which is contributing to the improper and missing receipt issues in the travel vouchers, the Department recognizes that many of the issues related to receipts are furthered by vendors not offering receipts that satisfy the department's regulations, or the limitations of the current travel management system, DTS. To improve its travel management, the Department is investing into a new travel management system, MyTravel which comes with built in capabilities that should prevent or resolve the improper and missing receipt issues.

Addressing the root causes for the samples determined Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that combined is above the statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is a combination of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions aimed at reducing the likelihood of Technically Improper and Unknown Payment errors occurring during the payment process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that block 25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army Command partners. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review the requirements that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting existing SF 1190s), and will coordinate with Army Command partners appropriately.

A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  Completion of the SF-1190 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount for all overseas allowances.  During the FY2023 audit, the SF-1190 was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found that the SF-1190 did not have consistent signatures and dates on the standard forms. DoDEA is in the process of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be housed on DoDEA's internal ServiceNow network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled signatures and dates.

The Air Force has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper payments in its Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  The Air Force has implemented and/or directly supports the following control monitoring activities to identify and recover overpayments and/or correct under payments:
- The DFAS post-payment reviews in support of PIIA compliance and reporting.
- Entitlement verifications, management notice reconciliations, and reports, such as Basic Allowance for Housing/Overseas Housing Allowance Recertification, Dependency Discrepancy Reconciliation, Flight Pay Verification, Delinquent Pay Authorization, and reconciliation of travel status to mil pay entitlements.
- Pay Record Accessibility: audit the pay records of personnel with military pay system access.
- Self-assessment checklists in military pay, quality assurance, and the resource management checklist for commanders, resource center managers, and resource advisors.
- Metrics in military pay, such as dependency discrepancy to monitor pay affecting mismatches between the personnel and military pay systems.
- Case Management System (CMS) to control complex pay cases and the Customer Service Portal (CSP) to allow them to quantify and better analyze customer service interactions and overpayment recoveries.
Moreover, Military Pay Services, which support the end-to-end delivery of payroll processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2021.

Human Capital:
As a result of methodology changes in the DFAS post-payment reviews, the Air Force will be required to provide additional key supporting documentation in FY 2022.  Consequently, the Air Force must devote more human capital resources to meet Department targets, aggressive timelines, and levels of performance.  As such, the Air Force will baseline these new review requirements in FY 2022 to determine the appropriate level of human capital required to meet this requirement and additional skill sets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.

Information Systems and Other Infrastructure: 
The Air Force has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  However, as technology advances, the Air Force and the Department continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Military Pay through implementation of new integrated pay and personnel processing systems.  The primary system currently used by the Air Force and the Department to process Military Pay is the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS).  The general and application controls of DJMS were included in the scope of the Military Pay Services FY 2021 Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 examination, which received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report.  However, DJMS is a legacy entitlement system requiring manual handoffs and processing.  It will be replaced by the Air Force Integrated Pay and Personnel System (AFIPPS) in the future.  Under AFIPPS, improper payments will be reduced because entitlements will be directly inputted into the Military Pay payroll system by an authorized personnel source thereby eliminating all manual processing.
Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2021.

The Department has internal controls in place to support the reduction of improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the Department has targeted.  As part of the internal control framework for this program, the DFAS Director of R&A Pay has identified and documented known risks associated with the processes for providing pay services to the customers of the Military Retirement program.  Along with identifying these risks by process, the Director of R&A Pay instituted key controls and control activities over pre-review of payments and certifying officer legislation, and developed an internal post-payment review process to mitigate the documented risks.  The Director also tests the controls to ensure their effectiveness and documents the test results.  Moreover, the Military Retirement Fund received an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements in FY 2020. 
Human Capital
Currently, the Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the Department has targeted.  In fact, a goal of the Director of R&A Pay is to reduce their end strength and associated labor dollars.  Part of the goal of the R&A reorganization effort is to create additional efficiencies and unify purpose among teams and across functions.  R&A Pay has positioned itself to support the prevention of improper payments with existing resources.

The Department has internal controls in place to support the reduction of improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the Department has targeted.  As part of the internal control framework for this program, the DFAS Director of R&A Pay has identified and documented known risks associated with the processes for providing pay services to the customers of the Military Retirement program.  Along with identifying these risks by process, the Director of R&A Pay instituted key controls and control activities over pre-review of payments and certifying officer legislation and developed an internal post-payment review process to mitigate the documented risks.  The Director also tests the controls to ensure their effectiveness and documents the test results.  Moreover, the Military Retirement Fund is expected to receive an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements in FY 2022. 

Human Capital:
Currently, the Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the Department has targeted.  With the increased sample size for the upcoming fiscal year to improve reliability of estimates, R&A’s Internal Controls team will ensure human capital is sufficient to keep up. Increasing sample size will require additional reviews to validate ESS’s post review results and ensure timely corrective actions made with the identification of improper payments.

Information Systems and Other Infrastructure: 
The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the Department has targeted.  Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department, projected unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2022.

The Navy has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.

"DOL","Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment Insurance","cyp4_1","The UI program is a unique federal-state partnership based on Federal law but administered through individual state laws by 53 state UI agencies. States vary in their information technology systems, level of automation, staffing capacity, and methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and recovery of improper payments and fraud. Additionally, no two states' written laws, regulations, and policies specifying eligibility conditions are identical, and differences in these conditions influence the potential for error and improper payments. Two states could have identical laws but may interpret them quite differently. States with stringent or complex provisions tend to have higher improper payment rates than
those with simpler, more straightforward provisions.

Furthermore, Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act requires UI payments to be made “when due” and, once a person is determined eligible, this law  prohibits states from suspending payments until an official determination has been made that payments are no longer due. This statutory factor requires states to make payments that may later be determined as improper as a result of obtaining new information. For good policy reasons, states must continue paying benefits until due process occurs (notice and an opportunity for a hearing is provided before benefit payments are stopped). This UI program structural feature is a primary driver for top root causes of UI improper payments.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

"DOT","Federal Highway Administration Highway Planning and Construction","cyp4_1","The Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Highway Planning and Construction program is not administered at the Federal level and overpayments are outside of FHWA control when grant recipients make administrative errors. The program supports States and Local Public Agencies (LPA) in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s highway system and various federally and tribal owned lands. FHWA funds provide the financial resources and mechanism to perform these activities. Tax dollars are allocated and distributed by FHWA directly to the State DOTs, as a direct-recipient, or LPAs, as sub-recipients, for eligible activities. In turn, the State DOTs provide oversight of LPA projects and ensure that local agencies that receive and deliver federally funded projects comply with Federal and State requirements.

In recognition of FHWA’s assignment of responsibilities to the State DOTs, Congress requires that a formal written agreement be established between FWHA and each State DOT regarding the use of federal funds. The State DOT is expected to exercise judgments similar to FHWA based on Federal laws, regulations, and policies. These responsibilities provide assurance that approval actions will be performed in accordance with State policies, practices and standards and all requirements of federal law.

Two important characteristics of FHWA Highway Planning and Construction financial assistance are that it is both a reimbursable and a matching program. Reimbursable means that FHWA pays grantees and
 
subrecipients the actual eligible expenses incurred. Money is not provided in advance, so a State DOT or LPA must initially finance the project and request reimbursement. A matching program means that the Federal funds are matched with State or local resources to cover the total project cost. Thus, State DOTs and LPAs are responsible for the accuracy of their reimbursement requests in accordance with applicable Federal and State requirements.

In summary, much of the authority for administering the FHWA financial assistance falls to the State DOTs, which are responsible for providing oversight and to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements including the accuracy of payment requests.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

During the pandemic, states transitioned experienced staff from their normal duties to assist with the unprecedented claims volume to operate the regular UI programs as well as implementing and administering the temporary pandemic UI programs.

For example, hotel receipts provided did not have zero balance indicated, and often rental car and airline reservation or agreements were provided in place of receipts or invoices. Upon further analysis, it was discovered that many travelers and/or approving officials did not: 
a.	Fully understand, implement or enforce the requirements for a valid receipt as defined by the DOD FMR, and 
b.	Correctly load their reservation document or rental car agreement rather than their official invoice for airfare and rental cars.  It was also discovered many approving officials were not

d.	Complete the requirements for the justification statement associated with vocal orders issued when the DTS is created after the fact; therefore, the statements in DTS were missing who issued the order and when to fully substantiate the authorization in DTS.

ETA uses performance measures to evaluate states’ UI operations and has established an FY 2025 Agency Priority Goal to reduce the UI improper payment rate. States are also required to report illegal/fraudulent activity to the DOL-OIG (see UIPL No. 04-17). ETA and the UI Integrity Center support states to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments and combat fraud. ETA requires states to conduct overpayment detection and recovery activities, and BAM units conduct investigations to assess payment accuracy. ETA uses BAM improper payment data to assess UI program risks and develop mitigation strategies. 

Additionally, the Department completely aligned its UI fraud risk management activities with the leading practices in GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework. The UI program has internal controls in place and continues to enhance these resources to deter improper payments and fraud. ETA’s UI Integrity Strategic Plan addresses the top root causes of improper payments and outlines integrity actions and antifraud strategies to support states in reducing improper payments and mitigating fraud risks.

Furthermore, development, delivery, and/or implementation of these initiatives by managers and states is outlined in ETA’s annual Agency Management Plan. Annual performance standards for managers reference strategies and include the completion of the activities/milestones below:

•	SQSP process requires states to submit IAPs to identify state-specific root causes, strategies to address each root cause, and CAPs if the improper payment rate is above 10%.

•	Provide annual funding and direction, and partner with the UI Integrity Center to provide tools, training, and technical assistance to implement innovative strategies to prevent, detect and reduce improper payments and fraud.

•	Ensure states conduct annual the BAM survey to measure improper payments and root causes. ETA reviews BAM state data for validity, analyzes trends, and makes data available at: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/unemployment-insurance-payment-accuracy/data. 
 
•	Monitor progress on the performance measures that states must meet.

•	States failing to meet performance criteria are required to submit annual CAPs that include strategies to improve state performance.

"DOL","Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment Insurance","cyp4_1","The UI program is a unique federal-state partnership based on Federal law but administered through individual state laws by 53 state UI agencies. States vary in their information technology (IT) systems, level of automation, staffing capacity, and methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and recovery of improper payments and fraud. Additionally, no two states' written laws, regulations, and policies specifying eligibility conditions are identical, and differences in these conditions influence the potential for error and improper payments. Two states could have identical laws but may interpret them quite differently. States with stringent or complex provisions tend to have higher improper payment rates than those with simpler, more straightforward provisions.

Furthermore, Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (SSA) requires UI payments to be made “when due” and, once a person is determined eligible, this law prohibits states from suspending payments until an official determination has been made that payments are no longer due. This statutory factor requires states to make payments that may later be determined as improper as a result of obtaining new information. For good policy reasons, states must continue paying benefits until due process occurs (notice and an opportunity for a hearing is provided before benefit payments are stopped). This UI program structural feature is a primary driver for top root causes of UI improper payments.  Moreover, unlike many other benefit programs, eligibility for UI benefits is determined on a weekly basis.  There are more opportunities to make errors and for improper payments to be created.

The program supports States and Local Public Agencies (LPA) in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s highway system and various federally and tribal owned lands. FHWA funds provides the financial resources and mechanism to perform these activities. Tax dollars are allocated and distributed by FHWA directly to the State DOTs, as a direct-recipient, or LPAs, as sub-recipients, for eligible activities. In turn, the State DOTs provide oversight of LPA projects and ensure that local agencies that receive and deliver federally funded projects comply with Federal and State requirements.

In recognition of FHWA’s assignment of responsibilities to the State DOTs, Congress requires that a formal written agreement be established between FWHA and each State DOT regarding the use of federal funds. The State DOT, acting on behalf of FHWA, is expected to exercise judgments similar to FHWA based on Federal laws, regulations, and policies. These responsibilities provide assurance that approval actions will be performed in accordance with State policies, practices and standards and all requirements of federal law.

Two important characteristics of FHWA Highway Planning and Construction financial assistance are that it is both a reimbursable and a matching program. Reimbursable means that FHWA pays grantees and subrecipients the actual eligible expenses incurred. Money is not provided in advance, so a State DOT or LPA must initially finance the project and request reimbursement. A matching program means that the Federal funds are matched with State or local resources to cover the total project cost. Thus, State DOTs and LPAs are responsible for the accuracy of their reimbursement requests in accordance applicable Federal and State requirements.

In summary, much of the authority for administering the FHWA financial assistance falls to the State DOTs, which are responsible for providing oversight and to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements including the accuracy of payment requests.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

A contributing cause of the improper and unknown payments calculated for the reporting period for the program was the result of a number of states failing to perform or document performance of key data cross-matches. Training was identified as one of the actions taken to address improper and unknown payments. Through training opportunities such as ETA webinars that discussed its guidance, training and instructions on using tools like the Integrity Data Hub and various crossmatches, as well as individual technical assistance from regional offices, states were able to improve identity verification activity. This improvement directly impacts a state’s ability to ensure the social security numbers used in the UI claims process by UI applicants, in fact belong to these applicants. In doing so, states are able to reduce improper and unknown payments.
Additionally, the use of cross enterprise sharing helps states to gain access to a more comprehensive pool of data that can assist as they attempt to verify the identity to UI applicants in various categories such as, across agencies or across states. This kind of access broadens the reach of the state verification process and can help in its efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments due to identity.

To effectively prevent IPs and UPs from occurring, FSA evaluates the root causes of IPs and UPs identified. This root cause analysis is used to help formulate effective correction actions and prioritize efforts to prevent IPs and UPs from occurring. For example, FSA's most impactful root cause over the last five years for total IP in aggregate for all programs has been improper payments due to misreported income. FSA has invested significant resources and worked cross-agency with the IRS to implement the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from the IRS. Once implemented, this corrective action will eliminate misreported income on the FAFSA.

At the agency-level, FTA’s Chief Financial Officer oversees FTA’s Office of Budget and Policy which administers the implementation of the Administration’s PIIA requirements. This office develops improper payment reduction targets, implements corrective actions, and coordinates the recapture of improper payments identified during PIIA reviews. The Office of Budget and Policy works with FTA oversight and regional offices to hold recipients accountable on the closure of corrective actions associated with improper payment remediation plans.

For FTA, the grant development stage, before award and obligation of Federal funds, is critical to program and payment integrity. During this stage, FTA personnel verify that only eligible and allowable activities are included in the grant. After grant award and obligation of FTA funds, the recipient certifies compliance with applicable Federal requirements annually, compliance with requirements is confirmed via FTA’s oversight processes, and FTA regional offices track and monitor deficiencies to ensure the recipient implements corrective action. 

FTA manages several oversight programs covering transit safety, its many grant programs, more than 1,000 grantees, and thousands of projects, including major capital projects over $1 billion, as well as mid-size and smaller projects. FTA’s Office of Program Oversight develops and implements a comprehensive national oversight program to ensure that funding recipients remain compliant with the requirements of assistance programs. To foster stewardship of federal funds, the office institutes oversight performance metrics, analyzes nationwide recipient compliance trends, and develops and implements technical assistance and training tools and events based on grantee oversight trend analysis. Types of oversight reviews include: Triennial Reviews (mandated compliance reviews); State Management Reviews; Procurement System Reviews; and Financial Management Oversight Reviews.

To effectively prevent IPs and UPs from occurring, FSA evaluates the root causes of IPs and UPs identified. This root cause analysis is used to help formulate effective correction actions and prioritize efforts to prevent IPs and UPs from occurring. For example, FSA's most impactful root cause over the last five years for total IP in aggregate across all programs has been improper payments due to misreported income. FSA has invested significant resources and worked cross-agency with the IRS to implement the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from the IRS. Significant work has been accomplished, and once fully implemented in FY 2025, this corrective action is expected to significantly reduce misreported income on the FAFSA.

FSA relies on the expertise of its subject matter experts and owners of the corrective actions to identify any changes for its corrective actions. FSA monitors the status of the corrective actions through quarterly outreach to corrective action owners and collects closure evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and progress of each individual mitigation strategy. This process informs whether the corrective action can be refined, intensified, expanded, or should be discontinued or replaced.

The team is also leveraging data analytics to improve competitive bidding training and enhance compliance by adding content regarding the minimum 28 day waiting period to select service providers, the factors for assessing responsive bids, and document retention. 

The Schools and Libraries team is also adding additional preventative controls to proactively identify and prevent the types of invoicing errors identified in the PQA assessments from re-occurring in the future, and providing enhanced training regarding the invoicing process.  To further address invoicing-related issues, USAC is transitioning the Schools and Libraries program invoicing from the current SL legacy systems to EPC, which is expected to help with identifying invoicing issues before disbursements are issued.

"HUD","Public and Indian Housing - Rental Housing Assistance Program - Tenant Based Rental Assistance - Section 8 - Housing Certificate Fund & Tenant Based Rental Assistance","rac3","During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned improvements to establish effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) program. The goal is to prevent and detect improper payments, as outlined in the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan. Currently, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public housing agenciey’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD evaluated existing reports for estimating improper payment rates but found they did not meet the stringent requirements set by the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). Additionally, these reports could not generate reliable error estimates with sufficient precision to cover the entire payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.

Looking ahead to FY 2025 and beyond, and as funding is available, HUD will continue implementing the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and will explore testing methods for sub-populations within the TBRA portfolio. By exploring other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit from efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through the following initiatives:

•The Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) is set to significantly improve the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. It will modernize how HUD records monthly HCV performance and automate cash management transactions as well as financial reporting. eVMS will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of housing assistance payments (HAPs), thereby reducing prepaid expenses and accounts payables. This will be achieved by using real-time family-level data that PHAs submit to HUD via the HUD-50058 through IMS PIC. The system will also perform month-to-month reconciliations for retroactive adjustments due to annual income certifications or changes in family composition. Moreover, eVMS will calculate and track administrative fees across all voucher programs, simplifying decision-making for PHAs regarding voucher issuance and other program needs by providing daily online views of PHA funding balances. Overall, eVMS will automate cash management payments and reconciliations, streamline reporting for HUD’s financials, and generate data to test elements within payee and eligibility tiers.

•HUD is also advancing one key project, a beta version of the Enhanced EIV tool, which uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to identify income trends and changes. The system improvements will strengthen preventative controls at the time of initial applications and renewals, with a focus on eligibility. The Enhanced EIV tool will help identify income discrepancies during tenant applications and renewals, providing PHAs with immediate access to income data reported by other partners. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk of improper payments resulting from income discrepancies. By leveraging both current and historical data alongside predictive analytics, HUD will be able to pinpoint trends and forecasts concerning family income. The enhancements will eventually expand to involve multiple stakeholders, including all housing authorities. The Enhanced EIV tool will offer a comprehensive view across the department for all PHAs, ensuring that accurate tenant-level information is used for determining Voucher Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) eligibility. This holistic perspective will aid in identifying discrepancies between tenant-reported income and data from other partners and federal agencies, such as the National Database of New Hires from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

These initiatives reflect HUD's commitment to enhancing the integrity and efficiency of the TBRA program, ultimately benefiting the communities we serve and demonstrating a strong commitment to payment integrity.

"SSA","Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)","app1_1","To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations, reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In December 2023, CCE Announcements became available.  Now, when updates are made within CCE, the technicians receive a brief message the first time they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related to CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements, we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation, which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error and reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional application.  We also plan to release our first retirement benefit application within CCE.  We will test it in a few field offices before a national release.  

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process, increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted product is comprised of four separate workstreams:  Work CDR, Medical CDR, Electronic Disability Collect System (EDCS), and CDRs Modernization, across several component business and systems sponsors.  In FY 2023, CDR product released the i454 which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician's process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In FY 2024, we released Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the EDCS that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.  We made the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We are currently developing a modernized replacement of eWork which will be integrated into the existing EDCS application.  The eWork replacement will reinforce policy and intuitively drive best practices to reduce improper payments.  In FY 2024 we made technical releases for the eWork replacement.  We will release the minimum viable product to technicians in tandem with retiring eWork by the end of FY 2025.  Subsequent releases will be scheduled for FY 2026 if funding permits.  

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In FY 2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  In February 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all field offices and workload support units.  In March 2024, an additional task called External Tasks became available.  External Tasks provides technicians the ability to open commonly used applications directly from TED.  As of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications available via TED.  We plan to continue to enhance the customer composite by bringing in and displaying more customer information from other systems.  Releases to enhance existing functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We are also working on plans to expand to other user groups, such as the field and regional offices including Appellate Operations.  Integration of the technician facing portion of Visitor Intake Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.  

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In FY 2021, we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, several BOTs have been created and placed into production.  In FY 2024, we added a BOT utilized by headquarters analysts, that helped reduce stale Registration, Appointment and Services for Representatives (RASR) appointments.  Technicians are able to use the BOT to review and terminate stale appointments in the RASR database.  Use of BOTs reduces keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In FY 2025, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and identify opportunities to automate computations and inputs to reduce input errors.  We are making a long-term investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes and eliminate manual actions.  

To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production.  In September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded the eSignature/Upload Documents service to all field offices and workload support units nationwide.  This release allows customers to access the service with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also, in March 2024, eSignature/Upload Documents became available to all Field Offices and Workload Support Units Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months, we began releasing mobile friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms for customer completion.  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated 10-day follow up reminder and confirmation of successful submission emails to enhance communication with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated the service with my Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text communications.  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms for a mobile friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and evidence types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social Security and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including Upload Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand to 3rd party forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional support to our mutual customers.","[app1_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Automation corrective action(s) PLANNED.

We directly leverage our existing internal control environment and assurance processes to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating effectively.

As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.

We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.

Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on having the necessary trained staff to do the work.   For the most part, our employees who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and other mission-critical work.

Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  

We initiated our IT Modernization Plan, in fiscal year (FY) 2018 to improve our service to the public.  We will advance our IT infrastructure with 21st century technology and implement the technical flexibility necessary to adapt to future demands.  In FY 2020, we increased the scope to include adding online services, improving and expanding automated services available through our National 800 Number, and providing additional self-service and express services in our field offices.  To achieve our modernization goals, we are investing $863 million over 5 years, including the $415 million that Congress provided in dedicated IT modernization funding in FYs 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Other Infrastructure:  We emphasize the importance of information security through continual operational refinement and the maturation of security components that exceed the standards set forth by Government regulations.  In FY 2021, we continued to align our agency cybersecurity priorities with agency strategic objectives and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to identify, detect, and stop fraudulent transactions before they occur.  Continued alignment with the CSF will infuse practices from Federal initiatives including the President’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) High Value Asset program, and DHS’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program.  We will continue to streamline and modernize the existing Comprehensive Integrity Review Program business process.

For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we are addressing the challenge of reliance on self-reporting by promoting timely wage reporting and issuing reminders on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to utilize an automated information exchange with commercial payroll data providers to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages.  This exchange is referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange.

We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor the status of corrective actions through bi-monthly meetings and quarterly senior executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that will have the most significant impact to the detection and prevention of improper payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments, we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.

In fiscal year 2024 we completed our annual updates that are part of the monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of completed corrective actions on the leading causes of improper payments.

To determine whether a beneficiary meets the Marital Status eligibility criteria, we must evaluate a beneficiary’s state of being unmarried, married, divorced, or widowed.  Entitlement to some categories of benefits is impacted by the beneficiary’s marital status, so we rely on beneficiaries to report changes in their marital status.

In February 2024, we issued reminders on Social Security TV in field office reception areas to report relationship changes as it may affect their Social Security payments.  In August 2024, we published a blog about the importance of reporting changes.  The article provided examples of life changes that need to be reported to Social Security to avoid overpayments.  In July and August 2024, we used our social media channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we are working to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of our notices and communications can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain information.  We published several blogs and Social Security TV slides in field office waiting areas on the importance of reporting relationship changes to us for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance beneficiaries to improve the responsiveness of beneficiaries and recipients in self-reporting information that impacts benefit payments.  We are currently updating the Work Activity Report (SSA-821), to make it more understandable and more likely to be completed by applicants and beneficiaries.  We use form SSA-821 to collect information about applicant and beneficiary’s work, applicable work incentives, and non-work-related pay.  It allows us to make accurate decisions as to whether beneficiaries are performing Substantial Gainful Activity.  In addition, we developed a Work Incentive Notice pilot for increasing completion of the Work Activity Report by sending beneficiaries pre-notices that incorporate behaviorally informed language to encourage completion of these reports.  In addition, throughout 2024 we reviewed new and revised agency notices for both clear messaging and plain language.  We will need to obtain Office of Management and Budget clearance for Form SSA-821 prior to implementation.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the quality and understandability of our communications.  We will continue to inform and remind beneficiaries about reporting responsibilities.  We will also continue to review overpayment-related notice review requests (both new and revised language) to make sure it is in plain language that people can read and understand.","[app2_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Behavioral/Psych Influence corrective action(s) PLANNED.

We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data.  Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR).  As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process.  We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our death data.  

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment Compensation Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), provides coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of FECA benefits can offset Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits.  We have agreed with DOL to move forward with our request for DOL FECA data.  We are working to finalize the agreement for DOL to provide FECA payment data to assist us in our offset requirements.  In December 2023, the agency established an eCOMP system Memorandum of Understanding with DOL to obtain FECA benefits to allow the agency to offset OASDI benefits and prevent or reduce overpayments.  Technicians can complete an ad hoc query in eCOMP to obtain FECA data, the FECA payment status, dates, amounts and it is immediately available to the technician via the eCOMP portal.  In April 2024, we provided reminders on how to process initial claims with workers compensation lump-sum settlement allegations.  We expect the exchange to be completed in FY 2025.  

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements and allow us to respond to public concerns from the NPRM public comment period.","[app5_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Cross Enterprise Sharing corrective action(s) PLANNED.

"SSA","Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)","app6_1","To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross-agency work group to review all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy, data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether additional mitigation activities are necessary.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  In FY 2023, there was an increase in improper payments related to WEP, but overall, since FY 2017, there has been a significant reduction in improper payments related to WEP and GPO.  In March 2024, we provided detailed information to technicians regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely, when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  In FY 2024, we developed a new policy to address multiple non-covered pensions distributed or terminated at different periods of time.  This will provide a consistent national policy.  We plan to publish the policy in FY 2025.","[app6_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Audit corrective action(s) PLANNED. (Unit Free-Text)","2024"

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Additional Child Tax Credit","rap6","The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance and reduce erroneous payments. 

For  FY 2021 , the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget submission:

Provide the IRS with greater flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.

Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence in the tax system.

For  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal, as well as the following additional proposal:

Increase penalties on ghost preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer. The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","app1_1","To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations, reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023 there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In FY 2024, we will release several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining regions in FY 2024.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to all field offices in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that can be uploaded and signed electronically.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","app2_1","To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we inform Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients and representative payees about their reporting responsibilities through various methods:  during interviews, with application and redetermination forms, in some award and post-eligibility notices, in check envelope enclosures, and in a booklet that accompanies award notices.  Our annual Cost of Living Adjustment notices include reminders about reporting changes that could affect payments and eligibility.  In September 2013, we implemented an automated SSI wage reporting reminder for individuals who sign up to receive a monthly email or text message to report wages for the prior month.  We promote use of our online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with training videos including information about the importance of creating a my Social Security account; how to submit wages using myWR, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting, or SSI Telephone Wage Reporting; who can report; and reminders on reporting responsibilities.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we published social media posts on Facebook and X sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn why it is important to report wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates reminding them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring we have current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The blog provides examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving a Better Life Experience accounts.  In July 2024, we published a blog about the agency’s commitment to improve timely delivery of payments to SSI recipients and our progress addressing underpayments.  In August 2024, we published a blog that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting life changes to Social Security.  The blog provides examples of life changes that need to be reported to avoid overpayments, how to report these changes, and where to obtain more information.  In July and August of 2024, we used our social media channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media channels to post reminders for our recipients about the importance of promptly reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate payments and avoid overpayments.  These posts also inform recipients how we are required by law to adjust payments or recover debts when people receive payments they are not entitled to.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we are working to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of our notices and communications can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain information.  We updated a blog for “Social Security Matters” that focuses on the importance of Supplemental Security Income recipients reporting their financial accounts and any changes related to financial accounts to us.  In an effort to increase responsiveness of beneficiaries and recipients in self-reporting information that impacts payments, we used behavioral insights methods to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the blog.  Also, we are currently updating the Work Activity Report (SSA-821) to make it more understandable and more likely to be completed by applicants.  In addition, throughout 2024 we reviewed new and revised agency notices for both clear messaging and plain language.  We will need to obtain Office of Management and Budget clearance for Form SSA-821 prior to implementation.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the quality and understandability of our communications.  We will continue to inform and remind recipients about reporting responsibilities.  We will also continue to review overpayment-related notice review requests (both new and revised language) to make sure it is in plain language that people can read and understand.","[app2_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Behavioral/Psych Influence corrective action(s) PLANNED.

Our existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating effectively.

As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.

We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.

Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on having the necessary trained staff to do the work.   For the most part, our employees who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and other mission-critical work.

Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure to serve the public and safeguard our programs.

We initiated our IT Modernization Plan in fiscal year (FY) 2018 to improve our service to the public.  Over the past decade, we have phased out many of our older computer systems and aligned our IT infrastructure with industry and government-wide standards, while continuing to meet the evolving needs of our customers.  In FY 2020, we increased the scope to include building online services, improving and expanding automated services available through our National 800 Number, and providing additional self-service and express services in our field offices.  To achieve our modernization goals, we are investing $863 million over 5 years, including the $415 million that Congress provided in dedicated IT modernization funding in FYs 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.

In FY 2022, we plan to close out our IT modernization efforts outlined in the IT Modernization Plan.  We will continue to build upon our modernization efforts with a focus on digital modernization and efforts that enable technology to provide tangible benefits to our customers.

Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act.

Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.","[rap5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences elaborating on whether the agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate (i.e., a level below which further expenditures to reduce improper payments would cost more than the amount those expenditures would save in prevented or recovered improper payments).

The regulatory structure of the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), to include the lack of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of AOTC improper payments. Specifically, at the time of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily authenticate eligibility i.e., whether the dependent/student in fact qualifies, meeting the many nuances of the qualifying education expenses. This is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer misreporting of eligibility requirements, such as qualifying tuition expenses, Adjusted Gross Income, filing status, deductions, exemptions, and credits. Finally, each year there are many taxpayers who receive AOTC for the first time, who have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including AOTC, prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a refund.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

(2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – 
The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers. First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification
Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify the
Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","cyp4_1","Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayments outside the agency’s control occur when the data or information needed does not exist and because of our inability to access data or information needed.  For the root cause data or information needed does not exist, overpayments occur because there is no database or dataset that currently exists where we can check eligibility prior to making the payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s income, which includes support and maintenance provided in kind.  This type of income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month as household expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source we can use to verify these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses, composition, and contributions accurately and timely.

For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.  Although we explicitly inform all individuals of their reporting requirements during the application process and within every award letter, pamphlets periodically sent to recipients, and standard language in most official agency correspondence, recipients and representative payees may fail to report or may not report changes in time to prevent an improper payment.

SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  We remain committed to simplifying the SSI program, and we are exploring ways to do this in an equitable manner.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","rnp3","For the root cause data or information needed does not exist, overpayments occur because there is no database or dataset that currently exists where we can check eligibility prior to making the payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s income, which includes support and maintenance provided in kind.  This type of income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month as household expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source we can use to verify these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses, composition, and contributions accurately and timely.  However, as of September 30, 2024, we are no longer counting food as income when we figure Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, and we expanded the rental subsidy policy which may increase the amount some people are eligible to receive.  Additionally, we expanded the definition of a public assistance household to include households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments and households where at least one household member other than the recipient or applicant receives public assistance.  These three updates are part of SSI regulation simplification.

For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.

For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure to access data, our corrective actions and strategies fall within several high-level categories such as automation, business process improvement (including program and policy simplification), and training to improve accuracy.

We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor the status of corrective actions through bi-monthly meetings and quarterly senior executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that will have the most significant impact on the detection and prevention of improper payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments, we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.

In fiscal year (FY) 2024, we completed evaluations on two of our Improper Payments Alignment Strategies.  Additionally, in FY 2024, we completed our annual updates that are part of monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of completed corrective actions on the leading causes in improper payments.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore cost-effective corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we continue to note that the complexity of our SSI program makes it extremely difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular corrective action.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rap6","The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance and reduce erroneous payments. 

For  FY 2021 , the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget submission:

Provide the IRS with greater flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.

Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence in the tax system.

For  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal, as well as the following additional proposal:

Increase penalties on ghost preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer. The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rnp3","The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Additional Child Tax Credit","app5_1","The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements with the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to access critical information that aids in validating eligibility for the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). This data-sharing involves the exchange of key data points, such as income verification, household composition and income limits and the eligibility to claim certain dependents. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements for the ACTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing allows the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as misreported income or invalid dependent claims, and prevent improper payments during the return processing stage. Another root cause of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information, taxpayers may inaccurately claim the ACTC due to misunderstanding income limits or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from OCSE and SSA, the IRS can verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given the lack of a pre-approval process for these credits. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.","[app5_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Cross Enterprise Sharing corrective action(s) PLANNED.

1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  

2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit","rnp3","The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental root cause of RTC improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there is an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing with many nuances); (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayers who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the IRS's information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility rules and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies, and outreach/education efforts aid the IRS in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

The changes to the CDCTC were temporary, applying only to TY 2021. The short-term nature of this program limits the IRS’s ability to calculate improper payment estimates. To generate an improper payment estimate, the IRS needs to conduct comprehensive audits over a large sample of tax returns, requiring at least three years’ worth of data to ensure accuracy.

Accordingly, the credit has no basis for improper payment estimates. In August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources.

We demonstrate a commitment to sound management practices.  To ensure stewardship and the efficient administration of our programs, we have established performance measures in our Annual Performance Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2023–2024 to track our progress.  Under Strategic Objective 3.1 – Improve the Accuracy and Administration of our Programs, there are two performance measures directly related to reduction of improper payments:

3.1a - Improve the integrity of the Supplemental Security Income program by focusing our efforts on reducing overpayments 

3.1b - Maintain a high payment accuracy rate by reducing overpayments, in the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program

Under our annual Performance Accountability and Communication System, all agency managers have a critical element called “Manages Performance.”  This element includes two performance standards related to preventing and reducing improper payments:  establishes and maintains suitable internal controls to prevent improper payments; and uses established guidelines to reduce and recover improper payments.

We assess managers throughout the agency on these standards each year and hold them accountable for meeting improper payment reduction targets.  Each agency component adds expectations that are more detailed for their positions describing what is expected for meeting these performance standards.

Senior Executive performance plans must clearly align with organizational goals and objectives under the Results Driven Critical Element.  Performance levels in the performance requirements must reflect agency targets.

We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), consisting of senior executive membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.  The Deputy Commissioner of the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight (OARO) serves as the executive chair for the IPOB.  To further our focus on reducing improper payments, in FY 2019, we established an Improper Payments Prevention Team now referred to as the Improper Payments Prevention Branch, in OARO.  The team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate the root causes of improper payments.  As part of our IPAS, we will evaluate the effectiveness of each planned or ongoing mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we will determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies, as needed.  IPOB is responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all improper payment initiatives.

We have a strong internal control environment that has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  We directly leverage our existing internal control environment and assurance processes to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating effectively.

As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.

The effective internal controls we incorporate into our business processes and financial management systems, as well as the program integrity efforts, support our Commissioner’s annual assurance statement to the President and Congress.

In April 2019, we established the Enterprise Fraud Risk Management (EFRM) program to systematically assess fraud risks across our major programmatic and administrative areas.  Through our EFRM program we have conducted multiple fraud risk assessments on key areas such as Disability, Electronic Services, Administrative Services, and the Representative Payee program.  After each fraud risk assessment, our senior executives review each fraud risk and determine whether our controls are effective or whether we need to develop additional controls to further reduce the risk.  For each risk designated as “reduce” by our executives, we develop additional mitigation strategies to further prevent or detect the fraud.  The risk response and the designated mitigation strategies form the basis of the fraud risk profile for each fraud area.

We completed a maintenance fraud risk assessment of Agency’s Administrative Services during FY 2024 and continued the reassessment of the disability fraud risk profile, consistent with the Government Accountability Office guidance, to reassess fraud risk profiles on a three-year cycle.  We also finalized the Fraud Risk Profiles for the Enumeration program at the end of calendar year 2023.

For recovery of overpayments, effective March 25, 2024, we changed existing policy and procedure for recovering OASDI overpayments.  Policy has been to default to full benefit withholding.  However, with the change, we began applying a default of 10 percent withholding rate, or $10 per month, whichever is more, to an overpaid individual.  There will be limited exceptions to this change, such as when an overpayment resulted from fraud.

Additionally, when negotiating a rate of overpayment recovery, we traditionally required documentation of income and expenses for repayment timeframes that extended beyond 36 months.  In February 2024, we changed our policy to extend this timeframe to 60 months and reduced the burden on our beneficiaries to provide additional financial and resource information.","[rnp4]Provide a minimum of 6-8 sentences describing the steps taken to ensure that executive managers, programs, and where appropriate, States and local governments are held accountable through annual performance appraisal criteria for meeting applicable reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and recovering overpayments.

Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rap5","To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5 billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment. If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We further support the reporting of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.","[rap5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences elaborating on whether the agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate (i.e., a level below which further expenditures to reduce improper payments would cost more than the amount those expenditures would save in prevented or recovered improper payments).

The purpose of AFI is to identify excess resources in financial accounts, which are a leading cause of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program uses an electronic process with participating financial institutions to verify bank account balances and detect undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks.  We will be evaluating the benefit to running AFI between the SSI initial application and subsequent eligibility redeterminations, based on an Office of the Inspector General recommendation.  In March 2023, we released Policy in Focus training and issued a frontline broadcast to remind technicians of AFI and SSI financial accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account Verification Reminders and issued a frontline broadcast to ensure that technicians are reviewing the financial account pages in the SSI claims path for accuracy before adjudicating an event.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  For FY 2023 we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our death data.

To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the United States Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  Based on NCOA data analysis, we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating the notices to inform SSI recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding their living situation.

To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an information exchange with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We have completed several phases of pre-implementation development and are drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations for the PIE process.  We will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after the final rule (regulation) is established.  We will perform ongoing assessments while working towards full implementation.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rap6","The IRS has proposed various legislative changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget submission: 

A. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  

B. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. 

These statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

These trainings are posted on the Agency’s Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs internal training website and available to all Farm Service Agency employees. 
An Acreage reporting review is currently underway for fiscal year 2022 to help determine the root cause(s) for administrative errors, including late-filed deficiencies.  Farm Service Agency plans to utilize the review results to establish strategies that will improve program processes and establish accountability measures for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal year 2023. 
Refresher trainings will be developed to specifically address common fiscal year 2022 Payment Integrity Information Act findings across programs, to include agency representative approval procedures, acceptable producer and affiliate filing requirements, as well as County Committee redelegations of authority for approval of documents. 
A system is being developed for District Directors to report their required reviews on the Livestock Forage Disaster Program SharePoint site which would improve oversight, particularly to improve errors involving the manual entries of carrying capacities and ensuring acreage reporting was on file properly.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rnp3","The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent
the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a
disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.

The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available. Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies or reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations. The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims.  Therefore, legislative changes are the most effective means of addressing the causes of these improper payments.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Refundable Premium Assistance Tax Credit","rnp3","The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent
the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a
disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs
counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.

The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available. Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies or reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations. The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims. Therefore, legislative changes are the most effective means of addressing the causes of these improper payments.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

SBA does not make loans directly to borrowers:  SBA provides a guaranty to a lender which makes the loan to a borrower. SBA delegates authority to certain lenders to process, close, service, and liquidate certain 7(a) loans without prior SBA review. Approximately 80 percent of 7(a) loans are approved by lenders under their delegated authority. At the time of loan approval, no monies are disbursed. Improper payments identified during loan review result in no monetary loss to the government. During the loan guaranty approval review process, the SBA reviews the 7(a) loan for calculation accuracy to ensure lenders issued the 7(a) loans to eligible borrowers and to ensure loans are made within statutory, regulatory, and SBA issued guidelines.   

In two of the three loans in the sample identified with improper payments, the lender failed to document or determine adequate debt service coverage, based on SOP requirements. In the remaining loan identified as an improper payment, the lender failed to meet loan refinancing requirements as stated in the SOP. 

. 7(a) loans are reviewed at the time of approval; these loans are generally made to the right recipient for the right amount, but the approval process failed to follow all statutes and regulation. In these cases there is no amount that needs to be recovered. However, because the lender failed to adhere to all applicable statutes, the guaranty is considered technically improper.

"USDA","Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP)","rap5","Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Additional Child Tax Credit","cyp4_1","The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory structure of the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), to include the lack of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of ACTC improper payments. Specifically, at the time of filing/payment the IRS cannot readily authenticate eligibility for the credit, i.e., whether a claimed child in fact qualifies, meeting the many nuances of the Age, Relationship, Residency and Joint Return Tests. This is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Finally,  each year there are many taxpayers who claim and receive ACTC for the first time, who have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including ACTC, prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a refund.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Additional Child Tax Credit","rap5","To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5 billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment. If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. 

As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections.

Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved audit selection filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.","[app4_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Change Process corrective action(s) PLANNED.

"USDA","Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP)","rap5","Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

We have proposed various legislative changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the following proposals: 

1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  

2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. 

These statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit","rnp3","The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.

The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available. Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management
deficiencies or reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations. The IRS
annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims. Therefore, legislative changes are the most effective means of addressing the causes of these improper payments.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

"USDA","Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP)","rap5","Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to modify software to incorporate farm record data to properly identify owners, operators, and other tenants and other cross checks to alert County office staff of the need for special processing. Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills.  Estimated funding requirements for system enhancement is $2 million.","[cyp2_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the Overpayments are Within the agency control.

This data-sharing involves the exchange of key data points, such as income thresholds and enrollment in a qualified health plan. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements for the PTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing allows the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as the taxpayer not being in a qualified health plan and prevent improper payments during the return processing stage. An additional root cause of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs), in addition to data needed does not exist and inability to access data, is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information, taxpayers may inaccurately claim the PTC due to misunderstanding income limits or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from CMS, the IRS can verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given the lack of a pre-approval process for these credits.","[app5_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Cross Enterprise Sharing corrective action(s) PLANNED.

If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial  loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections.

1.	New software to process ECP cost share applications and payments more efficiently and to reduce errors is essential to improve program delivery.  A project development schedule has been designed; however, implementation will be based on the Agency IT budget availability and the completion of its current IT priority list.  

2.  FSA has planned to implement the ECP district director review process to the new FSA Internal Review Document and Tracking System (IRDTS) to ensure reviews are being completed timely and results are monitored and evaluated to ensure ECP policies are being followed. FSA’s IRDTS is a new centralized, automated internal control tracking system that allows management at all levels to complete and track program audits and reviews.
 
•	In May 2019, FSA leadership approved the funding and selected the platform for the development of the IRDTS software.  
•	By September 30, 2021, FSA will have incorporated its first phase (Phase 1) of programs that have review processes being completed manually. 
•	By December 1, 2021, FSA will begin the second phase (Phase 2) of incorporating FSA program reviews into IRDTS, which will include ECP. By using the IRDTS solution for applicable FSA Oversight Assessments, FSA will be able to plan, sample records, conduct assessment reviews, and document the results over time to score and track errors found during the reviews.  FSA will use this data to improve processes and policies, identify areas where additional employee training is needed and understand trends and systemic issues occurring at the state and county levels.

NOTE: Implementation of ECP into IRDTS is subjected to Agency budget availability and the priority of other program review candidates that are scheduled to be implemented. All phases of the integration of ECP district director reviews into IRDTS are estimated to be completed by September 30, 2022.

MEs provide a periodic assessment of State agency operations and administration and can result in a report of findings, which require the SA to correct any problems. This helps to ensure that SAs are properly monitoring certification and meal counting at the local level and are working with local operators to reduce improper payments. In addition, FNS continues to provide technical assistance related to the $50M released in FY 2024 for non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds for Child Nutrition (CN) State agencies to improve information technology (IT) systems. Throughout FY 2023, FNS worked with grant recipients who are using funds to develop, improve, maintain CN IT systems. FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by nTIG recipients administering CACFP will improve the SAs ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and take corrective actions.","[rnp4]Provide a minimum of 6-8 sentences describing the steps taken to ensure that executive managers, programs, and where appropriate, States and local governments are held accountable through annual performance appraisal criteria for meeting applicable reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and recovering overpayments.

Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

The agency’s internal assessment of Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters identified the leading causes for improper payments to be administrative in nature, resulting in processing errors, insufficient documentation, and inability to authenticate producer eligibility.  These errors included applications for ineligible participants and/or land; incomplete or improperly filed documentation supporting proper cost share payment; and missing, incomplete, or improperly filed Farm Service Agency or Commodity Credit Corporation forms required for Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters.  Lack of sufficient documentation from the producer was also a factor in making it difficult to reliably authenticate the eligibility of claims, resulting in inaccurate payments.

Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters is not a recurring program that Farm Service Agency personnel administer on a regular basis. Rather, Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters is a program administered following a qualifying disaster event and limited to the impacted area. Years may pass between a disaster event and program implementation in a state or county/parish.  The levels of experience and quality of training for personnel responsible for making program determinations or certifying payments is a contributing factor to the non-compliance.

(14) An increase of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance ($34,214,000 estimated in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. A change of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases to state and local index trends. 
An additional $10 million increase is for three current law proposals:
• The first current law proposal increases funding by $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS provides tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver specific programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program proposal, the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for more detail under the NPA section of this document. 
• The second proposal is for $6 million for FNS to restore the ability to provide timely program technical support. This proposal addresses ability to better respond to state and local policy and operational issues and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’ Ability to Provide Timely Program Technical Support” current law proposal for more details. 
• The third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated grants management and contract resources. Currently FNS manages 700 active CNP grants and expects to award another $100 million in new grants to States, tribes, schools and districts, non-profit organizations, and agricultural producers in 
FY 2023. The proposal, entitled, “Provide Dedicated Staff for Development, Management and Oversight of Program Specific Grant Programs and Procurements” addresses this need and can be referenced further within this document.    

(15) An increase of $5,706,000 for Child Nutrition (CN) Studies ($15,299,000 estimated in FY 2022). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CNP, including the federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The change consists of $87,000 for pay costs, $619,000 to match state and local index trends, and $5 million for a current law proposal titled, “Feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs,” to complete a feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs. 

(16) An increase of $888,000 for CN Payment Accuracy ($11,427,000 estimated in FY 2022). This funding supports FNS’ robust Federal oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. The increase consists of $462,000 to match state and local index trends and $426,000 due to pay cost.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

In April 2024, we issued a policy reminder to technicians to review cases carefully to determine whether retroactivity is applicable for surviving spouse benefits.  We also developed a “Potential Entitlements” Tactical Plan to educate people who may be eligible for Social Security benefits, particularly Survivors’ benefits and Supplemental Security Income.  It also includes targeted outreach by providing materials to third parties and our regional communications staffs.  We also conducted a longitudinal study on mailers in fiscal year (FY) 2024.

We created the WorkSmart project to reduce Improper Payments by alerting cases quickly after the beneficiary starts to work.  In FY 2024, WorkSmart continued to alert cases for work Continuing Disability Reviews (CDR) based on available earnings data.  WorkSmart will use Payroll Information Exchange data when available to alert cases for a work CDR.

Instead, FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies. FNS has developed a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision component of the program, and a separate methodology for the remaining components of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via the Erroneous Payments in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements vary significantly by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate of improper payments is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative methodologies for developing a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision meal claims component. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on at childcare.

CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake processing and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations, reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we released several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve the system.  In FY 2024, we will release several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process, increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted product is comprised of four separate workstreams, across several component business and systems sponsors.  In addition to work CDRs, the Product aims to modernize the medical CDR process with the addition of online service options and reduce paper case processing by automating current Electronic Disability Collect System exclusions.  In February 2023, CDR product released the i454 which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician's process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In fiscal year (FY) 2024, we plan to release Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the Electronic Disability Collect System (EDCS) that will reduce the reliance on paper processing. and plan to make the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We are currently beginning the development of a  modernized version of eWork which will eventually be integrated into the existing EDCS application and will make EDCS available for field office technicians.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining regions in FY 2024.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021, we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, six BOTs have been created and placed into production.  Use of the BOTs reduces keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes and eliminate manual actions.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","app1_1","To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations, reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year 2023, there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In December 2023, CCE Announcements became available.  Now, when updates are made within CCE, the technicians receive a brief message the first time they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related to CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements, we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation, which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error and reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional application.  We also plan to release our first retirement benefit application within CCE.  We will test it in a few field offices before a national release.

To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  In February 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all field offices and workload support units.  In March 2024, an additional task called External Tasks became available.  External Tasks provides technicians the ability to open commonly used applications directly from TED.  As of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications available via TED.  We plan to continue to enhance the customer composite by bringing in and displaying more customer information from other systems.  Releases to enhance existing functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We are also working on plans to expand to other user groups, such as field and regional offices, including Appellate Operations.  Integration of the technician facing portion of the Visitor Intake Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production.  In September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded the eSignature/Upload Documents service to all field offices and workload support units nationwide.  This release allows customers to access the service with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also, in March 2024, eSignature/Upload Documents became available to all Field Offices and Workload Support Units Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months, we began releasing mobile friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms for customer completion.  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated 10-day follow up reminder and confirmation of successful submission emails to enhance communication with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated the service with my Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text communications.  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms for a mobile friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and evidence types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social Security and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including the Upload Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand to 3rd party forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional support to our mutual customers.","[app1_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Automation corrective action(s) PLANNED.

In August 2023, the agency reconvened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative effort to shorten and simplify the SSI application process in a three-phased approach:  Phase I – Focuses on an expansion of the current internet claim (iClaim) with added SSI questions; Phase II – Focuses on technician supported modalities, which will encompass adult, aged, child, married, and third-party applications through the service delivery channels of in-person, telephone, and forms; and Phase III – This will establish an online, mobile-first, and public-facing system for the SSI and Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance programs and other applications, replicating the telephone, in-person, and paper service delivery channels.  Human-centered design testing will be employed to shape the mobile-first solution.  We completed the following in fiscal year 2024:  completed development of the expansion of the SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI process; posted to the Federal Register Notice (FRN) and obtained feedback from the public; reviewed the FRN comments and incorporated the feedback into our new three-phased approach; and reviewed the plan for the new approach with advocates/representatives and secured a decision to proceed from the Commissioner.  We plan to implement, in late 2024, the expansion of iSSI for SSI disability applicants.  The iSSI Release will expand iClaim and introduce as few as 12 user-tested, SSI-specific questions across 6 screens, shaping the simplified SSI application to be launched in late 2024.  We also plan to complete the following:  remove iClaim exclusions to allow online processing of approximately 5000 additional claims; finalize training and marketing materials; and complete final testing and prepare for a production release of the expanded iSSI.","[app4_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Change Process corrective action(s) PLANNED.

The AFI program uses an electronic process with participating financial institutions to verify bank account balances and detect undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks based on the residential address.  In March 2023, we released Policy in Focus training and issued a frontline broadcast to remind technicians of AFI and SSI financial accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account Verification Reminders and issued a frontline broadcast to ensure that technicians are reviewing the financial account pages in the SSI claims path for accuracy before adjudicating an event.  We began analysis on optimizing the use of AFI.  We expect to conclude our study on optimal frequency for use of AFI and related recommendations in fiscal year 2025.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed and failure to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data.  Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR). As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process.  We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our death data.

To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion to the SSI program.  Based on NCOA data analysis, we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating a notice to add a reminder informing concurrent OASDI and SSI recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding their living situation.  The notice will have clarified language to concurrent OASDI and SSI recipients informing them to contact us to report living arrangement changes that may have occurred with the address change received through the NCOA process.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In fiscal year 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements and allow us to respond to public concerns from the NPRM public comment period.","[app5_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Cross Enterprise Sharing corrective action(s) PLANNED.

Our annual Cost of Living Adjustment notices include reminders about reporting changes that could affect payments and eligibility.  In September 2013, we implemented an automated SSI wage reporting reminder for individuals who sign up to receive a monthly email or text message to report wages for the prior month.  We promote use of our online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with training videos including information about the importance of creating a my Social Security account; how to submit wages using myWR, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting, or SSI Telephone Wage Reporting; who can report; and reminders on reporting responsibilities.  In November 2022, we issued reporting responsibilities reminders to SSI recipients with a my Social Security account.  Finally, we engage the advocate community and other third-party groups and organizations to help the us reach more people who depend on our services by emailing Dear Colleague letters.  In August 2023, we sent a Dear Colleague letter asking for their assistance in reminding SSI clients on reporting changes in circumstances that may affect their payments.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we are working to simplify our notices.  Although we made efforts to simplify notices, some of our notices and communications can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain information.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the quality and understandability of our communications.  We will inform and remind recipients about reporting responsibilities.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","app4_1","Our Agency Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022-2026 established the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:

Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February 2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.

Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October 2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.

Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.

To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten the application process for SSI disability applicants.

"USDA","Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) National School Lunch Program (NSLP)","rap5","National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) do not have an administrative infrastructure for producing yearly estimates of improper payment rates and dollar values. Therefore, USDA uses its periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for NSLP and SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators. 

The Covid-19 pandemic changed NSLP and SBP operations beginning in March 2020 that affect improper payments due to certification error, which is the primary component of NSLP/SBP improper payments.  More specifically, beginning March 2020, School Food Authorities (SFAs) had the option to adopt waivers that allowed them to serve free meals to all participants through the NSLP’s Seamless Summer Option (SSO) or the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) without the need for applications. FNS recognized that State Agency's (SAs) and SFAs needed additional support and flexibility to continue serving meals to children while maintaining appropriate safety measures and managing the impacts of Covid-19.  In School Year (SY) 2021-2022, SFAs had the option of operating SSO or NSLP/SBP and almost all SFAs (90%) chose the SSO waiver, covering approximately 98% of total meals served in FY 2021-2022. Under SSO, all participants receive free meals and SFAs do not need to conduct eligibility determinations, so certification error does not apply for SFAs that used the waiver in SY 2021-2022. As a result, it is not included in the error rate for FY22.  Aggregation error, on the other hand, still applies as SFAs are still serving and counting meals.

Due to the operational flexibilities mentioned above, data that would allow USDA to age the improper payment estimates is not available for FY22.  Therefore, USDA used the aggregation error point estimate from APEC III as its measure of improper payments in NSLP and SBP. The point estimate reflects the most current assessment of error in the traditional NSLP/SBP programs, unaffected by temporary changes to the program due to Covid-19, and therefore is the most reflective rate of school meal operations in FY22.

Therefore, FNS uses its periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for NSLP and SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators. Due to the Covid-19 public health emergency, not all the macroeconomic data that are required for aging the data are available, so FNS will use the point estimates from APEC. 

Finally, the FNS FY 2021 Budget requested an increase in funding for the following program integrity line items to establish and maintain effective internal controls to reduce improper payments:

Child Nutrition (CN) Training and Technical Assistance— ($34,214,000 enacted in FY 2021). Effective and continual training and technical assistance is necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs and to ensure that States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This change is due to state/local index trends and a pay cost increase.

CN Payment Accuracy— ($11,427,000 enacted in FY 2021). This funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. This change consists of $224,000 and is due to a result of state/-local index trends and a pay cost increase.

CN Studies—($15,299,000 enacted in FY 2021). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports the critical evaluations needed for the Child Nutrition Programs, including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. This change reflects $300,000 and is due to state/local index trends, and a pay cost increase.

SNAP benefits are processed and administered by State agencies, with FNS oversight. State policy options, organizational structures, and use of technology vary from State to State, resulting in different root causes contributing to payment errors. The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, provides disincentives in the form of financial penalties to encourage States to accurately issue SNAP benefits and maintain low improper payment rates. The liability process to establish financial penalties against State agencies is statutory. In addition, FNS has a regulatory process that requires States to enter into corrective actions at the State level to address payment error rates that exceed six percent, a standard established by law. FNS provides oversight and technical assistance, to States in measuring and reporting improper payments. Because FNS does not provide benefits directly to recipients, the Program must work through its State administering agencies to measure, monitor, and address improper payments. SNAP will not issue an error rate for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 and (FY) 2021 due to a lack of information. Specifically, COVID-19 related flexibilities provided to the Sstate agencies that administer SNAP, and provisions in both 2021 continuing appropriations acts (P.L. 116-159 and 116-260) suspended the quality control system SNAP uses to collect error rate data for significant portions of FY 2020 and FY2021.

As part of the development of the update, FNS is focused on solutions that incorporate caseload size and administrative characteristics to address variations in SNAP administration across all 53 SNAP State and Territorial agencies. 

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, FNS will provide third-party income verification services for all State SNAP agencies. Errors related to earned income regularly account for the top three causes of error nationally and within State agencies. This is expected to provide States with improved resources to accurately determine income for the SNAP benefit calculation. FNS plans to make an official announcement about the vendor(s) awarded the contract in October 2023 and then make the income verification resource available to all States shortly thereafter.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

(14) An increase of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance ($34,214,000 estimated in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. A change of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases to state and local index trends. 
An additional $10 million increase is for three current law proposals:
• The first current law proposal increases funding by $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS provides tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver specific programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program proposal, the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for more detail under the NPA section of this document. 
• The second proposal is for $6 million for FNS to restore the ability to provide timely program technical support. This proposal addresses ability to better respond to state and local policy and operational issues and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’ Ability to Provide Timely Program Technical Support” current law proposal for more details. 
• The third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated grants management and contract resources. Currently FNS manages 700 active CNP grants and expects to award another $100 million in new grants to States, tribes, schools and districts, non-profit organizations, and agricultural producers in 
FY 2023. The proposal, entitled, “Provide Dedicated Staff for Development, Management and Oversight of Program Specific Grant Programs and Procurements” addresses this need and can be referenced further within this document.    

(15) An increase of $5,706,000 for Child Nutrition (CN) Studies ($15,299,000 estimated in FY 2022). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CNP, including the federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The change consists of $87,000 for pay costs, $619,000 to match state and local index trends, and $5 million for a current law proposal titled, “Feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs,” to complete a feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs. 

(16) An increase of $888,000 for CN Payment Accuracy ($11,427,000 estimated in FY 2022). This funding supports FNS’ robust Federal oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. The increase consists of $462,000 to match state and local index trends and $426,000 due to pay cost.

"USDA","Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) School Breakfast Program (SBP)","rap5","National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) do not have an administrative infrastructure for producing yearly estimates of improper payment rates and dollar values. Therefore, USDA uses its periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for NSLP and SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators. 

The Covid-19 pandemic changed NSLP and SBP operations beginning in March 2020 that affect improper payments due to certification error, which is the primary component of NSLP/SBP improper payments.  More specifically, beginning March 2020, School Food Authorities had the option to adopt waivers that allowed them to serve free meals to all participants through the NSLP’s Seamless Summer Option (SSO) or the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) without the need for applications. FNS recognized that State Agency's and SFAs needed additional support and flexibility to continue serving meals to children while maintaining appropriate safety measures and managing the impacts of Covid-19.  In School Year (SY) 2021-2022, SFAs had the option of operating SSO or NSLP/SBP and almost all SFAs (90%) chose the SSO waiver, covering approximately 98% of total meals served in FY 2021-2022. Under SSO, all participants receive free meals and SFAs do not need to conduct eligibility determinations, so certification error does not apply for SFAs that used the waiver in SY 2021-2022. As a result, it is not included in the error rate for FY22.  Aggregation error, on the other hand, still applies as SFAs are still serving and counting meals.

Due to the operational flexibilities mentioned above, data that would allow USDA to age the improper payment estimates is not available for FY22.  Therefore, USDA used the aggregation error point estimate from APEC III as its measure of improper payments in NSLP and SBP. The point estimate reflects the most current assessment of error in the traditional NSLP/SBP programs, unaffected by temporary changes to the program due to Covid-19, and therefore is the most reflective rate of school meal operations in FY22.

Therefore, FNS uses its periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for NSLP and SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators. Due to the Covid-19 public health emergency, not all the macroeconomic data that are required for aging the data are available, so FNS will use the point estimates from APEC. 

Finally, the FNS FY 2021 Budget requested an increase in funding for the following program integrity line items to establish and maintain effective internal controls to reduce improper payments:

Child Nutrition (CN) Training and Technical Assistance— ($34,214,000 enacted in FY 2021). Effective and continual training and technical assistance is necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs and to ensure that States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This change is due to state/local index trends and a pay cost increase.

CN Payment Accuracy— ($11,427,000 enacted in FY 2021). This funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. This change consists of $224,000 and is due to a result of state/-local index trends and a pay cost increase.

CN Studies—($15,299,000 enacted in FY 2021). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports the critical evaluations needed for the Child Nutrition Programs, including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work.

"USDA","Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Trade Mitigation Program (TMP)","rap5","Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation at the overall arching and broader Agency level. 

Farm Service Agency will require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   

Human Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive and robust compliance program.  

Farm Service Agency once had staff positions whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer, but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties. Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.

Information Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance; therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative entries and processes. 

Several transactional program systems and software “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems. 

From an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned through fiscal year 2024. 

Other Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to: 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical, survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling” and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators, anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation of authorities for approvals, etc.  

These actions will also assist in capturing program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. 

Farm Service Agency is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency, data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to support important mission-focused decision-making.  

Farm Service Agency has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio, Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity, and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit","rap6","The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance and reduce erroneous payments. 

For  FY 2021 , the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget submission:

Provide the IRS with greater flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.

Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence in the tax system.

For  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal, as well as the following additional proposal:

Increase penalties on ghost preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer. The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","app4_1","The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments are reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.","[app4_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Change Process corrective action(s) PLANNED.

If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and

The regulatory structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to include the lack of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of EITC improper payments. Specifically,  at the time of filing/payment the IRS cannot  readily authenticate eligibility for the credit, i.e., whether a claimed child in fact qualifies, meeting the many nuances of the Age, Relationship, Residency and Joint Return tests. This is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Finally, each year there are many taxpayers who claim and receive EITC for the first time, who have to understand and apply the complex eligibility requirements.

The regulatory structure of the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC), to include the lack of a preapproval process (notwithstanding anything that occurs in the Advance PTC process) and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of Net PTC improper payments. Specifically, at the time of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily verify certain information, i.e., taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. This is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist. In addition, each year there are many taxpayers who receive PTC for the first time, who have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including Net PTC, prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a refund.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

"TREASURY","Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit","rnp3","The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental root causes of the Earned Income Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there's an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing with many nuances); (b) there's instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there's a turnover of taxpayer who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the IRS's information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules compliance and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts aid the Service in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) anticipates that the SD Proposed Rule and companion application will streamline the SD process and provide a user-friendly method for accurately implementing the process. This will improve our method for identifying and ultimately addressing SDs in the Child and Adult care Food Program (CACFP).

Progress on CACFP Integrity Studies
FNS is using the preliminary results of the Erroneous Payments in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS) as a base for its Improper Payment (IP) estimates in CACFP centers. The study is pending publication. In addition, FNS has continued to invest in the identification of a feasible method for assessing meal claiming error in family daycare homes. 

CN Program Integrity Rule 
FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help FNS and State administering agencies to reduce program error of all types, resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program requirements. Authorizing FNS to provide additional audit funds to States will help them meet audit and monitoring requirements and improve overall program management.

Differences indicate potential overpayments, so correcting the differences ensures VA is making correct payments and prevents future improper payments. In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable to failure to access data/information prior to issuing payment. To address the root cause, VA will use the existing match between Social Security Administration income data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to identify variances which are indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with variances are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve discrepancies, identify and establish debts for overpayments if applicable, and prevent future overpayments. In addition, VA uses the Social Security Administrations Death Master File to match against active beneficiaries and their dependents, which allows VA to stop payment timely for deceased beneficiaries. These ongoing Social Security Administration matches identify potentially deceased beneficiaries still receiving benefits for VA to stop benefits and prevent overpayments.

"VA","Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent","rnp3","The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program prioritized and implemented effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of rate reductions and projections under the statutory threshold for significant improper payments of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57% (a reduction of 1.92%) and improper and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82 million reduction). In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were effective, two were designed effectively, and one was designed ineffectively. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.

For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $23.30 million in FY 2023 to $8.57 million in FY 2024, or a 63% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the unknown payment amount from $27.74 million in FY 2023 to $0.73 million in FY 2024, or a 97% reduction. For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024.

Due to the program successfully reporting an error rate under 1.5% and improper payments under $100 million in FY 2024, an effectiveness review will not be performed in FY 2025.

"USDA","Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) National School Lunch Program (NSLP)","rap6","In order to establish and maintain internal controls in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has requested the following budget increases to the Child Nutrition Block, of which NSLP is included (Source:  2023 USDA Explanatory Notes - Food and Nutrition Service): 

(14) An increase of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance ($34,214,000 estimated in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. A change of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases to state and local index trends. 
An additional $10 million increase is for three current law proposals:
• The first current law proposal increases funding by $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS provides tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver specific programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program proposal, the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for more detail under the NPA section of this document. 
• The second proposal is for $6 million for FNS to restore the ability to provide timely program technical support. This proposal addresses ability to better respond to state and local policy and operational issues and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’ Ability to Provide Timely Program Technical Support” current law proposal for more details. 
• The third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated grants management and contract resources. Currently FNS manages 700 active CNP grants and expects to award another $100 million in new grants to States, tribes, schools and districts, non-profit organizations, and agricultural producers in 
FY 2023. The proposal, entitled, “Provide Dedicated Staff for Development, Management and Oversight of Program Specific Grant Programs and Procurements” addresses this need and can be referenced further within this document.    

(15) An increase of $5,706,000 for Child Nutrition (CN) Studies ($15,299,000 estimated in FY 2022). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CNP, including the federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The change consists of $87,000 for pay costs, $619,000 to match state and local index trends, and $5 million for a current law proposal titled, “Feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs,” to complete a feasibility study for a national system for State reviews of CNPs. 

(16) An increase of $888,000 for CN Payment Accuracy ($11,427,000 estimated in FY 2022). This funding supports FNS’ robust Federal oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. The increase consists of $462,000 to match state and local index trends and $426,000 due to pay cost.","[rap6]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences describing the resources requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.

"VA","Pension","cyp4_1","VA overpayments outside the agency’s control occur when the program is either unable to access information which is needed or the information needed does not exist to validate payment accuracy prior to payment due to regulatory barriers. Specifically, overpayments occur when Social Security benefits are increased as the result of a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, the Pension maximum annual rates are increased by a like percentage at the same time (per Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Improved Pension Rates (3.23). The effective date of Social Security Administration and Pension cost-of-living adjustments is December 1; which are paid January 1. Pension is unable to prevent these overpayments from occurring because VA is unable to access the ‘post cost-of-living adjustment’ Social Security Administration income amount data at the time in which VA makes its cost-of-living adjustment changes in December for the January Pension payments. The cost of establishing additional cross data sharing with the Social Security Administration has been explored and the cost of internal and external IT information technology infrastructure and strategic changes are not cost effective.

Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Elections of Pension or Compensation (3.701) requires VA to pay a beneficiary who has dual entitlements (Pension and Compensation) the higher of the two amounts; unless a beneficiary specifically elects one over the other. 

Overpayments can also occur when beneficiaries, as allowed by the Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Computation of Income (3.271), provide revised medical expenses to VA after payments are made. VA is unable to prevent these overpayments from occurring because regulations require VA to make applicable retroactive adjustments based upon the revised medical expenses for which beneficiaries are the sole source of information. In addition, overpayments occur if Prisoner status information is not timely received, resulting in overpayments. VA is unable to prevent these overpayments from occurring because VA relies on sources outside the agency to provide timely prisoner status information.","[cyp4_1]Provide a minimum of 3-5 sentences explaining why the overpayments are outside of the agency control.

"VA","Beneficiary Travel","rnp3","The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies designed to reduce improper and unknown payments. In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Beneficiary Travel program indicated that of the four actions assessed, three were designed effectively and one was designed ineffectively. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. 

Through implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Beneficiary Travel reduced overpayments from $88.50 million in FY 2023 to $86.22 million in FY 2024, or a $2.28 million reduction. Additionally, Beneficiary Travel experienced a $91.78 million increase in outlays, specifically in program areas where errors tend to occur. VA has increased the sample size in this program area to gain additional insight into the root error cause(s) occurring and plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas. For errors tied to failure to access data/information, errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, and errors tied to errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024. 

VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process.

"USDA","Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) School Breakfast Program (SBP)","rnp3","Process Change - Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion
The Food and Nutrition service (FNS) expects that increased CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.
Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV
With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use a new baseline estimate for improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), improving our projected error rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications. From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.
Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule
FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types, resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.
The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.
Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)
Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified for free meals without the need for a household application based on household participation in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct certification is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification error in Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.
Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)
FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State's ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.
Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service
FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to encourage adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit data to their States.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

These actions will help bring the program into compliance by reducing errors associated with failure to access data/information and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. The Executive Director for Pension and Fiduciary Service’s performance plan includes performance metrics appropriate to ensure mission is met while still ensuring payment integrity.

Generally, VA Senior Executives are held accountable via the performance appraisal process as established by VA’s Corporate Senior Executive Management Office. This process includes oversight from VA’s Performance Review Board, which evaluates each executive’s performance appraisal, the executive’s response to the initial summary rating, if any, and the results of any higher-level official’s findings and recommendations. Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned with each Senior Executive’s overall level of performance.","[rnp4]Provide a minimum of 6-8 sentences describing the steps taken to ensure that executive managers, programs, and where appropriate, States and local governments are held accountable through annual performance appraisal criteria for meeting applicable reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and recovering overpayments.

The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program indicated that of the five  actions assessed, one was closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was closed and determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root cause, two were open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.

For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $158.38 million in FY 2020 to $74.79 million in FY 2021, or a 53% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $2,131.72 million in FY 2020 to $912.36 million in FY 2021, or a 57% reduction.

"VA","Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent","rnp3","The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of rate reductions. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 2.70% to 2.49%, a reduction of 0.21%. In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2022.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, two were open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.

For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment amount from $27.87 million in FY 2021 to $27.68 million in FY 2022, or a 1% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the unknown payment amount from $34.99 million in FY 2021 to $14.97 million in FY 2022, or a 57% reduction. For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2021 to FY 2022.

VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2024.","[rnp3]Provide a minimum of 6-9 sentences describing how the level of planned or completed actions (in the corrective action plan) addresses the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.

Lowering the minimum ISP gives states and LEAs greater flexibility to offer no-cost meals to all enrolled students.  Electing CEP is a voluntary decision made by LEAs based on their unique student populations, and FNS understands that lowering the minimum ISP will result in more schools being eligible for CEP.  However, it is essential to ensure financial viability for newly eligible schools electing CEP at lower ISPs. FNS's guidance and technical assistance will help LEA decisionmakers consider student nutrition, educational, administrative, and financial factors prior to electing CEP.  FNS will provide technical assistance to State agencies and coordinate with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services when needed to help ensure their readiness to conduct successful, accurate projects, and understand reporting requirements.

Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This includes a total of $17.1 million for current law proposals, $3.8 million of which is for a 2025 proposal and $13.3 million is for 2024 re-proposals. The requested increase includes $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Increase Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation, $1.3 million and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation and oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the Child Nutrition (CN) Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget lines. The next current law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical Assistance, which enhances the Food and Nutrition Service’s ability to provide critical training, technical assistance, and oversight to ensure program integrity and compliance with Federal law and regulations for CN in both national and regional offices. The fourth current law proposal for $2 million is to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Enterprise Risk Management: helps with approaches in FNS strategic planning and program operations. The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.

FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively, which include improving public health, nutrition, and equity. This program line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CN Programs, including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The request includes $2 million for the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Research on the U.S. Territories. The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.

FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related to program integrity and analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration and integrity. FNS has also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality. FNS developed the WIC Certification and Eligibility Resource Guide, which was released on July 16, 2021. Additional resources will be developed as needed. FNS is working to develop the WIC Certification Handbook, which is expected to be released in FY 2021. Additional resources will be developed as needed. 
The most cost-effective way for FNS to produce yearly estimates of WIC improper payments is by using periodic studies to estimate WIC certification and vendor payment errors. FNS uses the National Survey of WIC Participants and the WIC Vendor Management Study to estimate and report payment errors. The results of these studies are also used to inform FNS’ program integrity work—including the development of additional guidance, training, and resources for WIC State agencies—and to provide information to Congress and other stakeholders. 

Additionally, FNS continues to look for innovative ways to leverage technology to improve WIC program integrity. FNS continues to work with WIC State agencies to implement WIC Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) nationwide. EBT provides WIC State agencies with more accurate and timely data that they can use to monitor food costs and identify suspect transactions, in turn reducing the risk of payment errors.

To address the root cause, VA will use the existing match between Social Security Administration income data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to identify variances which are indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with variances are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve discrepancies, adjust benefits if appropriate, and prevent future overpayments.

"VA","Supplies and Materials","rnp3","The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies designed to reduce improper and unknown payments. In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2023.

The results for the Supplies and Materials program indicated that of the two actions assessed, two were open and determined to be designed effectively to mitigate the root cause. 

Through implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31 million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction. Additionally, Supplies and Materials experienced a $395 million increase in outlays, specifically in program areas where technically improper payments tend to occur. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met and for errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions did not result in a reduction from FY 2023 to FY 2024. VA plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas to ensure they address the root cause(s) of error.

If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.

DHA has internal controls in place to support the reduction of improper payments in the TRICARE purchased health care program to the levels the DHA has targeted.  Effective January 1, 2018, and in fulfillment of section 701 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017, the DHA implemented sweeping changes to the TRICARE health benefits structure and MCS contract management to synchronize these changes.  As a result, the DHA transitioned its TRICARE-3 MCSCs (supported by three regional contracts/contractors) to the TRICARE 2017 contract and regional oversight model (supported by two regional contracts/contractors).  
While the transition of MCSC contracts from three to two was considered a success, the transitioning of claims processing services under one of the two T2017 MCSC was met with challenges and control failures.  As a result of a contractor’s poor claims processing performance, DHA’s program and contracting offices increased oversight and monitoring of the T2017 contractor.  Significant progress was made in FY 2020 and FY 2021 by the DHA and the MCSC contractor to resolve this deficiency and DHA met its goal of full resolution by the FY 2021 AFR reporting cycle.  Moreover, the Contract Resource Management division of DHA received an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements in FY 2020.

Human Capital:
Currently, DHA does not have the Human Capital it needs to respond to audit findings and recommendations to reduce improper payments in the Military Health Benefits program to the level the Agency has targeted. DHA is evaluating the possibility of adding two additional FTEs to their payment integrity efforts. 
Per a DoDIG recommendation in 2019, Administrative and Other Payment sampling and audits are being developed for annual improper payment reporting. These audits for PIIA compliance, are in addition to the current Prompt Pay Audits, and have demonstrated a need for additional Human Capital. Much work has already been done to identify internal control weaknesses and identify and gather additional necessary documentation; but, the resources to review payments in their entirety are insufficient. DHA is anticipating a risk assessment for USFHP, which accounts for nearly 40% of administrative costs, and has identified other administrative payments that are suited for risk assessments. For time-intensive manual CAP-DME payment reviews, a database was developed to track prior payments to avoid duplicate requests for payment in future invoices. This database is in its third phase of development and has showed effectiveness in preventing duplicate payments going forward. 
In addition, DHA anticipates the agency will need additional skill sets and personnel resources to make determinations on improper payments when addressing adjustments in both the universes and in payment errors for PIIA reporting.

Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:
DHA has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Health Benefits program to the levels the Agency has targeted.  The Agency Private Sector program (managed by the Contract Resource Management Division) includes an immense volume of healthcare claims processed by TRICARE private sector contractors, into the Agency’s TRICARE Encounter Date (TED) Operational Data Store (ODS). To track programs, CRM utilizes 1) the TRICARE Encounter Data Set (TEDS), a financial feeder system through which claims are processed to Oracle Federal Financials, 2) the E-Commerce System (ECS), an integrated, centralized major system that improves the Agency’s core financial, contracting and business process by providing seamless integrated financial and contracting systems, and 3) the Oracle Federal Financials (OFF), a financial subsystem of the Agency’s ECS.  The OFF system supports budget and accounting/financial functions and health care (TEDS) claims processing and contains TRICARE Claims Management, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders and General Ledger modules.

The Department of the Air Force (DAF) has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper payments in its Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. The DAF has implemented and/or directly supported the following control monitoring activities to identify and recover overpayments and/or correct under payments:
- The DFAS post-payment reviews in support of PIIA compliance and reporting.
- Entitlement verifications, management notice reconciliations, and reports, such as Basic Allowance for Housing/Overseas Housing Allowance Recertification, Dependency Discrepancy Reconciliation, Flight Pay Verification, Delinquent Pay Authorization, and reconciliation of travel status to mil pay entitlements.
- Pay Record Accessibility: audit the pay records of personnel with military pay system access.
- Self-assessment checklists in military pay, quality assurance, and the resource management checklist for commanders, resource center managers, and resource advisors.
- Metrics in military pay, such as dependency discrepancy, to monitor pay affecting mismatches between the personnel and military pay systems.
- Case Management System (CMS) to control complex pay cases and the Customer Service Portal (CSP) to allow them to quantify and better analyze customer service interactions and overpayment recoveries. Moreover, Military Pay Services, which support the end-to-end delivery of payroll processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2023.

Human Capital:
The DAF must devote more human capital resources to meet Department targets, aggressive timelines, and levels of performance. 

Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:
The DAF has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as technology advances, the DAF and the Department continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Military Pay through implementation of new integrated pay and personnel processing systems.

However, DJMS is a legacy entitlement system requiring manual handoffs and processing. It will be replaced by the Air Force Integrated Pay and Personnel System (AFIPPS) in the future. Under AFIPPS, improper payments will be reduced because entitlements will be directly inputted into the Military Pay payroll system by an authorized personnel source thereby eliminating all manual processing. Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023.","[rap5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences elaborating on whether the agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate (i.e., a level below which further expenditures to reduce improper payments would cost more than the amount those expenditures would save in prevented or recovered improper payments).

To mitigate improper payments, the agency employs several measures, including: Annuitant Surveys: These are sent electronically or by mail to verify eligibility.

We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act.

Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.

"SSA","Supplemental Security Income (SSI)","rnp4","We are committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensuring the public has confidence that we manage their tax dollars wisely.  We demonstrate a commitment to sound management practices.  To ensure stewardship and the efficient administration of our programs, we have established performance measures in our Annual Performance Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2023–2024 to track our progress.  Under Strategic Objective 3.1 – Improve the Accuracy and Administration of our Programs, there are two performance measures directly related to reduction of improper payments:  

3.1a - Improve the integrity of the Supplemental Security Income program by focusing our efforts on reducing overpayments.  

3.1b - Maintain a high payment accuracy rate by reducing overpayments, in the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program.

Under our annual Performance Accountability and Communication System, all agency managers have a critical element called “Manages Performance.”  This element includes two performance standards related to preventing and reducing improper payments:  establishes and maintains suitable internal controls to prevent improper payments; and uses established guidelines to reduce and recover improper payments.

We assess managers throughout the agency on these standards each year and hold them accountable for meeting improper payment reduction targets.  Each agency component adds expectations that are more detailed for their positions describing what is expected for meeting these performance standards.

Senior Executive performance plans must clearly align with organizational goals and objectives under the Results Driven Critical Element.  Performance levels in the performance requirements must reflect agency targets.

We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), consisting of senior executive membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.  The Deputy Commissioner of the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight (OARO) serves as the executive chair for the IPOB.  To further our focus on reducing improper payments, in FY 2019, we established an Improper Payments Prevention Team now referred to as the Improper Payments Prevention Branch, in OARO.  The team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate the root causes of improper payments.  As part of our IPAS, we will evaluate the effectiveness of each planned or ongoing mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we will determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies, as needed.  IPOB is responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all improper payment initiatives.

We have a strong internal control environment that has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  We directly leverage our existing internal control environment and assurance processes to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating effectively.  

As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.  

The effective internal controls we incorporate into our business processes and financial management systems, as well as the program integrity efforts, support our Commissioner’s annual assurance statement to the President and Congress.

In April 2019, we established the Enterprise Fraud Risk Management (EFRM) program to systematically assess fraud risks across our major programmatic and administrative areas.  Through our EFRM program we have conducted multiple fraud risk assessments on key areas such as Disability, Electronic Services, Administrative Services, and the Representative Payee program.  After each fraud risk assessment, our senior executives review each fraud risk and determine whether our controls are effective or whether we need to develop additional controls to further reduce the risk.  For each risk designated as “reduce” by our executives, we develop additional mitigation strategies to further prevent or detect the fraud.  The risk response and the designated mitigation strategies form the basis of the fraud risk profile for each fraud area.

We completed a maintenance fraud risk assessment of the Agency’s Administrative Services during FY 2024 and continued the reassessment of the disability fraud risk profile, consistent with the Government Accountability Office guidance, to reassess fraud risk profiles on a three-year cycle.  We also finalized the Fraud Risk Profiles for the Enumeration program at the end of calendar year 2023.

For recovery of overpayments, when negotiating a rate of overpayment recovery, we attempted to recover within 36 months before requiring income and expense documentation.  In February 2024, we changed our policy to extend this timeframe to 60 months and reduced the burden on our beneficiaries to provide additional financial and resource information.

The fundamental root causes of the Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there is an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing many nuances); (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayer who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the IRS's information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility rules and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts aid the IRS in mitigating the impact of these root causes.

Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors are most likely to occur. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.","[app4_1]Provide a minimum of 2-5 sentences describing the Change Process corrective action(s) PLANNED.

The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program task force formed in the spring of 2024, suggested policy improvements to reduce findings associated with calculating production. One example is removing the requirement that all production must be verifiable or reliable.

FNS has a robust review process that includes State-level review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of States to ensure program integrity within the program. Applicable for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, FNS has issued a policy memo to State program operators of the CACFP FDCH Tiering Decision entitled, ""Area Eligibility for Summer 2022 and School Year 2022-2023"", providing guidance on determining CACFP eligibility when school data is unavailable. FDCHs use school or census data to establish geographic eligibility.

Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.

The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.

FNS has the administrative infrastructure for meeting reduction targets, establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, and producing yearly estimates of WIC improper payment rates and dollar values. Management evaluations (MEs) are FNS's primary oversight mechanisms. MEs include onsite reviews of State and local agency operations, and reviews of program-specific documentation. FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related to program integrity and analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration and integrity. FNS has also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality. FNS developed the WIC Certification and Eligibility Resource Guide, which was released on July 16, 2021. Additional resources will be developed as needed. FNS is working to develop the WIC Certification Handbook, which is expected to be released in FY 2021. Additional resources will be developed as needed. 
The most cost-effective way for FNS to produce yearly estimates of WIC improper payments is by using periodic studies to estimate WIC certification and vendor payment errors. FNS uses the National Survey of WIC Participants and the WIC Vendor Management Study to estimate and report payment errors. The results of these studies are also used to inform FNS' program integrity work-including the development of additional guidance, training, and resources for WIC State agencies-and to provide information to Congress and other stakeholders. 
Additionally, FNS continues to look for innovative ways to leverage technology to improve WIC program integrity. FNS continues to work with WIC State agencies to implement WIC Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) nationwide. EBT provides WIC State agencies with more accurate and timely data that they can use to monitor food costs and identify suspect transactions, in turn reducing the risk of payment errors.","[rap5]Provide a minimum of 2-4 sentences elaborating on whether the agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate (i.e., a level below which further expenditures to reduce improper payments would cost more than the amount those expenditures would save in prevented or recovered improper payments).

The only federal financial requirement for TEFAP eligibility is that States must have an income-based standard.  Each State sets their own threshold and guidelines and are solely responsible for the data.  Local agencies must collect and maintain on record the basis for determining household eligibility.  This financial data is unavailable to the National Office, as it is kept at the local agency level. This could lead to improper payments if a local agency gave commodities to ineligible individuals. 

Improper payments are monitored during Federal Management Evaluations (ME) of State Operations.  MEs are conducted by FNS Regional Offices and include a review of all program operations including inventory controls, certification procedures, and administrative expense controls. 

Additionally, State agencies are required to review Local Program operations.  As part of these reviews, State agencies evaluate how local organizations conduct eligibility determinations, food ordering procedures, storage and warehousing practices, inventory controls, and adherence to reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 

Audits and inspections are also conducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) or independent auditors and evaluate program operations, identify program issues, and uncover potential funding discrepancies.

In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2022. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Beneficiary Travel program indicated that of the four actions assessed, three were open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.

For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper payment amount from $81.31 million in FY 2021 to $58.95 million in FY 2022, or a 28% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the unknown payment amount from $36.73 million in FY 2021 to $24.04 million in FY 2022, or a 35% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2021 to FY 2022.

The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency.  The results of the Pension program indicated that of the seven actions assessed, four were closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root cause, and two were designed ineffectively to mitigate the root cause.

For errors tied to failure to access data/information and inability to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in improper payment amount from $410.52m in FY 2020 to $378.87m in FY 2021, or a 7% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions contributed to a total reduction in the unknown payment amount from $4.64m in FY 2020 to $2.63m in FY 2021, or a 43% reduction.

In addition, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will work to establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. These actions are designed to address overpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.

In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2022. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the VA Community Care program indicated that of the eight actions assessed, seven were closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, and one was open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.
