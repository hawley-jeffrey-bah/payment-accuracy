  rnp3: 'HHS continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and

    rate decreased from 7.46% to 7.38%.


    The actions taken and planned to address the root causes of the improper payment
    rate and are proportional to the associated amount and address the root causes
    of the improper payments. For example, in FY 2023, the primary drivers of the
    improper payment rate are Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), Hospital Outpatient,
    and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) claims. To drive down the improper
    payment rate, HHS continues nationwide prior authorization for hospital outpatient
    claims. Medicare review contractors continue to identify and prevent improper
    payments due to documentation errors in error-prone claim types, including SNF,
    hospital outpatient and IRF. HHS also announced an expansion of its home health
    review choice demonstration to a sixth state and started a review choice demonstration
    for inpatient rehabilitation facility services. HHS will continue to develop and

      The primary causes of Medicare Fee-for-Service improper payments are insufficient
      documentation and medical necessity errors for skilled nursing facilities, hospital
      outpatient, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and hospice claims.  Refer
      to the HHS AFR for information.
  pro1: The Reporting Year (RY) 2024 Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) improper payment
    rate is statistically similar to the RY 2023 Medicare FFS improper payment rate.
  rap5: A tolerable rate has not been established for this program. The tolerable
    rate will be identified when the methodology is developed. Once the tolerable
    rate is developed, the agency can determine if we have what is needed with respect
    to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure
    to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: "To establish and maintain payment integrity internal controls in HHS included\
    \ the following program integrity proposals in its FY 2026 Budget request:\n\n\
    â€¢\tShare Information on Providers Subject to a Medicare Payment Suspension with\
    \ Supplemental Payers and Hold Beneficiaries Harmless\nâ€¢\tEstablish an Access-to-Care\
    \ Exceptions Process for Future Enrollment Moratoria Provide the Secretary with\
    \ the authority to establish an exceptions process for any future enrollment moratoria\
    \ based on access-to-care concerns. \nâ€¢\tExpand Prior Authorization to Medicare\
    \ Fee-for-Service Home Health Services \nâ€¢\tAllow More Flexibility for Early Termination/Cancellation\
    \ of Medicare Practitioner Opt-Out \nâ€¢\tIncrease Ownership Transparency and Require\
    \ Skilled Nursing Facility Private Equity or Real Estate Investment Trust Ownership\
    \ to Provide Additional Disclosures\nâ€¢\tEnsure Providers that Violate Medicare\
    \ Safety Requirements and Have Harmed Patients Cannot Quickly Reenter the Program\
    \ \nâ€¢\tProhibit Unsolicited Medicare Beneficiary Contacts\nâ€¢\tBolster Medicare\
    \ & Medicaid Affiliations Provision by Targeting Problematic Nursing Home Owners\
    \ and Decreasing Provider Affiliations Reporting Burden \n"
  rnp3: 'HHS continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments and unknown payments agency-wide
    as evidenced by its error rate of 7.66%. The actions taken and planned to address
    the root causes of the improper payment rate and are proportional to the associated
    amount and address the root causes of the improper payments. For example, in FY
    2024, the primary drivers of the improper payment rate are Skilled Nursing Facility
    (SNF), Hospital Outpatient, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF), and Hospice
    claims. To drive down the improper payment rate, HHS continues nationwide prior
    authorization for hospital outpatient claims. Medicare review contractors continue
    to identify and prevent improper payments due to documentation errors in error-prone
    claim types, including SNF, hospital outpatient and IRF. HHS also revamped its
    hospice strategy to reduce the hospice error rate. HHS will continue to develop
    and prioritize additional CAPs in FY 2025 based on the FY 2024 improper payment
    rate data.

    '
  rnp4: 'The agency''s internal controls to detect, prevent, and recover improper
    payments are reported annually in the AFR. In addition, the agency sets annual
    performance goals related to the improper payment rates and reports quarterly
    on specific corrective actions to address improper payment rates through the quarterly
    scorecard process for high-priority programs.

Description: Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) is a federal health insurance program
  that provides hospital insurance (Part A) and supplementary medical insurance (Part
  B) to eligible citizens. The primary causes of overpayments continue to be insufficient
  documentation and medical necessity errors for skilled nursing facilities, hospital
  outpatient, hospice, and home health claims. A known barrier to preventing improper
  payments is that providers' and suppliers' compliance with requirements is outside
  of the agency's control.
