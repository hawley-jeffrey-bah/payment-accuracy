  pro1: Per discussion with OMB, the Employment & Training Administration - Unemployment
    Insurance - Federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) is listed
    as a program for payment integrity reporting purposes. However because PEUC’s
    eligibility and payment structure are materially similar to the "traditional"
    Unemployment Insurance program, payment integrity rates are extrapolated and its
    outlays are included in the "traditional" Unemployment Insurance program's reporting
    for this report. This same format was used for FY21 reporting.

      \ a comprehensive package of provisions designed to provide new and expanded\
      \ tools and controls for states to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers\
      \ are properly paid and to prevent fraud and improper payments in the UI system.\
      \  The package includes the following components:\n\n•\tRequire states to use\
      \ system(s) designated by the Secretary for cross-matching claimants to prevent\
      \ and detect improper payments, including fraud, which would currently include\
      \ the IDH. \n•\tRequire states to use system(s) designated by the Secretary\
      \ for electronic transmission of requests for information relating to UC and\
      \ the provision of such information between the state UI agency and employers\
      \ or their agents, which would currently include SIDES.\n•\tRequire states to\
      \ cross-match against the NDNH to better identify individuals continuing to\
      \ claim UC after returning to work, which is one of the leading root causes\
      \ of UI improper payments.\n•\tRequire states to cross-match with a system(s)\

      \ incarcerated, which would currently include the SSA’s PUPS.\n•\tRequire states\
      \ to disclose information to the DOL-OIG to conduct audits and investigations\
      \ to discover fraud, waste, and abuse or inefficiencies in the UC programs.\
      \ \n•\tProvide the Secretary with meaningful enforcement authority and the ability\
      \ to reward good performance.  This proposal would create a new remedy so that\
      \ instead of withholding a state’s entire administrative grant for failing to\
      \ meet the performance measures or achieve minimum technology standards, the\
      \ Secretary can require a portion of the state’s administrative grant be used\
      \ to correct failing performance and/or have the state participate in required\
      \ technical assistance activities offered by USDOL.\n•\tAllow states to retain\
      \ up to five percent of recovered fraudulent UI overpayments for program integrity\
      \ use.\n•\tRequire states to use penalty and interest collections solely for\
      \ UI administration.\n•\tAllow states the authority to issue a formal warning\
      \ when claimants are unclear on the work search requirements.\n•\tAllow states\
      \ to use contract support in recovery efforts under the Treasury Offset Program\
      \ (TOP).\n\nFurthermore, the ETA is considering changes to the UI confidentiality\

      \ a secure messaging platform for states, ETA, and the DOL-OIG to share information\
      \ through the IDH on emergent fraud schemes.\n•\tIdentity Verification (IDV)\
      \ – provides states with a centralized, front-end ID verification tool by returning\
      \ ID scoring information, including flagging of false and synthetic identities;\
      \ this solution includes a cross-match to the SSA’s Death Master File.\n•\t\

    \ of the top root causes of UI improper payments.\n\nThe Department places a heightened\
    \ priority on overall UI program integrity and mitigating UI fraud risks.  The\
    \ UI system has been, and continues to be, targeted by sophisticated and organized\
    \ fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations.  The\
    \ frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically ID fraud, against state\
    \ UC programs increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.  State UI\
    \ systems were overwhelmed by record numbers of claims amidst an unprecedented\
    \ increase in unemployment triggered by the public health crisis.  When Congress\
    \ created new temporary unemployment programs (some of which lacked basic program\
    \ integrity controls designed to prevent improper payments, including fraud) and\
    \ enacted laws to expedite the delivery of benefits, states were expected to rapidly\
    \ implement and administer these new programs. The combination of decades of underfunding,\
    \ outdated state UI IT systems, record claims volumes, and weaker integrity controls\
    \ in 2020, provided an opportunity for criminals to exploit vulnerabilities in\
    \ state UI systems, which resulted in elevated rates of improper payments. Serious\
    \ underfunding and outdated technology systems limited states’ responsiveness\
    \ and efficiency.  While states worked tirelessly to rapidly combat relentless\
    \ fraud attacks, the fraud schemes continue to evolve to circumvent many of the\
    \ prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by states.  \n\nIn\
    \ FY 2023, states continued to address elevated levels of backlogs caused from\
    \ the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. States continue to focus their attention\
    \ and available resources on reducing backlogs accumulated from high claims volume\
    \ and combatting the substantial increases in UI fraud.  Many states continue\
    \ implementing new or updating existing fraud prevention and detection tools,\
    \ including ID verification solutions and services.\n\nETA has actively and aggressively\
    \ continued to address fraud and improper payments in the UC programs by providing\
    \ support to states through guidance, technical assistance, and additional funding\
    \ opportunities. ETA continues to prioritize UI program integrity as a top agency\
    \ priority. ETA also continues to evolve and oversee implementation of improper\
    \ payment reduction and fraud mitigation strategies that target the highest root\
    \ causes of improper payments and address emerging and evolving risks. For more\
    \ details on ETA’s FY 2023 UI program integrity actions see the FY 2023 UI Integrity\
    \ Strategic Plan available at https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/integrity_plan.asp.\n\
    \nThe Department’s ETA bases the UI improper payment estimates on results of the\
    \ Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) survey, which examines a nationwide statistically\
    \ valid sample of payments made in the three largest permanently authorized Unemployment\
    \ Compensation (UC) programs: State UI, Unemployment Compensation for Federal\
    \ Employees (UCFE), and Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members (UCX).\
    \ The BAM sample does not include payments made under episodic programs such as\
    \ Extended Benefits (EB) and temporary programs like the Emergency Unemployment\
    \ Compensation (EUC) program and the UI-related programs created by the Coronavirus\
    \ Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020, including Pandemic Unemployment\
    \ Assistance (PUA), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), and Federal\
    \ Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC). However, after discussion with OMB,\
    \ ETA has applied the regular UI improper payment rate to the FPUC and PEUC benefit\
    \ outlays since FY 2021 to help ensure transparent, timely reporting. FPUC and\
    \ PEUC expired in law on September 6, 2021, though many states ended these benefits\
    \ before that date. The Department has continued to include PEUC in regular UI\
    \ program reporting in FY 2023. PEUC net outlays of $33 million consist of wind-down\
    \ operations. DOL is including in its OMB Payment Integrity DataCall responses\
    \ the negative amount of outlays in FPUC (negative $82 million) to provide transparency\
    \ for this high-profile pandemic program. The negative value reflects the impact\
    \ of states recovering overpayments and reconciling accounts that exceed payouts\
    \ for the reporting period for this expired pandemic-related benefit. These recovery\
    \ audit recoveries will be reflected in the OMB Data Call’s Agency wide Survey\
    \ per the guidance received. This negative net outlay was not used to artificially\
    \ reduce normal UI program reported outlays or IP estimates."
  rap5: ETA has not determined a tolerable rate. Setting a tolerable rate will need
    to take the states' operations into account. The National overpayment, unknown,
    and underpayment rates (improper payments) are driven on the processes and performance
    of the states. During the pandemic, states transitioned experienced staff from
    their normal duties to assist with the unprecedented claims volume to operate
    the regular UI programs as well as implementing and administering the temporary
    pandemic programs authorized by the CARES act. Other factors that prevented states
    from reducing improper payments include such factors such as outdated IT systems,
    loss of experienced staff, new inexperience staff, and the reduction of administrative
    funding, which significantly impacted resources and staffing level.
  rap6: The FY 2024 President’s Budget request proposes a comprehensive package of
    provisions designed to provide new and expanded tools and controls for states
    to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers are properly paid and to prevent
    fraud and improper payments in the UI system.  This includes a number of provisions
    to improve the administration and integrity of the UI program. The budget submission
    includes requested increases in UI National Activities funding for program integrity
    and anti-fraud activities to support ID verification services in the states, and
    funding to support technology modernization that will improve States’ abilities
    to detect and prevent fraud and other improper payments in the program.
  rnp3: "All of ETA’s UI integrity strategies are focused on reducing the top root\
    \ causes of improper payments and mitigating fraud risks in the UC programs. ETA\
    \ will continue to develop new and update existing integrity strategies to address\
    \ the top root causes of UI improper payments and emerging fraud risks.\n\nETA\
    \ will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of UI integrity strategies, document\
    \ best practices, and provide guidance and technical assistance to states to improve\
    \ UI program operations and reduce improper payments. ETA will continue to align\
    \ UI fraud risk management activities with the leading practices in GAO's Fraud\
    \ Risk Framework and strive to meet the Department’s “low” risk tolerance by continuing\
    \ to assess program risks and employ strategies to further reduce improper payments\
    \ and fraud in the UC programs.\n\nETA will continue to ensure UI program integrity\
    \ remains a top agency priority. The Department will regularly assess and update\
    \ its antifraud and improper payment reduction strategies and continuously evolve\
    \ strategies and antifraud controls to combat emerging fraud schemes and address\
    \ the highest residual risks identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile.  As new\

    Description_Action_Taken: "In its FY 2025 budget submission, the Department proposed\
      \ a comprehensive package of provisions designed to provide new and expanded\
      \ tools and controls for states to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers\
      \ are properly paid and to prevent fraud and improper payments in the UI system.\
      \ The package includes the following components:\n\n•\tRequire states to use\
      \ system(s) designated by the Secretary for cross-matching claimants to prevent\
      \ and detect improper payments, including fraud, which would currently include\
      \ the IDH.\n\n•\tRequire states to use system(s) designated by the Secretary\
      \ for electronic transmission of requests for information relating to UC and\
      \ the provision of such information between the state UI agency and employers\
      \ or their agents, which would currently include SIDES.\n\n•\tRequire states\
      \ to cross-match against the NDNH to better identify individuals continuing\
      \ to claim UC after returning to work, which is one of the leading root causes\
      \ of UI improper payments.\n\n•\tRequire states to cross-match with a system(s)\
      \ designated by the Secretary that contains information on individuals who are\
      \ incarcerated, such as the Social Security Administration’s PUPS or other systems\
      \ for crossmatching incarceration data. This should result in increased prevention\
      \ and detection of improper and fraudulent payments. \n\n•\tRequire states to\
      \ disclose information to the DOL-OIG to conduct audits and investigations to\
      \ discover fraud, waste, and abuse or inefficiencies in the UC programs.\n\n\
      •\tProvide the Secretary with meaningful enforcement authority and the ability\
      \ to reward good performance. This proposal would create a new remedy so that\
      \ instead of withholding a state’s entire administrative grant for failing to\
      \ meet the performance measures or achieve minimum technology standards, the\
      \ Secretary can require a portion of the state’s administrative grant be used\
      \ to correct failing performance and/or have the state participate in required\
      \ technical assistance activities offered by the Department.\n\n•\tAllow states\
      \ to retain up to five percent of recovered fraudulent UI overpayments for program\
      \ integrity use.\n•\tRequire states to use penalty and interest collections\
      \ solely for UI administration.\n\n•\tAllow states the authority to issue a\
      \ formal warning when claimants are unclear on the work search requirements.\n\
      \n•\tAllow states to use contract support in recovery efforts under the Treasury\
      \ Offset Program (TOP).\n\nThe Department issued a UI Transformation Plan (Building\
      \ Resilience: A plan to transform unemployment insurance) on April 5, 2024.\
      \  The plan included a compilation of legislative reforms needed to support\
      \ transformation of the UI system. See Appendix III of the plan  https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/transformation_plan.asp.\
      \ \n\nFurthermore, the ETA is in the process of making changes to the UI confidentiality\
      \ regulations at 20 CFR Part 603, to address the issue of requiring states to\
      \ provide the DOL-OIG with access to state UI data, including for investigations\
      \ and audit purposes.\n\n"

    \ In addition to reducing improper payments and combatting fraud, other ETA top\
    \ priorities include providing timely guidance, technical assistance, and oversight\
    \ to states related to proper administration of all UC programs.\n\nState onboarding\
    \ to use the IDH continued to increase in FY 2024. Enhancements made to the IDH\
    \ helped states more effectively prioritize IDH results, provided states with\
    \ better data analytics to streamline their investigative efforts, and offered\

  act17_3: "In FY 2024 the Department completely aligned existing UI fraud risk management\
    \ activities with the leading practices provided in the GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework\
    \ and the leading practices are thoroughly embedded in the daily UI integrity\
    \ work. Through the development of a UI Fraud Risk Profile, the Department further\
    \ strengthened an organizational culture that views the creation, evaluation,\
    \ monitoring, and evolution of risk mitigation strategies as an ongoing process.\
    \ The Department updates, oversees, and communicates the UI antifraud strategies\
    \ through its dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan, which continuously evolves\
    \ and includes antifraud strategies and integrity controls to combat the highest\
    \ residual risks identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile and further reduce the\
    \ top root causes of improper payments. As new fraud threats emerge, the Department\
    \ updates the UI Fraud Risk Profile and ensures any new antifraud strategies and\
    \ improper payment controls are incorporated and tracked in the UI Integrity Strategic\
    \ Plan. Whenever an antifraud strategy/improper payment control is fully implemented,\
    \ the Department assesses is effectiveness. If the strategy/control proves to\
    \ be effective, the Department reevaluates the priority level ranking of the risk\
    \ and if the risk falls within the Department’s established tolerance level, management\
    \ determines if the residual risk warrants further priority and decides if additional\
    \ or new strategies/controls are necessary to further reduce the risk. \n\nSince\
    \ the UI program is funded and administered through a Federal-state partnership,\
    \ both the Department and state UI agencies have a vested interest in ensuring\
    \ UI program integrity and are jointly responsible for managing the process of\
    \ assessing and mitigating fraud risks to the UI programs, reducing improper payments,\
    \ and prioritizing payment integrity activities.  In FY 2024, the Department developed\
    \ and published UI fraud risk management webpages on the WorkforceGPS UI Community\
    \ of Practice, to remind states of their UI fraud risk management responsibilities\
    \ and to communicate national identified fraud risks to state UI programs (see\
    \ TEN No. 32-23). Also, in the FY 2025 SQSP guidance, ETA required states to report\
    \ in their IAP the state’s actions to evaluate UI fraud risks and implement and\
    \ maintain sufficient controls to effectively prevent fraud and reduce improper\
    \ payments, including the state progress in developing their own state-specific\
    \ antifraud strategies (see UIPL No. 16-24). To helps support state with UI fraud\
    \ risk management and the development of state-specific antifraud strategies,\
    \ the Department requested the UI Integrity Center to develop a program to provide\
    \ such support.  As a result, in FY 2024 the UI Integrity Center created and launched\
    \ a UI Anti-fraud Strategic Planning Service, which is designed to help states\
    \ develop an internal assessment and mitigation strategies to reduce fraud risks\
    \ in the UI program.  \n\nETA will continue building on its work from FY 2024\

    cyp2_1: 'The state agency identified an issue but did not properly follow procedures
      or complete required forms and/or provided incorrect information or did not
      resolve the issue(s). Alternatively, the issue could have been the result of
      a third-party error/incorrect information.


      In addition, these issues may involve instances where the state agency was resolving
      the error or had detected the error as a result of a crossmatch with National
      Directory of New Hire (NDNH) or wage records and an issue was detected after
      the payment was issued.


      State agencies operate the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. Thus, overpayments
      originate from state agency administration issues and are not within the Federal
      agency’s control. Report headings referring to activities “within the agency’s
      control” reflect matters within state agencies’ control.

    cyp4_1: "The UI program is a unique federal-state partnership based on Federal\
      \ law but administered through individual state laws by 53 state UI agencies.\
      \ States vary in their information technology (IT) systems, level of automation,\
      \ staffing capacity, and methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and\
      \ recovery of improper payments and fraud. Additionally, no two states' written\
      \ laws, regulations, and policies specifying eligibility conditions are identical,\
      \ and differences in these conditions influence the potential for error and\
      \ improper payments. Two states could have identical laws but may interpret\
      \ them quite differently. States with stringent or complex provisions tend to\
      \ have higher improper payment rates than those with simpler, more straightforward\
      \ provisions.\n\nFurthermore, Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (SSA)\
      \ requires UI payments to be made “when due” and, once a person is determined\
      \ eligible, this law prohibits states from suspending payments until an official\
      \ determination has been made that payments are no longer due. This statutory\
      \ factor requires states to make payments that may later be determined as improper\
      \ as a result of obtaining new information. For good policy reasons, states\
      \ must continue paying benefits until due process occurs (notice and an opportunity\
      \ for a hearing is provided before benefit payments are stopped). This UI program\
      \ structural feature is a primary driver for top root causes of UI improper\
      \ payments.  Moreover, unlike many other benefit programs, eligibility for UI\
      \ benefits is determined on a weekly basis.  There are more opportunities to\
      \ make errors and for improper payments to be created.  \n"
  pro1: "In June 2022, in recognition of the UI system’s challenges (both before and\
    \ during the pandemic), the GAO added “the UI system to its list of federal areas\
    \ at ‘High Risk’ for waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of broad-based\
    \ transformation” and recommended that the Department “develop and implement a\
    \ plan for transforming UI that meets GAO's high-risk criteria for transformations”.\
    \ In response, the Department developed a comprehensive, strategic approach to\
    \ improving the future integrity of the UI system by directing ARPA funds and\
    \ Department-provided supports directly to states to address fraud prevention\
    \ and UI system modernization. \n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Department released a\
    \ comprehensive UI Transformation Plan, Building Resilience: A comprehensive plan\
    \ to transform unemployment insurance at https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/transformation_plan.asp.\
    \  This plan provides insights into the lessons learned throughout the pandemic\
    \ and represents an accounting of activities and strategies completed, underway,\
    \ and being pursued by the Department, along with recommendations for necessary\
    \ legislative action. \n\nThe Department takes its oversight of federally funded\
    \ programs very seriously. Strengthening UI program integrity, by reducing improper\
    \ payments and mitigating fraud risks, remains a top priority for the Department.\
    \ The Department’s UI Transformation Plan and UI Integrity Strategic Plan both\
    \ contain numerous corrective actions and strategies to address improper payments\
    \ and combat fraud.  The Department remains committed to reducing the UI improper\
    \ payment rate and coming into compliance with the requirements set forth in PIIA,\
    \ by supporting states with payment accuracy and fraud prevention.  \n"
  rap5: While the Department has determined a fraud risk tolerance level for the UI
    program, OUI has not yet determined an IP tolerable rate for this program. Setting
    a tolerable rate will need to take the states' operations into account. The National
    overpayment, unknown, and underpayment rates (improper payments) are driven on
    the processes and performance of the states. During the pandemic, states transitioned
    experienced staff from their normal duties to assist with the unprecedented claims
    volume to operate the regular UI programs as well as implementing and administering
    the temporary pandemic UI programs. Other factors that prevented states from reducing
    improper payments include such factors such as outdated IT systems, loss of experienced
    staff, new inexperience staff, and the reduction of administrative funding, which
    significantly impacted resources and staffing level. A "tolerable rate baseline"
    couldn't be derived during the historic spike in claims during the Pandemic. As
    the program enters a post-pandemic environment, OUI can begin to examine a baseline
    to determine a tolerable rate
  rap6: The FY 2025 President’s Budget request proposes a comprehensive package of
    provisions designed to provide new and expanded tools and controls for states
    to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers are properly paid and to prevent
    fraud and improper payments in the UI system. This includes a number of provisions
    to improve the administration and integrity of the UI program. The budget submission
    includes requested increases in UI administrative funding, UI National Activities
    funding for program integrity and anti-fraud activities to support ID verification
    services in the states, and funding to support technology modernization that will
    improve states’ abilities to detect and prevent fraud and other improper payments
    in the program.
  rnp3: The Department will continue to provide legislative technical assistance on
    proposed UI Integrity legislation as needed and promote the Department’s UI integrity
    legislative package as set out in the FY 2025 budget proposal. In addition, ETA
    will continue its progress to make changes to the UI confidentiality regulations
    at 20 CFR Part 603, that would, in part, address the issue of providing the DOL-OIG
    with access to state UI data, including for investigations and audit.
  rnp4: "ETA continues to hold managers and states accountable for reduction of improper\
    \ payments and recovery of overpayments. 53 states (including Puerto Rico, US\
    \ Virgin Islands, and Washington D.C.) administer the UI program and set priorities\
    \ within available resources. ETA uses performance measures to evaluate states’\
    \ UI operations and has established an FY 2025 Agency Priority Goal to reduce\
    \ the UI improper payment rate. States are also required to report illegal/fraudulent\
    \ activity to the DOL-OIG (see UIPL No. 04-17). ETA and the UI Integrity Center\
    \ support states to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments and combat\
    \ fraud. ETA requires states to conduct overpayment detection and recovery activities,\
    \ and BAM units conduct investigations to assess payment accuracy. ETA uses BAM\
    \ improper payment data to assess UI program risks and develop mitigation strategies.\
    \ \n\nAdditionally, the Department completely aligned its UI fraud risk management\
    \ activities with the leading practices in GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework. The UI\
    \ program has internal controls in place and continues to enhance these resources\
    \ to deter improper payments and fraud. ETA’s UI Integrity Strategic Plan addresses\
    \ the top root causes of improper payments and outlines integrity actions and\
    \ antifraud strategies to support states in reducing improper payments and mitigating\
    \ fraud risks.\n\nFurthermore, development, delivery, and/or implementation of\
    \ these initiatives by managers and states is outlined in ETA’s annual Agency\
    \ Management Plan. Annual performance standards for managers reference strategies\
    \ and include the completion of the activities/milestones below:\n\n•\tSQSP process\
    \ requires states to submit IAPs to identify state-specific root causes, strategies\
    \ to address each root cause, and CAPs if the improper payment rate is above 10%.\n\
    \n•\tProvide annual funding and direction, and partner with the UI Integrity Center\
    \ to provide tools, training, and technical assistance to implement innovative\
    \ strategies to prevent, detect and reduce improper payments and fraud.\n\n•\t\
    Ensure states conduct annual the BAM survey to measure improper payments and root\
    \ causes. ETA reviews BAM state data for validity, analyzes trends, and makes\
    \ data available at: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/unemployment-insurance-payment-accuracy/data.\
    \ \n \n•\tMonitor progress on the performance measures that states must meet.\n\
    \n•\tStates failing to meet performance criteria are required to submit annual\
    \ CAPs that include strategies to improve state performance. ETA’s oversight process\
    \ includes quarterly reviews on CAP milestones and updates; triennial peer reviews\
    \ for BAM, Appeals, and Benefits Timeliness and Quality; and enhanced quarterly\
    \ monitoring and technical assistance to states with a high improper payment rate\
    \ or chronic poor performance.\n"
