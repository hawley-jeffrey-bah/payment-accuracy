  pro1: For the FY2022 reporting cycle, FCC concluded, with OMB consultation, that
    it would be best if the Universal Service Fund - High Cost program to remain in
    Phase 1 in FY 2022 reporting cycle until OIG recommended revised testing procedures
    could be fully tested in order to determine the most accurate improper payment
    rate.  FCC did not want to mislead any users of this information before our new
    testing procedures was fully completed.  As OMB is very well aware, the High Cost
    program itself is very complex.  To comply with new OIG recommendations in our
    testing to determine the most accurate improper payment rate, it has taken significantly
    more time than we had originally anticipated.  At this juncture, FCC is comfortable
    that the new transaction testing will be completed within next few months, which
    will allow us to provide a more accurate improper payment rate for the High Cost
    program in the FY 2023 reporting cycle.  As stated above, when FCC made this determination,
    we consulted OMB and OMB informed us that FCC could use a testing period longer
    than 12-month similar to what other agencies have been doing.  Based on our actual
    experience of testing the new OIG recommended procedures, testing is definitely
    taking longer to complete.  As a result, the FCC determined it should use a 18-month
    reporting cycle for the High Cost program.  We’ll see if we can reduce the testing
    period as we gain more experience with the new testing procedures.

  act17_1: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, will continue to implement an Improper
    Payment Analysis process. Through this process, USAC management performs an analysis
    of its improper payments to understand the root cause and to identify corrective
    actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with USAC management, the USAC’s
    Fraud Risk Group will continue to evaluate common root causes in an effort to
    identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is needed.
  act17_2: USAC, in collaboration with the FCC, will continue to effectively implement
    and prioritize strategies to reduce the improper payments. USAC will continue
    to increase program efforts focused on keeping the policies and procedures updated
    along with training materials. We will continue to review the strategies to ensure
    adequate impact to the improper payments.
  act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue to
    review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
    accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
    improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
    a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
    identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is needed.
    This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective actions
    as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future instances
    of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly review process
    to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.

    data validation for legacy funds. The annual Circle of Life webinar references
    FCC rules and provides common error examples and recommends best practices to
    avoid these findings.  The monthly NECA meeting is used by High Cost to evaluate
    processes based on audit finding feedback. With the annual data validation, High
    Cost compares projected and actual cost study data that determines carriers' support.
    The High Cost Program team will introduce a new compliance layer by developing
    additional PIA procedures leveraging enhanced analytics and testing capabilities
    on a sample basis to identify potential violations.
  rnp4: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are the known as Beneficiary and Contributor
    Audit Program (BCAP). BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments that must
    be recaptured, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste, fraud, and abuse.
    USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as Payment

    Quality Assurance (PQA). Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling methodology
    to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC, USF-LL, USF-RHC,
    and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is to estimate an improper
    payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules. To recover improper
    payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery policy to standardize the
    reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC improper payments are deemed
    collectible and USAC has either recovered or is in the process of recovering the
    improper payments.'
