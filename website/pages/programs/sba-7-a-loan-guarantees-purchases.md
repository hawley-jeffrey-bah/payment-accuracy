  cyp20_2: The estimated rate of 4.15 percent improper payments and 0.07 percent in
    unknown payments totals 4.22 percent.  Because the lower bound of its confidence
    interval, 1.76 percent, is lower than the reduction target rate of 3.25 percent,
    in accordance with OMB Appendix C to Circular A-123 (March 2021), the 7(a) loan
    guaranty purchase program is considered to have met its reduction target. For
    FY 2023, the SBA established a reduction target of 4.05 percent for the 7(a) loan
    guaranty purchases program.
