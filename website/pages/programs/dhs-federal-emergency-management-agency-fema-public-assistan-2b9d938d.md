  rap5: Program is reflective of disaster supplemental funding that was received by
    DHS to respond to the Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters that occurred
    in the 2017 / 2018 timeframe. Due to the burden of testing and reporting, Disaster
    Supplemental Funding programs are tested and reported two years in arrears. As
    such, by the time that remedial action is taken and/or is realized in the PIIA
    testing results, the total value of annual disbursements is expected to be below
    the threshold for PIIA action. DHS will continue to make process and internal
    control improvements to improve the payment management processes as it relates
    to supplemental funding but feels that internal control, human capital, information
    system, and infrastructure needs have been met.
  rnp3: FEMA Leadership prioritizes the annual PIIA assessments and has high expectations
    of reducing IPs and UPs. FEMA Leadership stresses the importance of being a good
    steward of taxpayer dollars which is trickled down the FEMA levels of hierarchy.
    Root cause analyses are performed at the completion of PIIA testing for each program
    which are used a basis for creating the respective MAPs as well as improving the
    respective internal control environments. Overall, the IPs and UPs are decreasing.
    Additionally, FEMA will be conducting training and require routine meetings with
    stakeholders as needed.

      However, FEMA has direct oversight over drawdown activity for the program in
      order to support the payment or reimbursement to the state and local entities.
      As such, DHS believes that all payments disbursed, as reviewed through the drawdown
      activity reviewed under PIIA, are within the agency's control. Therefore, all
      resulting improper payments, to include overpayments, have also been determined
      to be within the control of the agency.

  pro1: "The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as Amended\
    \ (Stafford Act), Title 42 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) § 5121 et seq.,\
    \ authorizes the President to provide federal assistance when the magnitude of\
    \ an incident or threatened incident exceeds the affected State, Territorial,\
    \ Indian Tribal, and local government capabilities to respond or recover.\n\n\
    The purpose of the PA Grant Program is to support communities’ recovery from major\
    \ disasters by providing them with grant assistance for debris removal, life-saving\
    \ emergency protective measures, and restoring public infrastructure. Local governments,\
    \ states, tribes, territories and certain private nonprofit organizations are\
    \ eligible to apply. Public Assistance is FEMA's largest grant program and provides\
    \ emergency assistance to save lives and protect property and assists communities\
    \ with repairing public infrastructure affected by federally declared incidents.\n\
    \nFEMA implemented the VAYGo pilot program to test PA and certain other disaster\
    \ grant expenditure, originally scoped to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\
    \ Since these disasters, the VAYGo program has expanded to include coverage over\
    \ additional disaster declarations, such as COVID response. As part of VAYGo,\
    \ FEMA reviews project documentation for a sample of funds as they are drawn down\
    \ by recipients and conducts testing to verify whether the project funding was\
    \ appropriately expended by the subrecipient. One goal of VAYGo is to identify\
    \ potential problems earlier, allowing FEMA and recipients—including PA recipients—to\
    \ correct or mitigate issues earlier in the process instead of waiting until grant\
    \ closeout. According to FEMA officials that conduct the testing, the primary\
    \ goal of VAYGo is to test for ineligible costs, which can serve as a gateway\
    \ for the agency to be on notice of issues of fraud, waste, or abuse in the PA\
    \ program. \n\nWhile error rates remain above the OMB thresholds to be considered\
    \ susceptible to significant improper payments, the associated Public Assistance\
    \ payments as monitored by VAYGo have seen substantial improvements. FEMA is confident\
    \ the IPs and UPs error rates will continue to improve, as the VAYGo program continues\
    \ to mature and the ongoing collaboration and training of internal and external\
    \ VAYGo stakeholders continues."
  rap5: DHS has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and
    information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown
    payments to the tolerable rate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
    - Public Assistance - VAYGo program.
  rap6: N/A - DHS did not request additional resources in the most recent budget submission
    of the agency.
  rnp3: The root causes of the IPs and UPs have consistently remained the same with
    UPs accounting for 80% to 90% of the overall reported questioned costs.  FEMA
    continues to work with Recipients on obtaining additional information and missing
    documentation for the UPs.  These efforts and the collaboration to strengthen
    internal controls with internal and external VAYGo stakeholders have led to continuous
    decrease of IPs and UPs. The IPs have improved by approximately 40% and the UPs
    have improved by approximately 80% over the last three VAYGo testing cycles.  FEMA
    is confident the IPs and UPs error rates will continue to improve as the VAYGo
    program continues to mature, ongoing collaboration continues, and continuous training
    of internal and external VAYGo stakeholders is held.

    Description_Action_Taken: "To help meet the goals of the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan,\
      \ the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reestablished the Public Assistance\
      \ Steering Committee (PASC). The committee is an advisory group of state, territorial,\
      \ tribal and local (STTL) government representatives and FEMA region representatives\
      \ designed to help improve the Public Assistance program processes for customers–recipients\
      \ and applicants. The committee first convened in 2017 to provide real-world\
      \ partner perspectives, inform strategic program changes and discuss overall\
      \ program improvements. The re-established committee convened in 2022–post COVID-19.\
      \ With the re-establishment of the PASC in 2022, FEMA formally set the membership\
      \ to be comprised of a SLTT representative from each region and increased engagement\
      \ with the annual Public Assistance Working Session (PAWS). FEMA continues to\
      \ work with the PASC and has leveraged the committee to complete the following:\n\
      •\tIn March 2022, FEMA made the first changes based on recommendations to help\
      \ speed recovery efforts and reduce applicant burdens.\n•\tIn September 2022,\
      \ FEMA took these additional steps to streamline Public Assistance.\n•\tIn March\
      \ 2023, FEMA released a Memo, “Simplifying the Public Assistance Program – Management\
      \ Costs”, to further streamline Public Assistance as it relates to Management\
      \ Costs documentation for force account labor. \n\nThe national emergency declaration\
      \ related to the COVID-19 disaster activated FEMA’s Public Assistance program\
      \ and created opportunities for collaboration and funding at all levels of government,\
      \ ensuring that these resources reached individuals with the greatest needs\
      \ requires concerted effort and advocacy at the local, state, and national levels.\
      \ FEMA created a streamlined Public Assistance Direct Application process to\
      \ address the COVID-19 pandemic and scale the Public Assistance Program to ensure\
      \ eligible applicants receive funding quickly. The Direct Application process\
      \ allowed applicants to submit a COVID-19 Streamlined Project Application directly\
      \ through Grants Portal without a Program Delivery Manager (PDMG) assigned.\
      \ Through the Direct Application process, applicants can claim costs for Debris\
      \ Removal (Category A), Emergency Protective Measures (Category B), and Management\
      \ Costs (Category Z) using a Streamlined Project Application (SPA). Stakeholder\
      \ feedback reported that this streamlined process was effective because FEMA\

      \ FEMA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer conducted thirteen listening\
      \ sessions early in fiscal year (FY) 2023 with FEMA Regions and Recipients to\
      \ better understand the Public Assistance program and to identify common VAYGo\
      \ issues and recommendations for improvements in the VAYGo program. The outcomes\

      \ FEMA Grants Program Directorate, Regions, and Recipients. The Guide encompasses\
      \ improvements and standardization to VAYGo testing, identifies roles/responsibilities,\
      \ documentation requirements, and enhances communication with Regions and Recipients.\
      \ As a result of those listening sessions, FEMA published the VAYGo Guide and\

      \ and FEMA scheduled to visit Region VIII (FEMA Region VIII supports Colorado,\
      \ Utah, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota) in FY 2024. VAYGo\
      \ HQ also supported the Public Assistance Working Session (PAWS) in May 2023\
      \ and provided VAYGo training to roughly 100 Regional and Recipient Public Assistance\
      \ stakeholders. \n\nPublic Assistance - VAYGo hosted periodic meetings with\
      \ recipients as part of the VAYGo remediation efforts for outstanding Improper\
      \ Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs). Through these ongoing meetings\
      \ and the collection of information and documentation, VAYGo has continued to\

      \ the UPs. \n\nThese efforts and the collaboration to strengthen internal controls\
      \ with internal and external VAYGo stakeholders have led to a continuous decrease\
      \ of improper payments. For FY 2020 disbursement activity (reported in 2022)\
      \ FEMA reported an overpayment error rate of 1.09 percent. Based on the FY 2021\

  act17_1: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to train staff
    on proper procedures for making Public Assistance payments that would fall under
    the scope of the Validate as You Go (VAYGo) oversight. Planned corrective actions
    in fiscal year (FY) 2025 will continue to focus on automation of manual processes,
    training staff and state/local personnel, and conducting regular testing to ensure
    documentation completeness, accuracy, and validity. In FY 2025, the main focus
    will be on sustaining educational efforts and sharing interim directives and reimbursement
    package requirements with Regional, state, and local partners. FEMA is confident
    that the Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) error rates will improve
    as the VAYGo program continues to mature and ongoing collaboration and continuous
    training of internal and external VAYGo stakeholders is sustained.
  act17_2: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance payment
    appropriateness is heavily reliant on state and local entities and the relationship
    that they have with vendors. As noted previously, the main focus will be on sustaining
    educational efforts and sharing interim directives and reimbursement package requirements
    with Regional, state, and local partners. FEMA will continue to work with Recipients
    on obtaining additional information and missing documentation for the Unknown
    Payments (UPs). These efforts and the collaboration to strengthen internal controls
    with internal and external Validate as You Go (VAYGo) stakeholders have been successful
    in the past and have led to continuous decrease of overpayments. FEMA is confident
    that the continuation of these efforts will have a positive impact on the reduction
    of UPs going forward as well.
  act17_3: "Public Assistance events that are determined to be of higher risk are\
    \ scoped in for Validate as You Go (VAYGo) oversight and monitoring. As this continues\
    \ to gain scope and mature to a more sustained timeframe for review, Improper\
    \ Payments (IPs) should be prevented and/or detected in a timelier manner for\
    \ resolution by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA is confident\
    \ the IP and Unknown Payment (UP) error rates will improve as the VAYGo program\
    \ continues to mature and returns to a more 'real-time' execution approach. This\
    \ will continue to entail FEMA's commitment to ongoing collaboration and continuous\
    \ training of internal and external VAYGo stakeholders. \n\nFor fiscal year (FY)\
    \ 2020 disbursement activity (reported in 2022) FEMA reported an overpayment error\
    \ rate of 1.09 percent. Based on the FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity\
    \ (consolidated for reporting in 2024), the overpayment error rate has been improved\

  pro1: "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance program\
    \ provides supplemental grants to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments,\
    \ and certain types of private non-profits so communities can quickly respond\
    \ to and recover from major disasters or emergencies. After an event like a hurricane,\
    \ tornado, earthquake or wildfire, communities need help to cover their costs\
    \ for debris removal, life-saving emergency protective measures, and restoring\
    \ public infrastructure. FEMA provides this assistance based on authority in statutes,\
    \ executive orders (EOs), regulations, and policies. The four basic components\
    \ of eligibility are applicant, facility, work and cost.\n•\tAn applicant must\
    \ be a state, territory, tribe, local government or private nonprofit organization.\n\
    •\tA facility must be a building, public works system, equipment or natural feature.\n\
    •\tWork is categorized as either \"emergency\" or \"permanent.\" It must be required\
    \ as a result of the declared incident, located within the designated disaster\
    \ area, and is the legal responsibility of the applicant.\n•\tCost is the funding\
    \ tied directly to eligible work, and must be adequately documented, authorized,\
    \ necessary and reasonable. Eligible costs include labor, equipment, materials,\
    \ contract work, as well as direct and indirect administrative costs. \n\nIn 2019,\
    \ FEMA implemented the Validate as You Go (VAYGo) Public Assistance grants payments\
    \ review process for major disaster declarations resulting from the Harvey, Irma,\
    \ and Maria disasters, to comply with statutory improper payment review and reporting\
    \ requirements to significantly reduce project closeout documentation requirements\
    \ for recipients with proven effective internal control processes. In December\
    \ 2020, FEMA expanded VAYGo to all Public Assistance and Fire Management Assistance\
    \ Grants major disasters and emergency declarations beginning with disasters declared\
    \ in fiscal year 2020. \n\nFEMA began using information provided in FEMA Grants\
    \ Manager, Grants Portal, and Emergency Management Mission Integrated Environment\
    \ (EMMIE) to review documentation and information provided on Public Assistance\
    \ Projects. VAYGo’s goal is to improve grants management internal control processes\
    \ by consistently assessing payment error rates to identify potential payment\
    \ integrity issues. VAYGo payment integrity testing results allows recipients\
    \ to remediate questioned costs and take appropriate actions to strengthen internal\
    \ controls in grant lifecycle processes. This will prevent or reduce the likelihood\
    \ of future improper payments. The program intends to strengthen grants management\
    \ internal controls while decreasing the complexity and burden of the grants management\
    \ process for both FEMA and recipients. \n\nOn March 13, 2020, the Presidential\
    \ declaration of a nationwide COVID-19 emergency increased the level of federal\
    \ response from FEMA, as well as support to State, local, tribal, and territorial\
    \ (SLTT) partners across the nation. The agency’s response to COVID-19 was unprecedented.\
    \ When the White House directed FEMA to lead operations, COVID-19 became the first\
    \ national pandemic response that FEMA has led since it was established in 1979.\
    \ It was also the first time in U.S. history the President declared a nationwide\
    \ emergency under Section 501b of the Stafford Act and authorized Major Disaster\
    \ Declarations for all states and territories for the same incident. FEMA, through\
    \ its 10 Regions, managed 59 concurrent Presidential Major Disaster Declarations\
    \ for COVID-19 and worked with over 91 tribal nations. Since this disaster declaration,\
    \ FEMA alone has obligated over $85 billion in COVID-19 Public Assistance. \n\n\
    In April 2022, FEMA strategically paused the VAYGo program to conduct listening\
    \ sessions and identify ways to improve the VAYGo testing process. VAYGo was reactivated\
    \ on August 9, 2023 to enhance FEMA’s Public Assistance grants management internal\
    \ controls. State, local, tribal and territorial governments now have access to\
    \ a comprehensive VAYGo guide that is key to achieving this goal. This payment\
    \ review process complies with statutory improper payment review and reporting\
    \ requirements, and significantly reduces project closeout documentation requirements\
    \ for recipients with effective internal control processes through the VAYGo Closeout\
    \ Benefit. The closeout benefit will be available to recipients who achieve and\
    \ maintain low error rates during their yearly VAYGo testing cycles for two consecutive\
    \ years. Qualified recipients will not have to submit all the associated financial\
    \ documentation that is required in the standard closeout process, considerably\
    \ streamlining their project lifecycle. The benefit only applies to large projects\
    \ for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and all disasters declared in fiscal\
    \ year 2020 and forward, including COVID-19. \n\nAs the COVID-19 specific disaster\
    \ declaration was so wide reaching and impacted so many individuals, the span\
    \ of the public assistance provided is extensive. In order to sufficiently assess\
    \ the appropriateness of these payments, the request for information is broad\
    \ and often takes a substantial amount of time to obtain the necessary documentation\
    \ and of adequate quality and completeness to enable auditability. Therefore,\
    \ due to the impact of the VAYGo strategic pause as well as the significant increase\
    \ in assessment burden, DHS delayed the PIIA Phase 2 reporting for the FEMA Public\
    \ Assistance VAYGo and did not report in 2024. DHS is pleased to report in 2025\
    \ over a 24-month reporting period to cover assessment work over fiscal year (FY)\
    \ 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity for the program. While the assessment\
    \ results indicate that additional corrective actions and enhancements are needed\
    \ to sufficiently prevent Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UP), the\
    \ reduction in the overpayment error rate published in 2024 (0.34 percent) shows\
    \ improvement over the 2022 published overpayment error rate (1.09 percent). Training\
    \ efforts will continue to heavily focus on obtaining sufficient supporting documentation\
    \ in order to see future improvements on the UP error rate. DHS remains fully\
    \ committed to providing transparent, accurate, and complete reporting and upholding\
    \ payment integrity."
  rap5: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is confident that resourcing
    is sufficient to establish and maintain internal controls, human capital, and
    information system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments (IPs)
    and Unknown Payments (UPs). As a tolerable rate has not yet been established for
    the Public Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program, the level of resourcing
    will be reassessed to an established tolerable rate once the program is fully
    baselined.
  rap6: "No additional resources have been requested specifically as a result of the\
    \ Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) assessment and reporting results.\
    \ Based on the timing and identification of the Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown\
    \ Payment (UP) error rate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public\
    \ Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program, the fiscal year (FY) 2025 Budget\
    \ request had already been developed. FEMA is confident that the resourcing already\
    \ requested and included in the FY 2025 Budget, examples noted below, is sufficient\
    \ to establish and maintain internal controls, human capital, and information\
    \ system and other infrastructure to reduce IPs and UPs. \n\nFEMA continues to\
    \ implement its mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters.\
    \ The agency has carried out this mission and helped communities across the Nation\
    \ respond to natural hazards and emergencies. FEMA has learned that emergency\
    \ management is a shared responsibility among the whole community, where disaster\
    \ operations are federally supported, State managed, and locally executed. The\
    \ FY 2025 Budget request continues investments in implementing this framework\
    \ and advances priorities established by the Administration. Additionally, the\
    \ FEMA Administrator has identified three goals critical to the Agency’s mission\
    \ aligned with leadership’s vision for emergency management: \n\n1.\tInstill Equity\
    \ as a Foundation of Emergency Management\n•\tCultivate a FEMA that prioritizes\
    \ and harnesses a diverse workforce\n•\tRemove barriers to FEMA programs through\
    \ a people first approach\n•\tAchieve equitable outcomes for those that FEMA serves\n\
    \n2.\tLead Whole of Community in Climate Resilience\n•\tIncrease climate literacy\
    \ among the emergency management community\n•\tBuild a climate resilient nation\n\
    •\tEmpower risk-informed decision making\n\n3.\tPromote and Sustain a Ready FEMA\
    \ and Prepared Nation\n•\tStrengthen the emergency management workforce\n•\tPosture\
    \ FEMA to meet current and emergent threats\n•\tUnify coordination and delivery\
    \ of federal assistance \n\nThe Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the appropriation\
    \ FEMA uses to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery\
    \ efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm\
    \ State and tribal resources pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief\
    \ and Emergency Assistance Act, P.L. 93-288 (as amended), 42 U.S. Code sections\
    \ 5121-5207. Specifically, the DRF can provide funding for Stafford Act declarations\
    \ or activities that include: (1) pre-declaration surge activities; (2) emergency\
    \ declarations; (3) major disaster declarations; (4) fire management assistance\
    \ grants (FMAGs); and (5) Disaster Readiness and Support (DRS) activities. Through\
    \ the DRF, FEMA can authorize Federal disaster support activities as well as eligible\
    \ State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) actions such as emergency protection\
    \ and debris removal. The DRF also funds the repair and rebuilding of eligible\
    \ disaster damaged infrastructure, eligible hazard mitigation projects, financial\
    \ assistance to eligible disaster survivors, and FMAGs for eligible large wildfires.\
    \ In the DHS FY 2025 Budget, FEMA has requested:\n•\tA major disaster allocation\
    \ to address ongoing Stafford Act disasters. The FY 2025 budget request includes\
    \ funding for continued recovery efforts in support of COVID-19, Hurricanes Maria,\
    \ Fiona, and Ian, and other disaster activity. \n\nIn addition, Operations and\
    \ Support (O&S) provides core mission development and maintenance of an integrated,\
    \ nationwide capability to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and recover from\
    \ the consequences of major disasters and emergencies regardless of cause, in\
    \ partnership with other Federal agencies, SLTT governments, volunteer organizations,\
    \ and the private sector. Activities supported by this account incorporate the\
    \ essential command and control functions, mitigate long-term risks, ensure the\
    \ continuity and restoration of essential services and functions and provide leadership\
    \ to build, sustain, and improve the coordination and delivery of support to citizens\
    \ and SLTT governments. In the DHS FY 2025 Budget, FEMA has requested:\n•\tA program\
    \ change to the O&S related to Disaster Workforce Readiness. The increase in staffing\
    \ would provide training and education enhancements for the FEMA Incident Management\
    \ Assistance Team (IMAT) and Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) cadres. The staffing\
    \ increase is for critical and highly specialized positions, closing capability\
    \ gaps and ensuring the Agency is ready to respond to disasters of increasing\
    \ frequency and impacts and meet the need of survivors. Laws such as the Post\
    \ Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, the Post Sandy Recovery Act, and the\
    \ Homeland Security Act of 2002 have set requirements for FEMA to gain and maintain\
    \ capabilities to not only coordinate the Federal family’s ability to provide\
    \ lifesaving and life sustaining resources and activities during disasters, but\
    \ to also be the industry leader in training and education of the emergency management\
    \ field across all levels of society. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and\
    \ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reports and findings have identified where\
    \ FEMA has experienced successes, shortcomings, and gaps in mission delivery and\
    \ have provided recommendations on how and where to apply resources to address\
    \ shortfall. This includes FEMA’s ability to execute the requirements established\
    \ in Section 302 (Coordinating Officers) and Section 303 (Emergency Support and\
    \ Response Teams) of the Stafford Act. Developing and maintaining professional\
    \ development programs for FCOs and IMATs is necessary to advance the Administrator’s\
    \ stated goals for the management and support of FEMA’s field leaders. These requirements,\
    \ both new and with enhancements to existing programs, will enhance the readiness\
    \ of FEMA’s FCO and IMAT cadres and will enable increased Field Leadership capabilities.\n\
    •\tA program change to the O&S related to Grants Management Modernization (GMM).\
    \ The increase in funding would allow for the sustainment of the Grants Management\
    \ Modernization (GMM) Program FEMA Grant Outcomes (FEMA GO), Preparedness Grant\
    \ Systems Portfolio (PGSP), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Environmental\
    \ and Historic Preservation Management Information System (EMIS), and Mitigation\
    \ Electronic Grants (MT-eGrants). With these additional resources FEMA will be\
    \ able to manage risk and implement sufficient controls over the grants that it\
    \ administers as well as provide mission critical services and support to disaster\
    \ survivors, program staff, and stakeholders. Specifically, these resources will\
    \ enable the Legacy Grant Management Systems to provide adequate system’s operation\
    \ and maintenance capabilities to improve the cybersecurity protection for FEMA’s\
    \ intellectual property, including the FEMA GO software, and protect recipient\
    \ data and FEMA data contained in the FEMA GO system. \n\nFor additional detail\
    \ on the DHS FY 2025 Budget, please refer to the DHS.gov website."

    \ balances developing policy, delivering the program, and prioritizing resources\
    \ to maintain an efficient use of resources. FEMA prioritizes resources and effort\
    \ where risk and complexity are high. That means ensuring personnel and technical\
    \ resources are made available, and administrative oversight is more in-depth,\
    \ where a disaster, Applicant, or project represents a higher risk in one or more\
    \ of the four risk areas–Mission, Finances, Program, and Reputation. By contrast,\
    \ FEMA limits level of effort, resources, and administrative oversight where risk\

    \ environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively managing\
    \ improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any improper payments\
    \ that may occur. Management’s efforts, to include within DHS Headquarters as\
    \ well Components, around improper payments are subject to an annual compliance\
    \ review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). These measures are designed\
    \ to hold the appropriate personnel accountable for meeting applicable improper\
    \ payment reduction targets and establishing and maintaining strong internal controls\
    \ around payment management. \n\nDepartment-wide, the goals and requirements for\
    \ strong payment integrity are communicated to all levels of staff throughout\
    \ the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office\
    \ and procurement staff. The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure\
    \ that managers, accountable officers, to include Component Chief Financial Officers\
    \ (CFOs), programs, States, and localities are held accountable for reducing and\
    \ recapturing improper payments. The Department’s CFO and senior staff have incorporated\
    \ improper payment expectations and performance in their annual performance plans.\
    \ \n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regularly engages with recipients\
    \ and process owners in monthly remediation meetings to ensure that appropriate\
    \ accountable officials are actively taking actions to reduce Improper Payments\
    \ (IPs) and identify and categorize Unknown Payment (UP) transactions as either\
    \ proper or improper. If a transaction is deemed proper, no further action is\
    \ taken. If a transaction is deemed technically improper, FEMA requires a corrective\
    \ action be put in place in order resolve issues surrounding procedures, policies,\
    \ and trainings. If a transaction is deemed improper and is associated with monetary\
    \ loss, then the transaction is submitted through the FEMA debt collection process\
    \ including Notice of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset, if applicable.\
    \ \n\nIn addition, FEMA tracks any changes to the program. Training, information\
    \ sharing, and the documentation of new processes will be prioritized. Payment\
    \ management reviews related to Internal Control over Financial Reporting are\
    \ conducted within the DHS control environment each fiscal year accompanied with\
    \ processes to review and examine for improper payments, to include but not limited\
    \ to duplicate payment reviews, card payment reviews, payroll analysis, etc."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: As heavy program fluctuations continued to be seen in the 2024 assessment
    review, covering the fiscal year (FY) 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity,
    the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance - Validate as
    You Go (VAYGo) program will review the 2025 conducted assessment results to better
    determine if the program has stabilized. Per Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
    Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance, based on at least a 24-month reporting
    period, a baseline will be established at that time if no significant changes
    are noted. From the established baseline, the agency will have a more accurate
    basis to establish a tolerable rate. However, based on the intent of the program
    and the program's current relation to a nationwide emergency disaster as well
    as other high- risk disaster declarations, it is expected that the tolerable rate
    will be established at approximately 2.5 percent.

Description: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance program
  provides supplemental grants to state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments,
  and certain types of private non-profits for emergency response and long-term disaster
  recovery efforts. Due to the nature of the Public Assistance program, FEMA is reliant
  on additional parties, such as states, territories, etc., to oversee and execute
  payments on behalf of the program. The barrier related to the expansive COVID disaster
  size and the level of burden to collect the necessary supporting documentation serves
  as a limitation to FEMA in improving the prevention of improper payments due to
  the inability to readily match information related to financial eligibility.
