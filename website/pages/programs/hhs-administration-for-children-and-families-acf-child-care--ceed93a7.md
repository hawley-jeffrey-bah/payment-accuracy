  rap5: CCDF is a block grant that is administered by the states. The reporting of
    national error and improper payment measures in the CCDF program is based on state-specific
    policies. Each state has the flexibility to determine the threshold at which an
    error resulted in an improper payment.  Since CCDF payments occur at the state
    level, information systems and other infrastructure needed to reduce CCDF improper
    payments need to be addressed at the state level. The reported rate, which is
    well below the 10% threshold, is deemed tolerable.
  rnp3: 'HHS attributes the improper payment estimate decrease to HHS’ successful
    multi-pronged approach to supporting states as they continue to experience challenges
    in their efforts to comply with the CCDF reauthorization and related regulations.
    HHS provided technical assistance while also allowing needed flexibility due to
    the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19.   '

  pro1: The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program is a federally funded,
    state-administered block grant program with each state having maximum flexibility
    in developing the CCDF programs and policies that best suit the needs of children
    and families within that state.   States tailor their review of errors to reflect
    the policies and procedures unique to their state and therefore, states have varying
    requirements for establishing and verifying a client’s eligibility.  For this
    reason, there is not a common lexicon for root cause data/eligibility themes across
    states and current CCDF program regulations do not require states to collect and
    report the root cause of errors in pre-determined categories.   The data used
    to calculate and report improper and unknown payments data is collected by the
    states and aggregated at the federal level, and states are not required to report
    dollar amounts associated with individual root causes.  Therefore, while the specific
    root causes of errors and associated corrective actions are identified by each
    reporting state under the policies unique to the state, the errors are consolidated
    into one control cause category for this aggregate reporting at the federal level.
  rap5: 'The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 (CCDBG) and CCDF regulations
    (2016) required states to create and adopt new policies and procedures. State
    grantees have been implementing large-scale changes to their child care programs
    and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)

    anticipated that the improper payment rate could be affected as states work to
    meet the new requirements.  ACF anticipated reestablishing the baseline and setting
    a reduction target in FY 2022, however, limitations and restrictions due to COVID-19
    impacted states’ abilities to complete planned actions as states were

    granted needed flexibility. In addition, the error rate may continue to fluctuate
    as a result of time-limited policies associated with supplemental COVID funding.
    The effects of COVID-19 will continue to impact the improper payment rate in the
    FY 2022 measurement and beyond, making it challenging to establish a baseline,
    develop a tolerable rate, and therefore assess needs with respect to  internal
    controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce
    improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.'
  rap6: The program has not determined a tolerable rate.  Therefore, the program has
    not identified needs with respect to  internal controls, human capital and information
    system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments
    to the tolerable rate.
  rnp3: "Improper payment corrective action plans for the Child Care and Development\
    \ Fund program addresses the specific cause of errors, which at the federal level,\
    \ is typically in the form of targeted training and technical assistance.  For\

  cyp7_ucp3_1: The specific documentation that the state failed to provide for the
    Child Care and Development Fund program varies from state to state.  This is because
    under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have maximum
    flexibility in developing the Child Care and Development Fund  programs and policies
    that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.  Further,
    states have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including
    subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds
    for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  Since the state
    did not have sufficient documentation in accordance with the state's specific
    requirements, we were unable to conclude if the payment was proper or improper.
  cyp8: Payments are unknown for the Child Care and Development Fund program because
    at the time of the HHS review, the available documentation was not sufficient
    to determine if the payment was proper or improper.  Under the Child Care and
    Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have maximum flexibility in developing
    the Child Care and Development Fund  programs and policies that best suit the
    needs of children and families within that state.   As such, key eligibility documentation
    requirements are controlled by states, and thus the specific documentation that
    the state failed to provide that make payments unknown vary across states.  For
    example, one of the key federal policy levers is income thresholds for determining
    eligibility, for which some states require paystubs to verify income.  In instances
    where the paystub is missing and there are no other mechanisms in place to verify
    income, it cannot be determined if the payment was proper or improper.

    cyp4_1: Overpayments are outside of HHS's control because the Child Care and Development
      Fund is a federally funded, state-administered block grant program, with funds
      awarded to states/recipients who then disburse funds to sub-recipients.  Under
      the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have flexibility
      within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including subsidy payment rates,
      co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining
      eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  Each state has maximum flexibility
      in developing the Child Care and Development Fund programs and policies that
      best suit the needs of children and families within that state.

  rap5: The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 and Child Care and
    Development Fund regulations (2016) required states to create and adopt new policies
    and procedures. State recipients have been implementing large-scale changes to
    their child care programs and HHS anticipated that the improper payment rate could
    be affected as states work to meet the new requirements.  HHS anticipated reestablishing
    the baseline and setting a reduction target in FY 2023, however, limitations and
    restrictions due to COVID-19 impacted states’ abilities to complete planned actions
    as states were granted needed flexibility.  The effects of COVID-19 will continue
    to impact the improper payment rate in the FY 2023 measurement and beyond, making
    it challenging to determine a target rate.  For these reasons, HHS is still working
    to establish a baseline, develop a tolerable rate, and therefore assess needs
    with respect to internal controls, human capital and information systems and other
    infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to a determined
    tolerable rate.
  rap6: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Child Care and Development
    Fund program, therefore, the program did not request resources in the most recent
    budget submission to establish and maintain internal controls to reduce improper
    payments and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate.
  rnp3: HHS's level of planned and completed corrective actions address the causes
    of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Child Care and Development
    Fund program and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and
    rate and root causes for several reasons.  Historically, training, and targeted
    technical assistance have been the primary methods used to address improper and
    unknown payments in the program. The improper payment rate has shown a steady
    decline since FY 2020, most recently decreasing from 3.96% in FY 2022 to 3.55%
    in FY 2023.  The maintenance of an error rate that is consistently below the statutory
    threshold indicates that this approach is appropriately addressing the root causes
    of the errors and are successful in reducing Improper Payments and Unknown Payments.  HHS
    will continue to receive specific root causes of errors and associated corrective
    actions from each reporting state under the policies unique to the state. Using
    this data, HHS will continue to provide targeted technical assistance to address
    the specific causes of errors for the state.  Further, the requirement for states
    with improper payment rates exceeding 10 percent to submit a formal Corrective
    Action Plan, and HHS’s process of working closely with states under a formal corrective
    action plan or needing assistance to address root causes of errors will continue
    to be a priority for the Agency.

    of an improper payment rate that is consistently below the statutory threshold
    indicates that this approach is adequate.
  act17_3: The effective implementation and prioritization of corrective actions for
    the Child Care and Development Fund program are evidenced in HHS's requirement
    that states with improper payment rates exceeding 10 percent are required to submit
    a formal Corrective Action Plan, which leads to additional monitoring and oversight
    of the implementation of the corrective actions. Further, HHS receives and reviews
    specific root causes of errors and associated corrective actions identified by
    each reporting state under the policies unique to the state. Based on these reviews,
    HHS provides targeted technical assistance for the reported specific causes of
    errors for the states. In addition, the unknown payment rate for the Child Care
    and Development Fund Program decreased from 2.41% in FY 2023 to 0% in FY 2024.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The reduction target is less than the estimated future Improper Payment
    and Unknown Payment rate for the Child Care and Development Fund program because
    the program has sufficient data to establish a baseline.  This baseline is based
    on actual data target data reported by states over a three year reporting period.  This
    three year reporting period is significant because approximately one-third of
    states report each year.  Having three years of data results in each state's data
    being considered in the calculation of a reduction target.

    cyp4_1: 'Overpayments are outside of HHS''s control because the Child Care and
      Development Fund is a federally funded, state-administered block grant program,
      with funds awarded to states/recipients who then disburse funds to sub-recipients.
      Under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have

      flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including subsidy
      payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds
      for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments. Each state
      has maximum flexibility in developing the Child Care and Development Fund programs
      and policies that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.'
  pro1: "The Child Care and Development Fund program is a federally funded, state-administered\
    \ block grant program with each state having maximum flexibility in developing\
    \ the Child Care and Development Fund programs and policies that best suit the\
    \ needs of children and families within that state. States tailor their review\
    \ of errors to reflect the policies and procedures unique to their state and therefore,\
    \ states have varying requirements for establishing and verifying a client’s eligibility.\
    \ \nFor this reason, there is not a common lexicon for root cause data/eligibility\
    \ themes across states and current Child Care and Development Fund program regulations\
    \ do not require states to collect and report the root cause of errors  in pre-determined\
    \ categories. The data used to calculate and report improper and unknown payments\
    \ data is collected by the states and aggregated at the federal level, and states\
    \ are not required to report dollar amounts associated with individual root causes.\
    \ Therefore, while the specific root causes of errors and associated corrective\
    \ actions are identified by each reporting state under the policies unique to\
    \ the state, the errors are consolidated into one control cause category for this\
    \ aggregate reporting at the federal level."
  rap5: HHS has resources to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the
    tolerable rate for the Child Care and Development Fund program.  However, an increase
    in funding that includes a request to increase the federal administrative set-aside
    to improve accountability and oversight for the Child Care and Development Fund
    from one half of one percent to one percent  was requested in the HHS FY 2025
    Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees to maintain and augment
    its ability to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable
    rate.  Dedicated federal administrative funds are used for federal staff, program
    supports, IT/data systems modernization and maintenance, program oversight, and
    accountability, and overhead costs.  Further, up to one-half of one percent of
    the Child Care and Development Fund program funding is reserved for the provision
    of training and technical assistance.  ACF provides this technical assistance
    through targeted support, intensive and long-term engagement with recipients,
    peer-to-peer learning opportunities between the states, information briefs and
    toolkits, and other strategies that are responsive to recipient requests for support.  The
    increase in training and technical assistance funding in FY 2023 resulted in continued
    investment in technical assistance to support recipients in improving their IT
    systems, including enrollment and eligibility tools for families and payments
    processes for providers, in order to improve the family and provider experience
    in the child care system. It also allowed for investments in other efforts to
    support recipients, including efforts related to payment practices, rate setting,
    and increasing access for families.
  rap6: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees includes
    a request to increase the federal administrative set-aside from one half of one
    percent to one percent to improve accountability and oversight for the Child Care
    and Development Fund.  Dedicated federal administrative funds are used for federal
    staff, program supports, IT/data systems modernization and maintenance, program
    oversight, and accountability, and overhead costs.  An increase to one percent
    will allow HHS to improve feedback timelines and increase support for recipients,
    including efforts related to payment practices, rate setting, and increasing access
    for families.
  rnp3: HHS's planned actions for the Child Care and Development Fund program are
    adequate because HHS received specific root causes of errors and associated corrective
    actions identified by each reporting state under the policies unique to the state.
    HHS provided and will continue to provide targeted technical assistance based
    on the reported specific causes of errors for the state. Historically, training,
    and targeted technical assistance have been the primary methods used to address
    improper and unknown payments in the program. The reduction in the unknown payment
    rate from 2.41% in FY 2023 to 0% in FY 2024 and the maintenance of an error rate
    that is consistently below the statutory threshold indicates that this approach
    is adequate.
  rnp4: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with the
    requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
    Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
    Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this annual
    assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control and Risk
    Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable office.
    Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement which represents
    the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to the overall adequacy
    and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating Division related
    to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal entities that
    receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes, and non-profit
    organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single Audit Act of
    1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative Requirements,
    Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that was in effect
    during FY 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities that expend $750,000
    or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal year. With the
    Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released revisions to the Uniform
    Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective October 01, 2024.  In
    addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities, overpayments
    are identified and recovered through Single Audits and HHS Office of Inspector
    General audits.  For each of the aforementioned activities, recipients are subject
    to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with program regulations.
