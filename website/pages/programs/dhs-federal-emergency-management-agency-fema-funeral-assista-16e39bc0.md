    Description_Action_Taken: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is strengthening
      the insurance verification process to assist in the review for a potential duplication
      of benefits. Through Funeral Assistance program reviews, there were noted instances
      applicant submitted limited insurance documents from life insurance companies,
      but it was not clear if the decedent actually had funeral and/or burial insurance
      coverage within the policy. As such, the program has made updates to the current
      operating procedures to strengthen the insurance verification process. FEMA
      will consider insurance specifically intended only for funeral and burial costs
      a duplication of benefits and will not consider more general insurance for which
      proceeds may be used towards funeral costs. This will continue to be program’s
      approach and it will be further clarified in the next version of the Individual
      Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG). In addition, FEMA is also enhancing
      the change management process as it relates to critical changes made throughout
      the assistance period to ensure that all relevant personnel and staff are aware
      of changes to the operating procedures and program requirements.

    Description_Action_Taken: Due to the expanded nature of COVID-19 Funeral assistance,
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implemented additional reports
      to monitor and mitigate the potential for Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown
      Payments (UPs). These daily reports identify data anomalies, to include (1)
      funeral assistance applications containing three or more decedents; (2) applications
      without decedent information; (3) applications transferred to another disaster;
      and (4) applications canceled as exact duplicates. Identification of these data
      elements were used to provide reminders and supplemental refresher trainings.
      Additionally, FEMA Recovery established a new section in the Reporting and Analytics
      Division in October 2022, solely dedicated to payment integrity, including case
      reviews, application of fraud prevention tools and controls, and coordination
      of guidance and procedure changes with the Individual Assistance (IA) program.

    Description_Action_Taken: "The National Emergency Management Information System\
      \ (NEMIS) is the information technology system that houses the survivor case\
      \ files and is the master database that the Federal Emergency Management Agency\
      \ (FEMA) uses to administer its assistance programs and make disaster assistance\
      \ decisions. NEMIS supports assistance programs across the Individuals and Households\
      \ Program (IHP) spectrum, which is divided into Housing Assistance and Other\
      \ Needs Assistance (ONA). Because Funeral Assistance is a part of ONA, FEMA\
      \ uses NEMIS to support funeral assistance processing. \n\nThe system is primarily\
      \ designed to support disaster relief to individuals and households whose property\
      \ has been damaged or destroyed rather than the loss of life associated with\
      \ funeral assistance. However, FEMA conducted a robust review of existing NEMIS\
      \ business rules including automated system controls for verifying information\
      \ such as addresses, and identity were conducted. This review was necessary\
      \ due to the anticipated intervention required to support a disaster declaration\
      \ limited to only COVID-19 Funeral Assistance instead of the full range of assistance\
      \ offered under a traditional IHP declaration. \n\nFEMA’s processing system,\
      \ NEMIS, performs automated checks on certain data elements within a funeral\
      \ assistance application to identify potential duplications. FEMA checks for\
      \ duplications in data fields such as applicant or co-applicant social security\
      \ number; damaged dwelling address (DDA); and deceased individual’s name, and\
      \ social security number. FEMA routes all these sources of potential duplication,\
      \ when identified, to the Duplicate Investigation queue for manual review. Applications\
      \ in the Duplicate Investigation queue require manual clearance of any potential\
      \ duplications before they may continue being processed. For most Individual\
      \ Assistance programs processed through NEMIS, the DDA field pertains to the\
      \ address where real or personal property damage occurred. In the case of COVID-19\
      \ Funeral Assistance, FEMA uses the DDA data field to document the location\
      \ where the COVID-19 death occurred. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many deaths\
      \ occurred at shared locations such as hospitals and medical facilities. As\
      \ such, the DDA data field is a common source of potential duplications identified\
      \ by the NEMIS system. All financial related errors are attributed to the required\
      \ human intervention for manually processingCOVID-19 funeral assistance, to\
      \ include manually reviewing NEMIS flags."

    Description_Action_Taken: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual
      Assistance (IA) Division provided refresher training in March 2023 to staff
      processing requests for COVID-19 Funeral Assistance. Going forward, FEMA will
      continue to coordinate with the Program Management Section (PMS) to send reminders
      to the staff processing funeral determinations to help reinforce guidance and
      enable personnel to mitigate errors. FEMA is also providing detailed instructions
      and examples of information processing that staff should verify on the internet
      and how to appropriately document within the application file record comments.
      In the early stages of COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, the internet search was
      not an option to resolving missing verification points. This was causing multiple
      calls to applicants asking them to provide the information, when funeral homes
      were not responding to verification calls, and leading to a high number of ineligible
      cases. Later guidance was updated to include an internet search in order to
      find information that would help with the verification process and reduce the
      burden on the applicant to provide. The internet search can assist caseworkers
      in finding a phone number of the funeral home, validating the funeral home is
      a valid business and confirming the death occurred by locating an obituary.

    \ of emergency or major disaster. \n\nIn the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress\
    \ authorized FEMA to provide Funeral Assistance through legislation. Congress\
    \ required FEMA to provide assistance for pandemic-related funeral expenses incurred\
    \ on or after January 20 through December 31, 2020, for deaths attributable to\
    \ COVID-19 under the Stafford Act COVID-19 pandemic declarations pursuant to Section\
    \ 201 of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act,\
    \ 2021 (P.L.116-260, Div. M). Congress also authorized a 100 percent federal cost\
    \ share. Additionally, Congress appropriated $2 billion to the Disaster Relief\
    \ Fund (DRF), to remain available until expended, to carry out such purposes.\
    \ Subsequently, Congress required FEMA to provide assistance for pandemic-related\
    \ funeral expenses incurred on or after January 20, 2020, at a 100 percent federal\
    \ cost share, pursuant to Section 4006 the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA;\
    \ P.L. 117-2). Congress also appropriated $50 billion to the DRF, to remain available\
    \ until September 30, 2025, for costs associated with major disaster declarations,\
    \ to include the provision of assistance under ARPA Section 4006. The Stafford\
    \ Act COVID-19 pandemic declarations for the declared States, territories, and\
    \ District of Columbia (but not the three tribes) were then amended to reflect\
    \ the authorization of IA, limited to COVID-19 Funeral Assistance. FEMA began\
    \ accepting applications on April 12, 2021 through a dedicated call center. \n\
    \nPer FEMA’s policy on COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, the agency will reimburse\
    \ up to $9,000 in eligible funeral expenses incurred on or after January 20, 2020,\
    \ at 100 percent federal cost share, for deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ and for applicants that have met the eligibility criteria to receive COVID-19\
    \ Funeral Assistance. As of October 2022, FEMA had provided over $2.8 billion\
    \ to eligible applicants with over 400,000 applications approved that, on average,\
    \ has provided applicants an average award of $6,400 to cover eligible funeral\
    \ expenses incurred related to the loss of a loved one due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\
    \ \n\nIn order to disburse the Funeral Assistance timely and equitably, FEMA has\
    \ had over 9.5 million web page views, translated graphics into over 29 different\
    \ languages, supported 76 languages through the helpline, and has placed over\
    \ 22,000 outbound calls to applicants. On February 9, 2023, the FEMA Administrator\
    \ announced that on May 11, 2023, the agency will close the incident periods for\
    \ all emergency and major disasters declared for the COVID-19 pandemic under the\
    \ Stafford Act. FEMA guidance reports that the end of the incident period will\
    \ not affect the application or eligibility for Funeral Assistance, and that “FEMA\
    \ intends to continue providing COVID-19 Funeral Assistance through September\
    \ 30, 2025, which is the date identified by Congress in the ARPA appropriation”."
  rap5: Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Funeral Assistance
    program is reporting an estimated error rate that identifies the program is susceptible
    to significant improper payments, FEMA is confident that the agency has what is
    needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information system
    and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments
    (UPs) to a tolerable rate. FEMA has specific reporting requirements established
    by the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA), as amended. The DRRA authorizes
    FEMA to waive a debt owed to the Government if covered assistance provided to
    an individual or household on or after October 28, 2012, was distributed in error
    by FEMA or if such assistance is subject to a claim or legal action. Section 1216(a)(3)
    of the DRRA requires the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to monitor
    FEMA’s distribution of covered assistance to individuals and households to determine
    the percentage distributed based on an error. Should the error rate exceed 4 percent
    of the total amount of covered assistance distributed, the DRRA requires FEMA
    to report actions it will take to reduce the error rate to congressional committees.
    FEMA will continue to strive to improve the IP rates for the Funeral Assistance
    program with the existing resourcing. However, as error rates continue to be reported
    below the 4 percent threshold established by the DRRA to prompt for congressional
    notification and attention, FEMA is confident that the agency does not specifically
    need additional human capital, information system and other infrastructure, etc.
    resourcing to sustain and further reduce the estimated error rate for the program.
  rap6: No additional resources have been requested specifically for the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) Funeral Assistance program in the DHS FY 2025 Budget.
    To continue to support disaster response, FEMA included a major disaster allocation
    to address ongoing Stafford Act disasters in the FY 2025 budget request which
    includes funding for continued recovery efforts in support of COVID-19, Hurricanes
    Maria, Fiona, and Ian, and other disaster activity.
  rnp3: "The majority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified\
    \ Improper Payments (IPs) stemmed from the required human intervention for manually\
    \ processing COVID-19 Funeral Assistance disbursements. As such, the majority\
    \ of the FEMA corrective actions taken have focused on policy and procedural enhancements,\
    \ training, and process improvements to reduce and prevent future IPs. The COVID-19\
    \ pandemic brought overwhelming grief to many families. FEMA has remained committed\
    \ to help people before, during, and after disasters and is dedicated to helping\
    \ ease some of the financial stress and burden caused by the virus. \n\nThe Consolidated\
    \ Appropriations Act, 2021, appropriated additional funding to the Disaster Relief\
    \ Fund to reimburse funeral expenses incurred through December 31, 2020. Subsequently,\
    \ the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA; enacted March 11,2021) also required\
    \ FEMA to provide Funeral Assistance for deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ and did not limit the date for expenses incurred. FEMA began accepting applications\
    \ on April 12, 2021 and, per FEMA’s policy, the agency will reimburse for eligible\
    \ funeral expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, for deaths attributed to the\
    \ COVID-19 pandemic. Although the COVID-19 incident period ended on May 11, 2023,\
    \ FEMA will continue to provide funeral assistance reimbursements until September\
    \ 30, 2025 to those that have lost loved ones due to the pandemic. \n\nAs highlighted\
    \ above, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program related to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ is expected to complete all disbursement activity by the end of fiscal year\
    \ (FY) 2025 and has seen substantial reductions in the program's disbursement\
    \ size and activity already. For example, in the less than six months of FY 2021\
    \ that FEMA disbursed Funeral Assistance, the program disbursed over $1,166 million.\
    \ For the full FY 2022 reporting period, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program disbursed\
    \ just over $1,697 million. Disbursement activity for the FEMA Funeral Assistance\
    \ program is down to just over $300 million in FY 2023. With the reduction in\
    \ the program size coupled with the expected end of the program in September 2025,\
    \ it is not cost beneficial for the agency to implement extensive corrective actions\
    \ for the sunsetting program in FY 2025."
  rnp4: "Department-wide, Component managers are responsible for completing internal\
    \ control work on payment processing as part of the Department’s Office of Management\
    \ and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 efforts. They are further responsible for\
    \ establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including a control\
    \ environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively managing\
    \ improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering any improper payments\
    \ that may occur. Management’s efforts, to include within DHS Headquarters as\
    \ well Components, around improper payments are subject to an annual compliance\
    \ review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). These measures are designed\
    \ to hold the appropriate personnel accountable for meeting applicable improper\
    \ payment reduction targets and establishing and maintaining strong internal controls\
    \ around payment management. \n\nDepartment-wide, the goals and requirements for\
    \ strong payment integrity are communicated to all levels of staff throughout\
    \ the DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office\
    \ and procurement staff. The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure\
    \ that managers, accountable officers, to include Component Chief Financial Officers\
    \ (CFOs), programs, States, and localities are held accountable for reducing and\
    \ recapturing improper payments. The Department’s CFO and senior staff have incorporated\
    \ improper payment expectations and performance in their annual performance plans.\
    \ \n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regularly engages with recipients\
    \ and process owners in monthly remediation meetings to ensure that appropriate\
    \ accountable officials are actively taking actions to reduce Improper Payments\
    \ (IPs) and identify and categorize Unknown Payment (UP) transactions as either\
    \ proper or improper. If a transaction is deemed proper, no further action is\
    \ taken. If a transaction is deemed technically improper, FEMA requires a corrective\
    \ action be put in place in order resolve issues surrounding procedures, policies,\
    \ and trainings. If a transaction is deemed improper and is associated with monetary\
    \ loss, then the transaction is submitted through the FEMA debt collection process\
    \ including Notice of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset, if applicable.\
    \ \n\nIn addition, FEMA tracks any changes to the program. Training, information\
    \ sharing, and the documentation of new processes will be prioritized. Payment\
    \ management reviews related to Internal Control over Financial Reporting are\
    \ conducted within the DHS control environment each fiscal year accompanied with\
    \ processes to review and examine for improper payments, to include but not limited\
    \ to duplicate payment reviews, card payment reviews, payroll analysis, etc."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: As 2024 is the first year that testing has been conducted for the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Funeral Assistance program, a second consecutive
    year of testing is expected to be completed with results published in 2025. Per
    the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance,
    based on that 24-month reporting period, a baseline will be established at that
    time if no significant changes are noted. From the established baseline, the agency
    will have a more accurate basis to establish a tolerable rate. However, based
    on the intent of the program and the program's relation to a nationwide emergency
    disaster, it is expected that the tolerable rate will be established at approximately
    2.5 percent.
