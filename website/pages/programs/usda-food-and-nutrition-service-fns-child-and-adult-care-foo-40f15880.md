    Description_Action_Taken: "Serious Deficiency Proposed Rule\nThe Food and Nutrition\
      \ Service (FNS) proposed a revision to the Serious Deficiency (SD) process for\
      \ Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program\
      \ (SFSP) in a Proposed Rule. After the Proposed Rule was published in February\
      \ 2024, FNS hosted webinars and presentations at conferences attended by stakeholders.\
      \ The Proposed Rule’s public comment period ended May 21, 2024. At that point\
      \ FNS assessed the comments on the proposed rule and began drafting a Final\
      \ Rule. In addition, FNS began work on a companion application designed to help\
      \ State agency users apply the SD process when evaluating the performance of\
      \ CACFP program sponsors and facilities. Together, these will streamline the\
      \ SD process and provide a user-friendly method for accurately implementing\
      \ the process. This will improve our method for identifying and ultimately addressing\
      \ SDs in CACFP.\nChild Nutrition (CN) Program Integrity Rule \nFNS expects the\
      \ rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at all\
      \ levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help\
      \ FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,\
      \ resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program\
      \ requirements. Of particular importance to the National School Lunch Program\
      \ (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), the rule allows States to adopt\
      \ a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously\
      \ states reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt\
      \ a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based\
      \ criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows\
      \ states to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS released\
      \ guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023. The rule also formalizes\
      \ a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process\
      \ improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied\
      \ through monitoring alone.\nCN Dashboards\nOn March 26, 2024, FNS made a set\
      \ of State Agency CN data dashboards available to State CN agencies. The tool\
      \ aims to promote state agency access to performance data for their own analysis.\
      \ To coincide with publishing the dashboards, FNS launched a CN dashboard user\
      \ group. Through the user group, FNS will provide support and analytic strategies\
      \ for users wishing to use the dashboard.\nProgress on CACFP Integrity Studies\n\
      FNS continues to explore feasible methods for assessing meal claiming error\
      \ at family day care homes."

    cyp4_1: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs are State-managed federal
      programs. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors, and
      ultimately to program recipients. Improper payments identified during the course
      of a review, audit, or other operational oversight activities can be recovered
      either through direct billing or through an offset of future program payments
      earned. FNS has been advised by our Office of General Counsel that since program
      statutes are very specific in describing circumstances under which recoveries
      of improper payments are to be made, recoveries made on the basis of a statistical
      sample or estimation procedure would not be appropriate, and that FNS would
      need new statutory authority to pursue such collections.
  pro1: In prior years, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) improper payment
    rate only included estimates based on the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering
    study. With the completion of the analysis for Erroneous Payments in Child Care
    Centers Study (EPICCS), FNS is able to obtain an improper payment rate for Centers
    and have split CACFP reporting into FDCHs and Centers. The reported improper payment
    rate for centers is derived primarily from the results of the EPICCS study, with
    the exception of the At-Risk component, which uses the rate from the FDCH tiering
    study. Unlike the other center-based components, at-risk uses area eligibility
    for determining certification, which is more similar to tiering error than the
    application-based rate established in EPICCS.
  rap5: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food Program
    (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to calculate
    annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census approach. Instead,
    FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies. FNS has developed
    a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision
    component of the program, and a separate methodology for the remaining components
    of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via the Erroneous Payments
    in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements vary significantly
    by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate of improper payments
    is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative methodologies for developing
    a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision meal claims component. FNS
    is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order to protect taxpayer dollars
    and safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on at childcare. Therefore,
    FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable rate for CACFP that
    fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while executing the program's
    processes to maximum possible effect as allowed under statute.
  rap6: "An increase of $19,489,000 and 42 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) in Training\
    \ and Technical Assistance ($45,996,000 and 59 FTE available in 2024). \nEffective\
    \ and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States\
    \ properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States\
    \ are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This includes a total\
    \ of $17.1 million for current law proposals, $3.8 million of which is for a 2025\
    \ proposal and $13.3 million is for 2024 re-proposals. The requested increase\
    \ includes $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal:\
    \ Increase Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation,\
    \ $1.3 million and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal\
    \ Administration of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation\
    \ and oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current\
    \ Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the Child\
    \ Nutrition (CN) Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget\
    \ lines. The next current law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff to support\
    \ the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical Assistance,\
    \ which enhances the Food and Nutrition Service’s ability to provide critical\
    \ training, technical assistance, and oversight to ensure program integrity and\
    \ compliance with Federal law and regulations for CN in both national and regional\
    \ offices. The fourth current law proposal for $2 million is to support the 2024\
    \ Current Law Re-proposal: Enterprise Risk Management: helps with approaches in\
    \ FNS strategic planning and program operations. The remaining increase is due\
    \ to inflation and 2025 pay cost. \n\nAn increase of $2,743,000 in CN Studies\
    \ ($21,005,000 and 13 FTE available in 2024). \nFNS conducts a variety of studies,\
    \ evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers\
    \ and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their\
    \ goals effectively, which include improving public health, nutrition, and equity.\
    \ This program line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CN Programs,\
    \ including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The request includes\
    \ $2 million for the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Research on the U.S. Territories.\
    \ The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.\n\nAn increase\
    \ of $9,248,000 and 28 FTE in CN Payment Accuracy ($12,315,000 and 72 FTE available\
    \ in 2024).\nThis funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight, monitoring,\
    \ and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention,\
    \ and resolution of erroneous payments. This includes a total of $8.2 million\
    \ for current law proposals: $4 million and 20 staff to support the 2025 Current\
    \ Law Proposal: Investment in Regional Financial Management for Program Integrity,\
    \ which helps regional Grants Management and Administrative Services (GMAS) Staff\
    \ across CN Program accounts. The next current law proposal is for $3 million\
    \ to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Strengthen CACFP Program Integrity,\
    \ which will spread through a variety of activities including data mining and\
    \ a technical assistance support center designed to support States in identifying\
    \ and addressing program integrity risks. The third current law is for $1.2 million\
    \ and 8 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT. The balance of the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT is split between the CN Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical\
    \ Assistance budget lines. The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025\
    \ pay cost."

  rnp4: In order to ensure manager, program, and State-level accountability through
    annual performance appraisal criteria for payment integrity and meeting Improper
    and Unknown Payment reduction targets, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Child
    and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) has implemented binding agreements to operate
    program according to all program rules. FNS has a robust review process that includes
    state-level review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of States
    to ensure program integrity within the program. Applicable for Fiscal Year (FY)
    2023, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has issued a policy memo to State program
    operators of the CACFP entitled, "Area Eligibility for Summer 2022 and School
    Year 2022-2023." The memo provides guidance on determining CACFP eligibility for
    at-risk afterschool centers, which relies on school data, when complete school
    data is unavailable due to waivers used during the pandemic. FNS Regional Offices
    are completing three (3) Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each of which
    also includes a local level review where FNS staff accompany State agencies (SAs)
    on reviews of operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of State agency operations
    and administration and can result in a report of findings, which require the SA
    to correct any problems. This helps to ensure that SAs are properly monitoring
    certification and meal counting at the local level and are working with local
    operators to reduce improper payments. In addition, FNS continues to provide technical
    assistance related to the $50M released in FY 2024 for non-competitive Technology
    Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds for Child Nutrition (CN) State agencies to improve
    information technology (IT) systems. Throughout FY 2023, FNS worked with grant
    recipients who are using funds to develop, improve, maintain CN IT systems. FNS
    expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by nTIG
    recipients administering CACFP will improve the SAs ability to train, monitor,
    provide technical assistance, and take corrective actions.

Description: USDA's Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) provides federal reimbursement
  through the states to child care centers and family day care homes (FDCH). Sponsoring
  organizations are responsible for immediate oversight of providers. The states are
  responsible for overseeing CACFP sponsors. Centers certify children for program
  benefits through household applications. FDCHs primarily rely on community measures
  of poverty to identify eligibility at the facility level. For both programs, sponsor
  error in eligibility determination ("certification error") is a leading cause of
  IPs. A significant barrier is the decentralized nature of the program; USDA does
  not directly confirm individual children or day care home facilities for eligibility.
