    Description_Action_Taken: 'In May 2024, the Army, in a joint effort with the Defense
      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), briefed the Army travel pay program’s
      performance during the Annual Army and DFAS Customer Workshop. Furthermore,
      the Defense Travel Management Office’s (DTMO) Travel Assistance Center (TAC)
      conducted DTS training sessions to the Department on the 2nd & 4th Tuesday of
      every month, two sessions each day.


      Furthermore, the DFAS sends a DTS error notification email each month to the
      Army Command’s Lead Defense Travel Administrator (LDTA), the traveler, and the
      approving official/certifying officers with instructions to correct the error.
      Travelers, with assistance from the organization’s LDTA, if necessary, have
      14 business days to correct the error. The Army Command’s LDTA ensures completion
      of all the monthly DTS error list within their command. The Army discusses the
      status and completion of the monthly DTS error list every other month with the
      Army Command’s LDTAs, G-8s, and GS-15 (or military equivalent grade). These
      more frequent training sessions are new for Review Year 2024.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Army Defense Travel System (DTS) statutory improper
      payments were attributed to Army travelers who failed to provide receipts or
      provided invalid receipts for authorized expenses (e.g., airfare, rental vehicle
      and lodging) while on temporary duty. However, the DTS approving officials/certifying
      officers approved these DTS vouchers as pay-ready for reimbursement when the
      vouchers lacked proper documentation in accordance with the Department of Defense
      Financial Management Regulation, Volume 9, "Travel Policy."


      In Review Year 2025, the Army will continue to conduct collaborative training
      sessions every other month with the Army Command''s Lead Defense Travel Administrator
      and senior travel management leaders to emphasize the objectives and requirements
      of the Payment Integrity Information Act program, strengthen internal controls
      and to mitigate submitting, reviewing and approving non-compliant DTS vouchers.'

  act17_1: The Army communicated with the Army commands based on the requirement to
    attend the collaborative sessions and trainings. The Army provided the commands
    with key resources, policies, guidance, and support to meet the Department’s improper
    payment reduction goals. The Army also mandated the Army Command’s G-8 senior
    leaders to attend the sessions and render the necessary actions to ensure compliance
    with PIIA requirements and support for the pillars of the Travel Pay program.
    An emphasis on accountability at the command level programs ensure effective implementation
    and convey the prioritization of corrective actions.
  act17_2: The Army has demonstrated overarching effective corrective actions by ensuring
    the training is both robust, adequate and widely disseminated to ensure the increase
    of preventing improper payments. The Army's continued plan of training their workforce
    coupled with continuous monitoring and reporting within the Army and Department
    will prove to be beneficial.
  act17_3: Lack of understanding official travel requirements is the primary root
    cause of improper payments. The Army will continue utilizing error trend analysis
    from post-pay reviews as an effective method to determine areas of focus for training.
    By targeting additional training for repeat offenders and/or removing approval
    responsibilities throughout the Army's Command infrastructure, the Army will instill
    accountability at every Command level of the program. Due to the Army utilizing
    year in arrears in the Travel Pay program, the effectiveness of actions taken
    will be determined when FY2024 actual travel payment results are measured. For
    invalid receipts, the policy change to permit use of other corroborating documentation
    only resolves issues with receipts that do not meet the Department's definition.
    For instances where the traveler provides documentation that is other than a receipt
    (e.g., hotel reservation, flight itinerary, or rental car pickup slip), awareness
    training and command accountability will continue to be focus areas. Resources,
    guidance, support, training, and communication are continuous. Payment Integrity
    personnel provide commands detailed information, data, and recommendations to
    reduce improper payments and unknown payments. The Army's Defense Travel System
    (DTS) Travel Pay program's performance metrics and solutions are discussed, explained,
    and tracked for resolutions. Effective management and oversight will ensure reviewing
    officials and approving officials comply with regulatory guidance and conduct
    duties to the standard that would ensure timely and accurate (with valid supporting
    documentations) DTS voucher disbursements. The Army will continue to conduct collaborative
    sessions every other month with the Army Command's Lead Defense Travel Administrators
    and senior travel management leaders to (1) emphasize the objectives and requirements
    of the Payment Integrity program; (2)  strengthen internal controls; (3) and mitigate
    the submission, review, and approval of non-compliant DTS vouchers.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Department is confident in the Army's ability and determination in
    reducing improper and unknown payments within the Army's Defense Travel System
    Payment Integrity Program. The Army has developed a robust corrective action plan
    centering on training their workforce and fully utilizing their Command and Control
    infrastructure to maximize the operational impacts and effectiveness. Additionally,
    the Army created an effective reporting methodology to ensure that senior Army
    leadership is aware of the progress being made which will ensure the tone at the
    top and Army priorities are achieved.

  cyp6_1: 'The primary cause for technically improper payments was travelers, reviewing
    officials, and approving officials/certifying officers not attaching or ensuring
    valid receipts were uploaded in the Defense Travel System (DTS) to support travel
    expenses claimed (e.g., airfare, rental car, and lodging). The receipts were invalid
    because they did not contain the elements for a valid receipt in accordance with
    the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 9, "Travel Policy"
    and the Defense Travel Management Office’s DTS Guide 3: Vouchers.


    Another cause was the Army Command’s travel personnel overlooked the travel policy
    stated in Army Regulation 600-8-105, "Military Orders," to ensure that verbal
    order information from the Commanding Officer (VOCO) resided in DTS. This occurred
    when travelers performed urgent TDY missions without first completing their DTS
    authorizations (TDY orders), and then initiating TDY settlement claims upon returning
    to the permanent duty or home station after performing the TDY.'

  cyp7_ucp4_1: 'The Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume
    9, Definitions, Receipts, requires six elements for a valid receipt. Any element
    missing on a receipt renders it invalid. For example, an airfare receipt charged
    a traveler an unknown government expense, but it was itemized; a taxi receipt
    reflected an extra charge without an explanation; a lodging receipt showed a miscellaneous
    expense, but it was not defined. The vendors/providers are responsible for written
    explanation for the charges stated on their receipts for the services performed
    for the traveler.  Army Command’s travelers, reviewing officials, and approving
    officials/certifying officers must also be more attentive on ensuring receipts
    provided meet the definition a valid receipt. Otherwise, the temporary duty (TDY)
    vouchers would result in unknown payments.


    In order to reimburse travelers who performed TDY, the right travel entitlements,
    the authority to pay must first be resident in the DTS. Travelers who performed
    TDY and claimed reimbursement for commercial lodging or meals (when the original
    order stated that the use of lodging and meals are directed), a SNA, CNA or DD
    Form 1351-5 is required and signed by an authorized official. This validates that
    the use of government assets were not available at the TDY location. Travelers
    must upload the pertinent document into DTS for review and approval. Otherwise,
    the claim will be rendered as an unknown payment until the traveler uploads the
    valid supporting document into DTS to resolve the error.'
  cyp8: "The root cause for unknown payments were the travelers’ Defense Travel System\
    \ (DTS) claims did not contain the corroborating key supporting documentation\
    \ (KSD). Without the travel claim KSDs, the validity of the payment can not be\
    \ determined. Examples of unattached travel KSDs include the deployment orders,\
    \ orders to perform TDY missions at other location(s), statement or certificate\
    \ for non-availability (SNA/CNA) or DD Form 1351-5, for lodging/meals; lodging\
    \ receipt with another traveler’s name; lodging receipts were not provided; and\
    \ a furnished memorandum instead of the actual deployment order. At the time of\
    \ the voucher review, the accuracy of these TDY claims could not be verified as\
