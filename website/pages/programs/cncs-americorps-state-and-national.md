      AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group has identified
      the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based on this
      information, the group has created resources and delivered training focused
      on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. Those trainings were
      available to grantees for FY 2023. The agency also provided resolution packets
      to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment, linking specific root
      cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment.

    \ FGP are made that the grantee level. The improper payments in ASN and FGP are\
    \ not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary loss to the\
    \ government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s grantees\
    \ are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine if the payment\
    \ was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct control over the\
    \ payments, it has implemented updated trainings to ensure the grantees have the\
    \ requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.\n"
  rnp4: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action plan
    group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group will be
    reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from offices across
    the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action plan development,
    the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary to reduce improper
    payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are made at the grantee
    level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control training to strengthen
    the control environment at the grantee level. Executive managers, programs, and
    other staff contribute to improper payment corrective action planning. Reduction
    in improper payments may be included in performance conversations for those accountable
    for the reduction.
