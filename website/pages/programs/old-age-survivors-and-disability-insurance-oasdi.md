  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we released several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve the system.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The
      CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process,
      increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted
      product is comprised of four separate workstreams, across several component
      business and systems sponsors.  In addition to work CDRs, the Product aims to
      modernize the medical CDR process with the addition of online service options
      and reduce paper case processing by automating current Electronic Disability
      Collect System exclusions.  In February 2023, CDR product released the i454
      which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or
      a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician''s
      process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2024, we plan to release Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the Electronic
      Disability Collect System (EDCS) that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.
      and plan to make the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We
      are currently beginning the development of a  modernized version of eWork which
      will eventually be integrated into the existing EDCS application and will make
      EDCS available for field office technicians.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021,
      we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs
      that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation
      (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with
      processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, six
      BOTs have been created and placed into production.  Use of the BOTs reduces
      keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In
      FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and
      implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input
      of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term
      investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes
      and eliminate manual actions.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to the all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'We will continue our quality reviews and cost-effective
      program integrity work including medical disability reviews.


      For improper payments within the agency’s control, we will continue to invest
      in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly
      systems and tools to better serve the public.  To meet the challenges of our
      growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we will streamline
      our procedures and automate more of our business processes.


      For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we are addressing the challenge
      of reliance on self-reporting by promoting timely wage reporting and issuing
      reminders on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to utilize an automated information
      exchange with commercial payroll data providers to reduce the reliance on self-reporting
      of wages.  We plan to continue current computer-matching agreements (CMAs) that
      yield a positive cost-benefit ratio, expand effective CMAs to meet additional
      program needs, research current programs, work with internal stakeholders to
      identify data exchange needs, and pursue new data exchanges with potential partners.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we inform Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance beneficiaries about their reporting responsibilities.  Section 826
      of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required the Commissioner to establish
      and implement a system permitting DI beneficiaries to report their earnings
      electronically.  Our myWageReport (myWR) online application, allows DI beneficiaries,
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent beneficiaries, and
      representative payees to report wages and view, print, or save a receipt.  DI
      self-reporters and their representative payees can report wages that occurred
      within a two-year timeframe from the reporting date.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos depicting three reporting options:  my Social Security, SSA
      Mobile Wage Reporting, and SSI Telephone Wage Reporting.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplifying our notices.  Although we made efforts
      to simplify notices, some of our notices and communications can be complex,
      lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from
      the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain
      information.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the
      quality and understandability of our communications.  We will inform and remind
      beneficiaries about reporting responsibilities.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we look for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
      (OASDI) beneficiaries who are working and it may affect their eligibility to
      receive OASDI benefits.  WorkSmart is a tool that identifies Disability Insurance
      beneficiaries whose earnings put them at risk for being overpaid.  We created
      the WorkSmart project to reduce and prevent Improper Payments and complete work
      Continuing Disability Reviews more efficiently by identifying earnings earlier,
      identifying cases that have earnings above substantial gainful activity (SGA)
      and are still receiving benefits, and prioritizing cases that are most likely
      to end in an SGA cessation.  This helps prevent beneficiaries from building
      overpayment debts.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by data or information
      needed does not exist and inability to access the data or information needed,
      we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors
      in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach
      efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States Data Exchange
      Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of
      best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a
      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical
      State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and
      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment Compensation
      Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’ compensation
      program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), provides coverage
      to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of FECA benefits can offset
      Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits.  SSA and DOL have agreed
      to move forward with our request for DOL FECA data.  We are working to finalize
      the agreement for DOL to provide FECA payment data to assist us in our offset
      requirements.  We expect the exchange to be completed in fiscal year 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the
      reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools,
      such as an information exchange with commercial payroll data providers authorized
      by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the
      Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We have completed several phases of pre-implementation
      development and are drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations
      for the PIE process.  We will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after
      the final rule (regulation) is established.  We will perform ongoing assessments
      while working towards full implementation.'

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To focus our efforts, we have a team dedicated to monitoring
      and measuring the effectiveness on the progress of improper payment mitigation
      strategies and corrective actions.  We have the Improper Payments Alignment
      Strategy where we conduct root cause analysis of the improper payment, obtain
      agency-wide engagement, and agreement of actions needed to remedy improper payment
      issues.  This approach helps us develop corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      that are focused on the root cause of improper payments.


      Program integrity workloads ensure that we issue program dollars appropriately.  We
      conducted both medical and work continuing disability reviews to determine if
      a beneficiary remains eligible for benefits.


      For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure
      to access data or information needed, our corrective actions and strategies
      fall within several high-level categories such as automation, business process
      improvement (including program and policy simplification), and training to improve
      accuracy.  We also evaluated the completed corrective actions to determine whether
      changes in the outcome can be attributed to the implementation of the corrective
      actions.  We compared data before and after the implementation of corrective
      actions to determine whether we need additional actions.


      We are investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees
      with user-friendly systems and tools to better serve the public, including a
      single unified process for benefit applications and a consolidated source with
      all information and agency interactions with our customers.  To meet the challenges
      of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining
      our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating
      more of our business processes.  We will continue to issue periodic reminders
      and policy clarifications, as needed.


      We plan to utilize an automated information exchange with a commercial payroll
      data provider to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages as our corrective
      action for the root cause of overpayments outside the agency’s control due to
      our inability to access data or information needed.  Additionally, we are promoting
      timely wage reporting and issuing reminders on reporting responsibilities.  In
      December 2022, we published on YouTube a video on how to report wages to promote
      the reporting options such as myWageReport.  In February 2023, we published
      to Facebook an educational video on the various options available to report
      wages.


      We understand that reminders will not solve all problems related to improper
      payments caused by root cause factors outside the agency’s control.  However,
      we will influence change where possible by simplifying communications and the
      way information is presented as our approach to reduce cognitive burden and
      improve understanding and readability.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
      and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a
      comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of
      WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross agency work group to review
      all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive
      list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the
      root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy,
      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  Since FY 2017, there has been
      a significant reduction in improper payments related to WEP and GPO.  In July
      2023, the WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  However,
      we continue to assert that the complexity of our program makes it extremely
      challenging to isolate the effects of a particular corrective action.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access data or information needed, we look for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for higher Supplemental
      Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  From March to August
      2020, SSI applications decreased by 30 percent when compared to prior years.  We
      analyzed a range of beneficiary characteristics to determine if any groups were
      disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We identified a population
      of 1.4 million individuals who are currently receiving OASDI benefits that are
      less than the SSI federal benefit rate.  Based on these findings, we mailed
      approximately 200,000 letters to beneficiaries potentially eligible for SSI,
      with a focus on the aged and limited English proficiency population.  The preliminary
      mailing occurred December 2020–March 2021.  We released the remaining 1.2 million
      mailers on a staggered schedule from June 2021–November 2021, pausing to avoid
      increased call months, and resumed the issuance of mailers from April 2022–December
      2022.  Beneficiaries who had an email registered with the agency also received
      an email.  In October 2022, we mailed out more than 19,000 notices to beneficiaries
      receiving spousal benefits who may have sufficient earnings to be eligible for
      higher retirement benefits based on their own earnings.  In December 2022, we
      issued a reminder to field office and payment center technicians on proper development
      of the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset.  In April
      2023, we mailed out almost 38,000 notices to surviving spouses who are potentially
      eligible for higher retirement benefits on their own records.  We issued a reminder
      on instructions regarding the potential entitlement workload concerning disabled
      beneficiaries who are potentially eligible for widow(er)’s insurance benefits
      or disabled widow’s benefits.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we issue reminders and policy clarifications to
      employees, as needed.  In November 2023, we issued a reminder to technicians
      about the importance of inputting Family Max when manually calculating benefits.  In
      March 2024, we updated policy providing detailed information to technicians
      regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely,
      when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  We will
      continue to issue reminders and policy clarifications to employees, as needed.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by inability to\
      \ access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners\
      \ from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business\
      \ sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community\
      \ of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to\
      \ engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming\
      \ data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist\
      \ in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.\
      \  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper\
      \ payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage\
      \ State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September\
      \ 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the\
      \ purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts\
      \ with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage\
      \ more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure\
      \ to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.\
      \  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.\
      \  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians\
      \ for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data. \
      \ Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined\
      \ death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR). \
      \ As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process. \
      \ We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving\
      \ the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records\
      \ in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued\
      \ a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports\
      \ of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death\
      \ information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association\
      \ for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of\
      \ historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity,\
      \ and completeness of our death data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused\
      \ by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment\
      \ Compensation Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’\
      \ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL),\
      \ provides coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of\
      \ FECA benefits can offset Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)\
      \ benefits.  We have agreed with DOL to move forward with our request for DOL\
      \ FECA data.  We are working to finalize the agreement for DOL to provide FECA\
      \ payment data to assist us in our offset requirements.  In December 2023, the\
      \ agency established an eCOMP system Memorandum of Understanding with DOL to\
      \ obtain FECA benefits to allow the agency to offset OASDI benefits and prevent\
      \ or reduce overpayments.  Technicians can complete an ad hoc query in eCOMP\
      \ to obtain FECA data, the FECA payment status, dates, amounts and it is immediately\
      \ available to the technician via the eCOMP portal.  In April 2024, we provided\
      \ reminders on how to process initial claims with workers compensation lump-sum\
      \ settlement allegations.  We expect the exchange to be completed in FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or\
      \ information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and\
      \ to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage\
      \ reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial\
      \ payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget\
      \ Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In\
      \ February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing\
      \ the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers\
      \ to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves\
      \ service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.\
      \  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which\
      \ is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we\
      \ completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue\
      \ diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from\
      \ PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review\
      \ and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased\
      \ approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements\
      \ and allow us to respond to public concerns from the NPRM public comment period."
    Mitigation_Strategy: app5_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience\
      \ (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process\
      \ all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake\
      \ processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,\
      \ reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed\
      \ entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the\
      \ application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available\
      \ in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability\
      \ Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY)\
      \ 2023, there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software\
      \ performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.\
      \  In December 2023, CCE Announcements became available.  Now, when updates\
      \ are made within CCE, the technicians receive a brief message the first time\
      \ they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided\
      \ for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement\
      \ is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information\
      \ within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related to\
      \ CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including\
      \ the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the\
      \ User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing\
      \ and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page\
      \ with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements,\
      \ we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation,\
      \ which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism\
      \ to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error\
      \ and reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating\
      \ the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional\
      \ application.  We also plan to release our first retirement benefit application\
      \ within CCE.  We will test it in a few field offices before a national release.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.\
      \  The CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review\
      \ process, increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.\
      \  The multifaceted product is comprised of four separate workstreams:  Work\
      \ CDR, Medical CDR, Electronic Disability Collect System (EDCS), and CDRs Modernization,\
      \ across several component business and systems sponsors.  In FY 2023, CDR product\
      \ released the i454 which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to\
      \ file the SSA-454 or a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online\
      \ version, the technician's process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.\
      \  In FY 2024, we released Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the EDCS\
      \ that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.  We made the eWork system\
      \ Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We are currently developing a modernized\
      \ replacement of eWork which will be integrated into the existing EDCS application.\
      \  The eWork replacement will reinforce policy and intuitively drive best practices\
      \ to reduce improper payments.  In FY 2024 we made technical releases for the\
      \ eWork replacement.  We will release the minimum viable product to technicians\
      \ in tandem with retiring eWork by the end of FY 2025.  Subsequent releases\
      \ will be scheduled for FY 2026 if funding permits.  \n\nTo address improper\
      \ payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed\
      \ the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer\
      \ relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information\
      \ about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our\
      \ employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving\
      \ the overall customer experience.  In FY 2023, TED added Registration and Customer\
      \ Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.\
      \  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  In February\
      \ 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all field offices and workload support\
      \ units.  In March 2024, an additional task called External Tasks became available.\
      \  External Tasks provides technicians the ability to open commonly used applications\
      \ directly from TED.  As of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications\
      \ available via TED.  We plan to continue to enhance the customer composite\
      \ by bringing in and displaying more customer information from other systems.\
      \  Releases to enhance existing functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We\
      \ are also working on plans to expand to other user groups, such as the field\
      \ and regional offices including Appellate Operations.  Integration of the technician\
      \ facing portion of Visitor Intake Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In FY 2021, we pursued\
      \ a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs that\
      \ will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation (RPA),\
      \ or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with processing\
      \ manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, several BOTs\
      \ have been created and placed into production.  In FY 2024, we added a BOT\
      \ utilized by headquarters analysts, that helped reduce stale Registration,\
      \ Appointment and Services for Representatives (RASR) appointments.  Technicians\
      \ are able to use the BOT to review and terminate stale appointments in the\
      \ RASR database.  Use of BOTs reduces keystrokes and manual coding and detects\
      \ exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In FY 2025, we plan to enhance the\
      \ existing RPA scripts and identify opportunities to automate computations and\
      \ inputs to reduce input errors.  We are making a long-term investment in robotics\
      \ technology using the software to improve business processes and eliminate\
      \ manual actions.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents\
      \ electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into\
      \ production.  In September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature,\
      \ which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience\
      \ and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded\
      \ the eSignature/Upload Documents service to all field offices and workload\
      \ support units nationwide.  This release allows customers to access the service\
      \ with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also, in March 2024, eSignature/Upload\
      \ Documents became available to all Field Offices and Workload Support Units\
      \ Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months, we began releasing mobile\
      \ friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms for customer completion.\
      \  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated 10-day follow up reminder\
      \ and confirmation of successful submission emails to enhance communication\
      \ with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated the service with my\
      \ Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text communications.\
      \  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms for a mobile\
      \ friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and evidence\
      \ types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social Security\
      \ and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including Upload\
      \ Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand to 3rd party\
      \ forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional support\
      \ to our mutual customers."

      \ evaluate a beneficiary’s state of being unmarried, married, divorced, or widowed.\
      \  Entitlement to some categories of benefits is impacted by the beneficiary’s\
      \ marital status, so we rely on beneficiaries to report changes in their marital\
      \ status.  Section 826 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required the Commissioner\
      \ to establish and implement a system permitting Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries\
      \ to report their earnings electronically.  Our myWageReport (myWR) online application,\
      \ allows DI beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent\
      \ beneficiaries, and representative payees to report wages and view, print,\
      \ or save a receipt.  DI self-reporters and their representative payees can\
      \ report wages that occurred within a two-year timeframe from the reporting\
      \ date.  We promote use of our online wage reporting application, myWR, on social\
      \ media with training videos.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we released\
      \ social media posts on Facebook and X sharing a link to our YouTube video to\
      \ help beneficiaries learn why it is important to report wages and the automated\
      \ electronic options for wage reporting.  In February 2024, we issued reminders\
      \ on Social Security TV in field office reception areas to report relationship\
      \ changes as it may affect their Social Security payments.  In August 2024,\
      \ we published a blog about the importance of reporting changes.  The article\
      \ provided examples of life changes that need to be reported to Social Security\
      \ to avoid overpayments.  In July and August 2024, we used our social media\
      \ channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly\
      \ reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure\
      \ accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media\
      \ channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly\
      \ reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure\
      \ accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  These posts also inform beneficiaries\
      \ how we are required by law to adjust benefits or recover debts when people\
      \ receive payments they are not entitled to.  \n\nTo address improper payments\
      \ caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we are working\
      \ to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of our notices and communications\
      \ can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can\
      \ sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal requirements\

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
      and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a
      comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of
      WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross-agency work group to review
      all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive
      list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the
      root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy,
      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the
      WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  In FY 2023,
      there was an increase in improper payments related to WEP, but overall, since
      FY 2017, there has been a significant reduction in improper payments related
      to WEP and GPO.  In March 2024, we provided detailed information to technicians
      regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely,
      when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  In FY 2024,
      we developed a new policy to address multiple non-covered pensions distributed
      or terminated at different periods of time.  This will provide a consistent
      national policy.  We plan to publish the policy in FY 2025.

      \ access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners\
      \ from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business\
      \ sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community\
      \ of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to\
      \ engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming\
      \ data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist\
      \ in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.\
      \  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper\
      \ payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage\
      \ State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September\
      \ 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the\
      \ purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts\
      \ with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage\
      \ more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure\
      \ to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.\
      \  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.\
      \  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians\
      \ for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data. \
      \ Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined\
      \ death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR). \
      \ As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process. \
      \ We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving\
      \ the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records\
      \ in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued\
      \ a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports\
      \ of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death\
      \ information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association\
      \ for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of\
      \ historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity,\
      \ and completeness of our death data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused\
      \ by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment\
      \ Compensation Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’\
      \ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL),\
      \ provides coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of\
      \ FECA benefits can offset Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)\
      \ benefits.  We have agreed with DOL to move forward with our request for DOL\
      \ FECA data.  We are working to finalize the agreement for DOL to provide FECA\
      \ payment data to assist us in our offset requirements.  In December 2023, the\
      \ agency established an eCOMP system Memorandum of Understanding with DOL to\
      \ obtain FECA benefits to allow the agency to offset OASDI benefits and prevent\
      \ or reduce overpayments.  Technicians can complete an ad hoc query in eCOMP\
      \ to obtain FECA data, the FECA payment status, dates, amounts and it is immediately\
      \ available to the technician via the eCOMP portal.  In April 2024, we provided\
      \ reminders on how to process initial claims with workers compensation lump-sum\
      \ settlement allegations.  We expect the exchange to be completed in FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or\
      \ information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and\
      \ to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage\
      \ reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial\
      \ payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget\
      \ Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In\
      \ February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing\
      \ the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers\
      \ to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves\
      \ service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.\
      \  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which\
      \ is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we\
      \ completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue\
      \ diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from\
      \ PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review\
      \ and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased\
      \ approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements\
      \ and allow us to respond to public concerns from the NPRM public comment period."

  2024:
    act17_1: 'To focus our efforts, we have a team dedicated to monitoring and measuring
      the effectiveness on the progress of improper payment mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions.  We have the Improper Payments Alignment Strategy where
      we conduct root cause analysis of the improper payment, obtain agency-wide engagement,
      and agreement of actions needed to remedy improper payment issues.  This approach
      helps us develop corrective actions and mitigation strategies that are focused
      on the root cause of improper payments.


      Program integrity workloads ensure that we issue program dollars appropriately.  We
      conducted both medical and work continuing disability reviews to determine if
      a beneficiary remains eligible for benefits.


      For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure
      to access data or information needed, our corrective actions and strategies
      fall within several high-level categories such as automation, business process
      improvement (including program and policy simplification), and training to improve
      accuracy.  We also evaluated the completed corrective actions to determine whether
      changes in the outcome can be attributed to the implementation of the corrective
      actions.  We compared data before and after the implementation of corrective
      actions to determine whether we need additional actions.


      We are investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees
      with user-friendly systems and tools to better serve the public, including a
      single unified process for benefit applications and a consolidated source with
      all information and agency interactions with our customers.  To meet the challenges
      of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining
      our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating
      more of our business processes.  We will continue to issue periodic reminders
      and policy clarifications, as needed.


      We plan to utilize an automated information exchange with a commercial payroll
      data provider to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages as our corrective
      action for the root cause of overpayments outside the agency’s control due to
      our inability to access data or information needed.  This exchange is referred
      to as the Payroll Information Exchange.  Additionally, we are promoting timely
      wage reporting and issuing reminders on reporting responsibilities.  From October
      2023 through February 2024, we released social media posts on Facebook and Twitter
      sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn about the importance
      of reporting wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.


      We understand that reminders will not solve all problems related to improper
      payments caused by root cause factors outside the agency’s control.  However,
      we will influence change where possible by simplifying communications and the
      way information is presented as our approach to reduce cognitive burden and
      improve understanding and readability.


      We will continue our quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work
      including medical disability reviews.


      For improper payments within the agency’s control, we will continue to invest
      in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly
      systems and tools to better serve the public.  To meet the challenges of our
      growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we will streamline
      our procedures and automate more of our business processes.  We will enhance
      the quality of training to better equip our workforce.


      For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we are addressing the challenge
      of reliance on self-reporting by promoting timely wage reporting and issuing
      reminders on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to utilize an automated information
      exchange with commercial payroll data providers to reduce the reliance on self-reporting
      of wages.  This exchange is referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange.  We
      plan to continue current computer-matching agreements (CMAs) that yield a positive
      cost-benefit ratio, expand effective CMAs to meet additional program needs,
      research current programs, work with internal stakeholders to identify data
      exchange needs, and pursue new data exchanges with potential partners.'
    act17_2: 'The primary cause of improper payments within the agency’s control is
      our failure to take timely and proper actions.  The primary cause of improper
      payments outside the agency’s control occurs when we are unable to access data
      needed to calculate a payment because the beneficiary or a third-party either
      did not provide the requested information or provided inaccurate information
      necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  It occurs because of beneficiaries
      or representative payees’ failure to report changes.  For this reporting period,
      consistent with prior years, much of the overpayments continue to be attributed
      to employment.  Therefore, to address improper payments caused by inability
      to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information
      needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing
      new wage reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial
      payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act
      of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  PIE will
      allow us to receive monthly wage and employment information automatically through
      an information exchange with a participating payroll data provider and it will
      improve payment accuracy, reduce improper payments, and reduce the reporting
      burden on individuals when they authorize us to obtain this information through
      an information exchange and we receive it.  We also anticipate that implementation
      of an information exchange will result in more efficient use of our limited
      administrative resources because our technicians would reduce the amount of
      time they spend:  manually requesting this information from payroll data providers
      and employers; manually entering data into our systems from an individual’s
      pay records; contacting individuals; and assisting individuals with the results
      of incomplete or untimely reporting.'

      controls to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship
      responsibilities and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested

    cyp20_2: We have been maintaining a high payment accuracy rate.  We strive to
      pay the right person, the right amount at the right time to reduce improper
      payments.  We have centralized the coordination and monitoring of agency-wide
      improper payment initiatives.  We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment
      Strategies to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of
      leading causes of improper payments.
    rap5: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that
      has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
      existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
      assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and
      operating effectively.


      As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
      management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
      Act.


      We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
      membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
      clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


      Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent
      on having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our
      employees who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for
      benefits and other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is
      critical to maintain a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship
      work.


      Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
      to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
      investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
      digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and
      mobile accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital
      services that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers
      to service to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and
      employees.  We are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service
      while reducing manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient
      funding is necessary to continue to modernize our IT.


      Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
      information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
      to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
      controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
      and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
      a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on
      continuous improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support
      of Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of
      Management and Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero
      Trust Cybersecurity Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital
      identity processes to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic
      Services for Constituents Act.


      Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
      network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
      cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
      partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
      flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.'
    rap6: The fiscal year 2025 President’s Budget included resources for internal
      controls to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship
      responsibilities and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested
      $1.903 billion in dedicated funding for program integrity activities.  Many
      of the tools we use, such as our medical Continuing Disability Reviews, work
      Continuing Disability Reviews, and the Cooperative Disability Investigations
      program, save billions of program dollars with a proportionally small investment
      of administrative resources.
