    in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs.  Direct certification
    is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification error in
    Local Education Agency processing of household applications.


    As a part of the overall strategy to improve processes and technology for State
    agencies, FNS will distribute the funding available to improve State systems and

    cyp4_1: Overpayments are outside of the agency's control because Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a state-managed federal
      program. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The
      activity that gives rise to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies
      and sponsors (schools and school food authorities or school districts) determine
      children’s eligibility for program benefits and serve meals to children. All
      of this activity occurs prior to the point that states submit claims to FNS
      for federal payment. Although FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does
      engage in extensive training, issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity
      audits in an effort to help states, and the local organizations under their
      oversight, improve program performance and limit program error.
  rap5: The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) does not have an administrative infrastructure
    for producing yearly estimates of improper payment rates and dollar values. Therefore,
    Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility,
    and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for
    NSLP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline
    data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators.
  rap6: "In order to establish and maintain internal controls in the National School\
    \ Lunch Program (NSLP), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has requested the following\
    \ budget increases to the Child Nutrition Block, of which NSLP is included (Source:\
    \  2023 USDA Explanatory Notes - Food and Nutrition Service): \n\n(14) An increase\
    \ of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance ($34,214,000 estimated\
    \ in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary\
    \ to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to\
    \ ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. A change\
    \ of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases to\
    \ state and local index trends. \nAn additional $10 million increase is for three\
    \ current law proposals:\n• The first current law proposal increases funding by\
    \ $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS provides\
    \ tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver specific\
    \ programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program proposal,\
    \ the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special Supplemental\
    \ Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program\
    \ Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for more\
    \ detail under the NPA section of this document. \n• The second proposal is for\
    \ $6 million for FNS to restore the ability to provide timely program technical\
    \ support. This proposal addresses ability to better respond to state and local\
    \ policy and operational issues and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’\
    \ Ability to Provide Timely Program Technical Support” current law proposal for\
    \ more details. \n• The third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated\
    \ grants management and contract resources. Currently FNS manages 700 active CNP\
    \ grants and expects to award another $100 million in new grants to States, tribes,\
    \ schools and districts, non-profit organizations, and agricultural producers\
    \ in \nFY 2023. The proposal, entitled, “Provide Dedicated Staff for Development,\
    \ Management and Oversight of Program Specific Grant Programs and Procurements”\
    \ addresses this need and can be referenced further within this document.    \n\
    \n(15) An increase of $5,706,000 for Child Nutrition (CN) Studies ($15,299,000\
    \ estimated in FY 2022). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related\
    \ activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help\
    \ ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This\
    \ line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CNP, including the federal\
    \ staff needed to oversee this vital work. The change consists of $87,000 for\
    \ pay costs, $619,000 to match state and local index trends, and $5 million for\
    \ a current law proposal titled, “Feasibility study for a national system for\
    \ State reviews of CNPs,” to complete a feasibility study for a national system\
    \ for State reviews of CNPs. \n\n(16) An increase of $888,000 for CN Payment Accuracy\
    \ ($11,427,000 estimated in FY 2022). This funding supports FNS’ robust Federal\
    \ oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification,\
    \ prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. The increase consists of $462,000\
    \ to match state and local index trends and $426,000 due to pay cost."
  rnp3: "Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) expects that the overall improvement of\
    \ information technology systems by non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant\
    \ recipients administering National School Lunch Program (NSLP) will improve the\
    \ State Agency's ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and\

      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the National
      School Lunch Program (NSLP) to encourage adoption of a FNS-developed tool to
      reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the DVS
      is an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit
      data to their States.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      Through a rulemaking effective October 26, 2023, the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) lowered the eligibility threshold for school participation in the CEP
      from an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) of 40% to 25%. FNS research shows
      that schools participating in CEP have notably lower certification error than
      schools that do not participate. Based on these findings, FNS expects that increased
      CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction
      in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule
      was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we
      expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from
      this change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.  FNS released supporting
      guidance material, including a fact sheet, published February, 2024.


      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      FNS is engaged in research related to integrity in the National School Lunch
      Program(NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). APEC IV has completed data collection
      and will soon move on to analyzing data to establish an NSLP/SBP improper payment
      (IP) rate. With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use
      a new baseline estimate for IP in NSLP and SBP, improving our projected error
      rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study
      also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications.
      From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in
      online applications used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price
      meals.


      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and State administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS
      released guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023.


      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address IP challenges that cannot
      be remedied through monitoring alone.


      Direct Certification with Medicaid Demonstration (DC-M)

      FNS approved 5 new states to participate in the DC-M Projects for school year
      (SY) 2024-2025. Once the 5 new states implement the DC-M matching, the total
      number of states participating in DC-M will be 43. FNS research confirms that
      participation in DC-M improves program integrity by replacing the traditional
      household application for school meal benefits with an automated data match
      against existing household income records.

    cyp4_1: Overpayments are outside of the agency's control because Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) programs are state-managed federal programs. As such, program
      payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies (SAs), which then pass
      through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The activity that gives rise
      to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies and sponsors (schools
      and school food authorities or school districts) determine children’s eligibility
      for program benefits and serve meals to children. All of this activity occurs
      prior to the point that states submit claims to FNS for federal payment. Although
      FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does engage in extensive training,
      issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity audits in an effort to help
      states, and the local organizations under their oversight, improve program performance
      and limit program error.
  rap5: The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) does not have an administrative infrastructure

    \ and Technical Assistance ($45,996,000 and 59 FTE available in 2024). \nEffective\
    \ and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States\
    \ properly administer the Child Nutrition (CN) Programs and to ensure States are\
    \ equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This includes a total of $17.1\
    \ million for current law proposals, $3.8 million of which is for a 2025 proposal\
    \ and $13.3 million is for 2024 re-proposals. The requested increase includes\
    \ $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Increase\
    \ Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation, $1.3 million\
    \ and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation and\
    \ oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current Law\
    \ Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the CN Payment\
    \ Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget lines. The next current\
    \ law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff to support the 2024 Current Law\
    \ Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical Assistance, which enhances the\
    \ Food and Nutrition Service’s ability to provide critical training, technical\
    \ assistance, and oversight to ensure program integrity and compliance with Federal\
    \ law and regulations for child nutrition in both national and regional offices.\
    \ The fourth current law proposal for $2 million is to support the 2024 Current\
    \ Law Re-proposal: Enterprise Risk Management: helps with approaches in FNS strategic\
    \ planning and program operations. The remaining increase is due to inflation\
    \ and 2025 pay cost. \n\nAn increase of $2,743,000 in CN Studies ($21,005,000\

    \ and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers\
    \ and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively,\
    \ which include improving public health, nutrition, and equity. This program line\
    \ supports the critical evaluations needed for the CN Programs, including the\
    \ Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The request includes $2 million\
    \ for the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Research on the U.S. Territories. The remaining\
    \ increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.\n\nAn increase of $9,248,000\
    \ and 28 FTE in CN Payment Accuracy ($12,315,000 and 72 FTE available in 2024).\n\
    This funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight, monitoring, and technical\
    \ assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention, and resolution\
    \ of erroneous payments. This includes a total of $8.2 million for current law\
    \ proposals: $4 million and 20 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal:\
    \ Investment in Regional Financial Management for Program Integrity, which helps\
    \ regional Grants Management and Administrative Services (GMAS) Staff across CN\

    \ the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Strengthen the Child and Adult Care Food Program\
    \ (CACFP) Program Integrity, which will spread through a variety of activities\
    \ including data mining and a technical assistance support center designed to\
    \ support States in identifying and addressing program integrity risks. The third\
    \ current law is for $1.2 million and 8 staff to support the 2024 Current Law\

  rnp3: 'Process Change - Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

    The Food and Nutrition service (FNS) expects that increased CEP eligibility will
    correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction in certification error,
    and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule was published after the
    CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we expect that the full magnitude
    of decreases in improper payments resulting from change will not fully be observed
    until SY2024-2025.


    Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

    With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use a new baseline
    estimate for improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and
    School Breakfast Program (SBP), improving our projected error rates by starting
    with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study also includes a component
    that examines integrity features of online applications. From this sub-study,
    FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications used
    by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.


    Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

    FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs,
    at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help
    FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types, resulting
    in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program requirements.
    Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows states to adopt
    a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously
    States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt a
    review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based criteria
    to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows States to direct
    limited resources where attention is needed most.


    The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
    integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges
    that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.


    Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)

    Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified for
    free meals without the need for a household application based on household participation
    in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct certification
    is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification error in
    Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.



    Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)

    FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by
    nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State''s ability to train,
    monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.


    Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

    FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to encourage
    adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative
    data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is an Application Programming
    Interface (API) that States can include in their platforms for collecting data
    from their school districts. The DVS provides real-time edit checks and error
    messages to school districts as they submit data to their States.'
  rnp4: Program sponsors and operators have binding agreements with the administering
    State Agencies (SAs) to operate Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) National School
    Lunch Program (NSLP) according to all program rules. SAs have binding agreements
    with FNS to administer the Federal programs in accordance with applicable regulations,
    guidance, and instructions. FNS has a robust review process that includes state-level
    review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of SAs to ensure program
    integrity in NSLP. Additionally, at the federal level, senior executives are held
    responsible for program oversight and integrity via the annual strategic planning
    process and performance system.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is committed to ensuring integrity in the
    National School Lunch Program (NSLP) in order to protect taxpayer dollars and
    safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on during the school year.
    Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable rate for
    NSLP that fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while executing the
    program's processes to the maximum possible effect as allowed under statute.

Description: 'The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal
  program

  operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions.
  It

  reimburses participating schools and institutions for the cost of providing meals
  to eligible children. NSLP overpayments are primarily due to errors in determining
  children''s eligibility for program benefits. Errors in counting and claiming meals
  for federal reimbursement is a secondary source of over payment. The most significant
  barrier to prevention is the decentralized nature of the program. Certifying children
  for benefits and counting meals for reimbursement are handled independently by tens
  of thousands of schools and school districts.'
