  rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department
    can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently
    in Phase II. The DoD Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the
    previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an
    inappropriate variable which led to insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete
    universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population
    for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations
    by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify
    the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite
    Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population to create the samples
    from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams have collaborated and
    have a specific formula that has been approved by the DoD OIG to produce more
    reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing higher and lower risk
    payment types accordingly. This new formula and process will produce estimates
    that are more reliable and streamline the Department’s efforts to achieve Payment
    Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during the FY 2023 Payment Integrity
    compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD OIG confirmed reliable estimates,
    the Department will be able to establish effective and cost beneficial tolerable
    rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

      Reclamation Process. This was in preparation of an Internal Review audit slated
      for June 2023 which further tested Disbursing’s reclamation process. Military
      Retirement pursued efforts with Treasury and Veteran Affairs to implement the
      use of the Treasury's Do Not Pay (DNP) database. During Military Retirement’s
      testing it was determined that pertinent death data was missing. As a result,
      Military Retirement pursued receiving data through Experian, it has been determined
      that this source also does not contain all pertinent data and Military Retirement
      and DMDC (Defense Manpower Data Center) are working to reengage with SSA (Social
      Security Administration) to be effective in calendar year 2024. Additionally,
      Military Retirement is pursuing Treasury's DNP for future use as DNP is working
      to obtain the missing data directly from the SSA Death Master file. Military
      Retirement has partnered with other agencies as a part of the Payment Integrity
      Center of Excellence working group, which focuses on synchronization of interagency
      efforts to streamline multiple lines of corrective action efforts and effectiveness
      in reducing IP and UP. The Working Group was established during Q1 FY 2023.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: The Military Retirement program received two errors in FY 2023 related
    to unknown payments. Both errors were related to insufficient/missing documentation.
    For the missing Survivor Benefit Package (SBP), Military Retirement has controls
    and procedures in place that prevent erroneous SBP elections and enrolls the member
    in auto SBP coverage when SBP election documentation is not received. In response
    to both errors, after reviewing the accounts in its entirety, the Military Retirement
    did have the documentation on file to support the actions taken when the accounts
    were established. Both documents appear to have been lost during a system migration
    and prior to Military Retirement being reabsorbed into DFAS. In order to conclude
    whether or not these payments are proper or improper, the Military Retirement
    will need to receive documentation from both the payee and the Branch of Service.
  cyp8: Out of 2,114 samples reviewed, the Military Retirement program had two Unknown
    payment samples in FY 2023, which were related to insufficient documentation.
    In both cases, the errors were attributable to not having complete retirement
    packages available. However, the errors are different in that the first sample
    required documentation from the payee, while the other account required documentation
    from the Branch of Service. In both cases, the Military Retirement Operations
    has requested the documentation from the appropriate parties and will continue
    to track until documentation is received.

      altogether is unrealistic. However, closer attention to details could prevent
      certain errors. Reduction in human errors would prevent and reduce overall improper
      payments. Furthermore, the corrective actions employed by the Defense Finance
      and Accounting Service Military Retirement Operations team in Fiscal Year (FY)
      2023 significantly reduced monetary loss errors resulted in the program's removal
      from the previous OMB High Priority program status going into FY 2024.

      paying deceased members including monthly SSA death match. It is still nearly
      impossible to prevent every payment to a deceased member due to timing of death
      and method of notification. Significant progress in lowering Monetary Loss outside
      of the Agency control was realized in FY 2023 through the corrective actions
      employed and the partnership with the Veterans Affairs Administration. In FY
      2022, there was a projected Monetary Loss outside of the Agency control of $318.10
      million; however, in FY 2023 that amount was reduced down to $264 thousand.
  rap5: "Internal Controls:\nThe Department has internal controls in place to support\
    \ the reduction of improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the\
    \ levels the Department has targeted. As part of the internal control framework\
    \ for this program, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Director\
    \ of Retired and Annuitant (R&A) Pay has identified and documented known risks\
    \ associated with the processes for providing pay services to the customers of\
    \ the Military Retirement program. Along with identifying these risks by process,\
    \ the Director of R&A Pay instituted key controls and control activities over\
    \ pre-review of payments and certifying officer legislation and developed an internal\
    \ post-payment review process to mitigate the documented risks. The Director also\
    \ tests the controls to ensure their effectiveness and documents the test results.\
    \ \n\nHuman Capital:\nCurrently, the Department has the appropriate human capital,\
    \ specifically within the DFAS Military Retirement Operations section, it needs\
    \ to reduce improper and unknown payments in the Military Retirement program to\
    \ the levels the Department has targeted. \n\nInformation Systems and Other Infrastructure:\n\
    The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to\
    \ reduce improper payments in the Military Retirement program to the levels the\
    \ Department has targeted. Moreover, the Disbursing Service for the Department,\
    \ is projected to receive an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC)\
    \ 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE)\
    \ No. 18 in FY 2023. As technology advances, the Department continues to consider\
    \ improving the accuracy and efficiency of Military Retirement through implementation\
    \ of new retiree and annuitant pay systems and enhancements to existing systems."
  rap6: For the Department's Military Retirement Payment Integrity program, Retired
    and Annuitant (R&A) pay is unaware of any specific budget requests related to
    Payment Integrity. R&A is confident in the ability of the current workforce and
    available information systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments.
  rnp3: The Department's Military Retirement program program has significantly decreased
    Improper (IP) and Unknown payments (UP). The combined projected IP and UP amounts
    in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 was $418.83 Million and decreased to $146.36 Million
    in FY 2023. Specifically, the greatest reduction was realized in Monetary loss
    (both inside and outside the Agency control designation). In FY 2022, there was
    a combined $318.10 Million in monetary losses, which was reduced to $75.49 Million
    in FY 2023. The reduction of IP and UP is a clear indication of more than adequate
    corrective actions taken coupled with successfully removing the Military Retirement
    program from the OMB High Priority list going into FY 2024. Furthermore, the Department,
    through deliberate synchronized efforts with the subject matter experts within
    the DFAS Military Retirement Operations, have strategically crafted additional
    corrective actions that are highly anticipated to continue to reduce IP and UP
    to the tolerable levels underneath the OMB statutory threshold in FY 2024. Once
    the corrective actions are fully implemented mainly the increase in data integrity
    both in scope and timeliness, continued evolvement and enhancement of systems
    coupled with the strategic mission area realignment, the Department is confident
    that the Military Retirement portfolio will achieve PIIA Compliance during the
    FY 2024 audit.
