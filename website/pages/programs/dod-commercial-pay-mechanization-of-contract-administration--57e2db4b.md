    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program does
      not have a formal corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on current
      year findings. Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the
      Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual
      improper payments plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the
      current reporting year, the Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program reported
      an estimated total of $96.29 million of improper plus unknown payments, which
      is only 0.04 percent of the total outlays. Hence, no specific corrective actions
      were taken for this program. The Department pursues continuous training actions
      for current and new employees throughout the Commercial Pay MOCAS program. Additionally,
      through trend and root cause analysis, specific training is provided to prevent
      improper payments from technician error. For root causes other than technician
      error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault (i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana
      detection tool is continually monitored and evaluated to rank and rate proposed
      integrity checks to identify and prevent improper payments in the pre-payment
      environment.

  act17_2: The Department's Commercial Pay MOCAS program did not have a formal corrective
    action plan based on current year findings. Specifically, corrective action plans
    are required under the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a
    program's total annual improper payments plus unknown payments exceed the statutory
    threshold. In the current reporting year, the Department's Commercial Pay program
    reported a total of $96.3 million in improper plus unknown payments, which is
    below the statutory threshold.
  act17_3: 'Although below the statutory threshold, the $96 million in improper and
    unknown payments made by the Department under the Commercial Pay - MOCAS program
    should be preventable based on the following processes and controls: (1) The agency
    contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the payment terms are
    entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification is received;
    (2) The agency is also responsible for verifying the accuracy of the payment,
    to include payment terms, prior to release; (3) Requiring that prior to payment,
    entitlement technicians complete a review of the contract and supporting documentation;
    (4) A procedure is in place for any payments greater than $1 million to undergo
    secondary review to ensure entitlements are legal, proper, and correct; and (5)
    The contract input team utilizes a daily report to track contracts and modifications
    received to ensure timely input into the system. The above controls are being
    reviewed to determine how they can be strengthened and if additional training
    or controls are needed.

    cyp2_1: The Department’s Payment Integrity Commercial Pay – Mechanization of Contract
      Administration Services (MOCAS) program focuses on commercial vendors who deliver
      goods to or perform services for the DoD. The Department’s contractual payments
      require a three-way match between contract, invoice, and goods receipt and acceptance.
      Through internal controls and prepayment authorizations, overpayments are usually
      prevented. The Department's overpayments within the agency control under the
      Commercial Pay – MOCAS program in FY 2024 were mainly attributed to human input
      error. During the FY 2024 post-payment reviews of the program, it was found
      that payment terms were entered incorrectly into MOCAS when contract modifications
      were implemented. These overpayments are classified as within agency control
      because the contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the payment
      terms are entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification
      is received. The contract input team is also responsible for verifying the accuracy
      of the payment, to include payment terms, prior to release. The Department has
      several controls in place to prevent overpayments from occurring, including
      requiring that prior to payment, entitlement technicians complete a review of
      the contract and supporting documentation.  In addition, a procedure is in place
      for any payments greater than $1 million to undergo secondary review to ensure
      entitlements are legal, proper, and correct.  The contract input team also utilizes
      a daily report to track contracts and modifications received to ensure timely
      input into the system.  The above controls that failed are being reviewed to
      determine how they can be strengthened and to determine if additional training
      or controls are needed.

  rap5: 'Internal Controls:

    The Department has the internal controls in place to support the reduction of
    improper payments in the Commercial Pay – MOCAS program to the levels the Department
    has targeted. However, a material weakness in Contract Administration related
    to improper payments was reported in fiscal year (FY) 2021 through the Risk Management/Internal
    Control Program. Moreover, the Office of the Under Secretary of the Defense (Comptroller)
    provides ongoing oversight to ensure material weaknesses are resolved by their
    target dates and coordination continues between the Risk Management/Internal Control
    Program and the Payment Integrity Program to leverage best practices in internal
    controls.


    Human Capital:

    The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the
    Commercial Pay – MOCAS program to the levels the Department has targeted. However,
    as the Commercial Pay -MOCAS program evolves and DoD operations change, additional
    skill sets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


    Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

    The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to
    reduce improper payments in the Commercial Pay - MOCAS program to the levels the
    Department has targeted. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Contract
    Pay, received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report
    under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2024.
    The general and application controls of the Mechanization of Contract Administration
    Services System (which accounts for more than 50% of the outlays of all Commercial
    Pay programs) were included in the scope of the DFAS Contract Pay SSAE No. 18
    examination. As technology advances, the Department continues to consider ways
    to improve the accuracy and efficiency of commercial pay through implementation
    of new commercial and entitlement processing systems and enhancements to existing
    systems.'
  rap6: The MOCAS Commercial Pay program did not have any recent specific Payment
    Integrity budget submissions that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
    (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team is aware. Furthermore, the Department is
    not aware outside the normal system upgrade requirements that will require additional
    resources.
  rnp3: The Department's Commercial Pay - MOCAS program will not have a formal corrective
    action plan based on current year findings. Specifically, corrective action plans
    are required under the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a
    program's total annual improper payments plus unknown payments exceed the statutory
    threshold. In the current reporting year, the Department's Commercial Pay - MOCAS
    program reported a total of $96.3 million in improper plus unknown payments, which
    is below the statutory threshold. The Department's existing controls to address
    improper and unknown payments under the Commercial Pay - MOCAS program are being
    reviewed to determine how they can be strengthened and if additional training
    or controls are needed to address potential deficiencies. DFAS Post Pay Review
    & Analysis team will provide training to review teams regarding proper documentation
    required for government credit card transactions. This Training will be provided
    to the review teams during the annual kick off meeting on the appropriate documentation
    required to complete sample packages along with specific examples of acceptable
    documentation. Additionally, through trend and root cause analysis, specific training
    will be provided to prevent technician error improper payments. In cases when
    the root cause is for other than technician error, the issue will be addressed
    with the applicable party at fault i.e., contracting personal, receiving entities
    and systemic controls.
  rnp4: 'Within the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), all Commercial
    Pay operations are responsible for tracking OMB metrics, proper payment count
    and dollars. Metrics are tracked monthly and updates are provided to the Director
    of DFAS at least three times per year. A green rating for this metric is greater
    than or equal to 99.6%, yellow is less than 99.6% and greater than or equal to
    99.0% and red is less than 99.0%. Management must provide narratives and/or Corrective
    Action Plans for Red and Yellow ratings. At the operational level, entitlement
    technicians are held accountable through appraisal standards which limit them
    to no more than 5 errors per quarter, certifying official appraisal standards
    hold them to no more than 1% of payments certified during the rating period identified
    as improper. In addition, certifying officials have pecuniary liability for loss
    of funds unless relieved. Managers have overall responsibility to ensure metric
    targets are met and maintained.


    Furthermore, the Department of Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials
    Steering Committee (the Committee) was created in FY 2018, and it institutionalized
    a forum of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required
    by Appendix C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with
    the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired
    by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial
    Officer and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy Director
    of Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives from
    the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The Committee provides oversight to
    the DoD Payment Integrity program and drives action for compliance with the PIIA.
    More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of improper payments testing,
    the root causes of improper payments and appropriate actions to reduce them, payment
    recovery activities, and solutions to resolve DoD-wide audit findings and recommendations
    related to improper payments. Additionally, the Committee supports audits related
    to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations, performance of risk assessments
    and oversees the identification of root cause(s) and the development and implementation
    of corrective actions to address areas of noncompliance.'
