  pro1: "In FY 2019, net Premium Tax Credits (PTC) were determined to be susceptible\
    \ to significant improper payments due to the dollar amount of overclaims.  However,\
    \ Treasury notified OMB that it would delay the annual reporting of improper payments\
    \ for PTC.  In the interim, Treasury collaborated with the HHS to develop a joint\
    \ methodology for assessing improper payment risk for PTC.  The PTC program is\
    \ operationally divided between HHS and Treasury.  The HHS, through the Centers\
    \ for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), administers advance payments to insurance\
    \ providers on behalf of applicants/taxpayers through the federally facilitated\
    \ exchange. These payments are referred to as advance payments of the Premium\
    \ Tax Credit (advance PTC or APTC).  Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service\
    \ (IRS) administer the federal income tax return process where a tax credit (payment\
    \ or zero are other possibilities) is based on reconciliation of APTC amounts\
    \ with final allowable PTC determined in tax filing.  Payment of this credit is\
    \ referred to as net PTC. \n\nHHS will report APTC in its improper payment table\
    \ within its Agency Financial report (AFR).  Treasury will report net PTC in its\
    \ improper payment table within its AFR.  Both Departments will disclose the combined\
    \ advance and net PTC rates in their AFRs.  To satisfy reporting to OMB and paymentaccurracy.gov\
    \ requirements, CMS will report disbursements/outlays, estimated error rate, and\
    \ other data for APTC.  The IRS will similarly report estimated overclaims and\
    \ error rate for net PTC.  The combined advance and net PTC rates are for informational\
    \ purposes only and will not be included in either Department’s overall improper\
    \ payment rate and will not be reported to PaymentAccuracy.gov.\n"
  rap5: To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
    Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal Year
    2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5 billion
    to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment. If
    the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial  loss
    in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the IRS
    would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to audits
    of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial burden
    on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating
    the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such,
    IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is
    a more efficient and cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax
    collections. We further support the reporting of RTC overclaims within the Tax
    Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative
    to the U.S. tax system.
  rap6: 'For FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its
    Budget submission:

    (1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers.

    The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the
    Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal tax
    returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.


    (2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing –

    The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance
    or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers. First,
    it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers
    for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of
    noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal
    would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification
    Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification

    Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.
    Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty
    for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from
    three years to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify the

    Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate
    in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions
    to protect the integrity of the e-file program.'
  rnp3: 'The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before
    payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct
    the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools,
    including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent

    the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates
    a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim
    one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers
    make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a

    disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times
    the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant
    portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative
    perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs

    counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.


    The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.
    Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely
    attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and
    not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies or
    reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable
    credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit
    considerations. The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance
    plan that addresses erroneous claims. Therefore, legislative changes are the most
    effective means of addressing the causes of these improper payments.'

  cyp20_2: 'The FY 2024 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2023
    Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments will
    be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited

    authority to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most
    of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors that
    are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies
    on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party

    sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility
    requirements and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments.
    Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive
    examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources
    to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through
    this process are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated for
    the program. Without legislative change to greatly improve effective tools to
    administer these credits, the improper payment rate

    cyp4_1: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC), to include the lack of a preapproval
      process (notwithstanding anything that occurs in the Advance PTC process) and
      IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is
      the primary root cause of Net PTC improper payments. Specifically, at the time
      of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily verify certain information, i.e.,
      taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income
      where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. This is due to
      the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does
      not exist. In addition, each year there are many taxpayers who receive PTC for
      the first time, who have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory
      structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including
      Net PTC, prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior
      to making a refund.
  pro1: Treasury collaborated with the HHS to develop a joint methodology for assessing
    improper payment risk for PTC. The PTC program is operationally divided between
    HHS and Treasury. The HHS, through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
    (CMS), administers advance payments to insurance providers on behalf of applicants/taxpayers
    through the federally facilitated exchange. These payments are referred to as
    advance payments of the Premium Tax Credit (advance PTC or APTC). Treasury and
    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administer the federal income tax return process
    where a tax credit (payment or zero are other possibilities) is based on reconciliation
    of APTC amounts with final allowable PTC determined in tax filing. Payment of
    this credit is referred to as net PTC. HHS will report APTC in its improper payment
    table within its Agency Financial report (AFR). Treasury will report net PTC in
    its improper payment table within its AFR. Both Departments will disclose the
    combined advance and net PTC rates in their AFRs. To satisfy reporting to OMB
    and paymentaccurracy.gov requirements, CMS will report disbursements/outlays,
    estimated error rate, and other data for APTC. The IRS will similarly report estimated
    overclaims and error rate for net PTC. The combined advance and net PTC rates
    are for informational purposes only and will not be included in either Department’s
    overall improper payment rate and will not be reported to PaymentAccuracy.gov.
  rap5: The IRS has support with respect to internal control, human capital and information
    system and other infrastructure to reduce Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC) Improper
    Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with PTC is statutory
    program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification. The IRS has a strong
    internal control environment around PTC  and makes decisions based on overall
    cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically capable program
    staff.
  rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
    its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number of
    correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits, including
    the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Focusing on helping taxpayer submit accurate
    filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative burdens
    for the IRS and the tax filer.
  rnp3: The IRS has the ability to identify Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC) errors by
    type. Correlating remediation efforts to success is challenging. Given its limited
    authority to directly prevent and stop these errors, the IRS focuses on positively
    influencing taxpayer behavior and working with paid preparers and tax preparation
    software/online filing service providers. Further, the IRS has sought legislative
    authority to enhance verification procedures for taxpayers claiming the PTC. Taxpayer
    education and outreach efforts, such as the IRS's annual Dependent Database (DDb)
    meetings, inform taxpayers about program eligibility requirements.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
    the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements
      with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services (CMS) to access critical information that aids in validating
      eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC). This data-sharing involves the
      exchange of key data points, such as income thresholds and enrollment in a qualified
      health plan. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether
      taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements for the PTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing
      allows the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as the taxpayer
      not being in a qualified health plan and prevent improper payments during the
      return processing stage. An additional root cause of improper payments of refundable
      tax credits (RTCs), in addition to data needed does not exist and inability
      to access data, is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility
      requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information,
      taxpayers may inaccurately claim the PTC due to misunderstanding income limits
      or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from CMS, the IRS can
      verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given the lack
      of a pre-approval process for these credits.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines
      the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors;
      this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process.
      As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management,
      the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is
      reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of
      a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility
      for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved
      compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before
      payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result
      of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
      quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits
      and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
      issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting

      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Premium
      Tax Credit (PTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next filing season.
      This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune criteria
      used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from prior
      filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters, the
      IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned, throughout

      the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as the taxpayer not
      being in a qualified health plan and prevent improper payments during the return
      processing stage. An additional root cause of improper payments of refundable
      tax credits (RTCs), in addition to data needed does not exist and inability
      to access data, is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility
      requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information,
      taxpayers may inaccurately claim the Premium Tax Credit due to misunderstanding
      income limits or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from CMS,
      the IRS can verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given
      the lack of a pre-approval process for these credits.

  act17_1: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
    such as the Premium Tax Credit (Net PTC), is the complexity of the credits'' statutory
    eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes of RTC improper payments
    are as follows: (1) the lack of a pre-approval process and inability to authenticate
    eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding
    of key points of eligibility, especially for self-employment or other income not
    reported to the IRS by third-parties; and (3) the inability for the IRS to wholesale
    deny refunds. Because of these root causes, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification
    of an accurate return. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions
    focused on mitigating these root causes. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings
    focus on reviewing and adjusting compliance filters used in audit selection, which
    allows the IRS to detect errors earlier. The IRS also cross-collaborates with
    the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration
    (SSA) and the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would
    enable the IRS to identify discrepancies in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS
    has invested in taxpayer education and outreach efforts, through such venues as
    the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax Fest, to educate tax preparers
    about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer eligibility before filing claims.
    The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly,
    the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting
    additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
    quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits
    and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
    issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. All
    of these corrective actions are strategically designed to address the root causes
    of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating
    the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
  act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks
    a pre-approval process and causes the IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification
    that their returns claiming RTCs are accurate, is a key factor contributing to
    RTC improper payments. Despite these constraints, the IRS has strategically designed
    corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments by improving
    the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating the risks associated with taxpayer

    on mitigating these root causes. The IRS prioritizes its corrective actions based
    on the magnitude of the root causes they address and the potential impact of each
    action on reducing improper payments. Data-driven analyses are critical in determining
    which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further
    its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach
    and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping
    taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds
    and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible,
    the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing
    the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. The IRS ensures that its corrective actions
    are continuously monitored, effectively implemented and reprioritized based on
    their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: 'The FY 2025 estimated improper payment rate is the same as the FY 2024
    improper payment rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in refundable tax credit (RTC)
    improper payments will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such

    that IRS has limited authority to make changes to the claims during return processing.
    More so, most of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends
    on factors that are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The
    IRS heavily relies on taxpayer provided information without verifiability

    by third-party sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around
    eligibility requirements and is one of the major contributing factors to improper
    payments. Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming
    and resource-intensive examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does
    not have the resources to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments
    able to be attained through this process are small relative to the amount of improper
    payments estimated for the program. Without legislative change to greatly improve
    effective tools to administer these credits, the improper payment rate will not
    change significantly.'

    cyp4_1: These overpayments outside of the agency control include the inability
      to authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      outside of the agency control also include the inability to authenticate data
      due to program design limitations. Barriers caused by program design occur when
      information needed to confirm payment accuracy is not available at the time
      the return is processed.
  rap5: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
    (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with
    RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Treasury
    Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported that
    the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
  rap6: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs will\
    \ take actions beyond our control.  We have proposed various legislative changes\
    \ over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For\
    \ the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the following proposals:\n\
    \n1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal\
    \ would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate\
    \ behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would\
    \ increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful,\
    \ reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance\
    \ that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish\
    \ new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs)\
    \ and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose\
    \ the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal would increase the\
    \ limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s\
    \ identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the\
    \ proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and\
    \ suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including\
    \ setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file\
    \ program.  \n\n2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal\
    \ would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary\
    \ with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns,\
    \ including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese\
    \ statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
    \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data sources\
    \ through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and additional\
    \ time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
  rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
    do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
    root causes of the Premium Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there
    is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale
    deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims
    of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data
    source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer
    self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within
    and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower
    level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there''s an
    inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility
    rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing with many nuances);
    (b) there''s instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related
    to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third
    party; and (c) there''s a turnover of taxpayer who receive certain credits for
    the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the
    credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability
    to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the
    IRS''s information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS
    uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules compliance and payment certification.
    The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing with
    other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts aid the Service in mitigating
    the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of outreach and
    education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers understand the
    program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.'
  rnp4: "The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit\
    \ programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.\
    \  The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan\
    \ that addresses erroneous claims.  Each year the IRS updates its strategy using\
    \ the most recent research findings, prior year audit results, TIGTA/GAO audit\
    \ findings and legislative updates.  The IRS also submits legislative proposals\
    \ which, if approved by Congress, may further enhance efforts to address areas\
    \ of risk and reduce improper payments. \n \nThe IRS reviews and updates Internal\
    \ Revenue Manuals throughout the year and ensures that IRS employees who administer\
    \ refundable credits receive annual training and have the requisite knowledge\
    \ to address the evolving nature of improper payments and fraud.  Employees are\
    \ also encouraged to recommend changes that may further strengthen the IRS's internal\
    \ controls and procedures.\n \nThe IRS performance plans also balance the outreach\
    \ and awareness component with its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to\
    \ find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the knowledge of taxpayers\
    \ and paid return preparers of the eligibility and criteria for RTCs.\n\nReducing\
    \ the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
    \ restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not yet been\

    \ decisions for RTCs are made by the taxpayer during the filing process. \n\n\
    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
