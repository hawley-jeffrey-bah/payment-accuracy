    assumes flat funding for the current year +1 estimate, so the reduction target
    was used to calculate IP and UPs. The corrective actions implemented in FY22 that
    may reduce the future rates are targeting unknown payments, therefore that is

  rap5: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
    of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
    improper payments via five-pronged approach. Via the strategic plan that agency
    is committing resources – human capital, internal controls, and information systems,
    to reduce improper payments.
  rap6: AmeriCorps did not request resources.
  rnp3: The improper payments reported are made that the grantee level. The improper
    payments are not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary
    loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s
    grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine if
    the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct control
    over the payments, it is implanting updated, comprehensive trainings to ensure
    the grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.
    The agency has elevated the reduction of improper payments to be a key performance
    indicator in its strategic plan.

      has a Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group that includes accountable
      program officials and key agency stakeholders. The working group has created
      training and resources targeted at the root cause drivers of improper payments
      which are available on the agency’s website or grantee training platform (LITMOS).
      The working group plans to analyze the FY 2023 improper payments root cause
      drivers and explore opportunities to create new resources or expand on those
      that currently exist in FY 2024.

    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps had established a Payment Integrity Corrective
      Action Plan working group. Using improper and unknown payments information from
      AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment, the working group has identified
      the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments. Based on this
      information, the group has created resources and delivered training focused
      on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. Those trainings were
      available to grantees for FY 2023. The agency also provided resolution packets
      to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2022 assessment, linking specific root
      cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment.
