      This has and will significantly reduce the burden to borrowers who are submitting

    this root cause, FSA developed a corrective action plan to implement the authorities
    provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from
    the IRS, which is expected to significantly reduce misreported income on the FAFSA.
    In FY 2024, FSA implemented the FAFSA Processing System (FPS) and Federal Tax
    Information (FTI) systems to automatically provide a student and families’ federal
    tax information to FSA for the 2024–25 FAFSA form. In FY 2025, FSA will continue
    to implement the FUTURE Act FAFSA solution for students and families with individual
    taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) during the 2026–27 FAFSA cycle.


    FSA has and will continue to publish and deliver various free trainings, guidance,
    and resources for school financial aid administrators to target the root causes
    of improper payments at the schools. For example, FSA has and will continue to
    publish guidance and respond to questions regarding verification requirements
    to help clarify verification requirements and reduce the risk of verification
    deficiencies. For additional information, see also the agency responses to the
    various questions in this FY 2024 year-end payment integrity data call on the
    types of corrective actions planned (i.e., Behavioral/Psych Influence, Training,
    Change Process, Cross-Enterprise Sharing, Audit, and Predictive Analytics).


    FSA has and will continue to maintain a robust internal control framework, which
    includes conducting annual program risk assessments and reviews of program participants,
    among other activities. FSA has and will continue to leverage Single Audit Act
    compliance audits of its loan and grant programs as a key source of identifying
    risks and potential improper payments made by external entities, including federal,
    state, and private organizations and institutions, that receive and further distribute
    grant and loan funds to subordinate organizations and individuals. FSA will continue

  rap5: 'The Direct Loan program has achieved its tolerable rate. FSA has the internal
    controls, human capital, and information systems and other infrastructure needed
    to continue to maintain IP and UP estimates within the tolerable rate band.


    FSA must also continue to rely on controls established by external entities that
    receive funds and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including Direct
    Loans. These entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will continue
    to leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance audits to
    identify and address root causes of IPs and UPs made by external entities.

  rap6: The most recent budget provides $2.7 billion for Student Aid Administration,
    including to the Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA),
    a $625 million increase over the fiscal year 2024 annualized continuing resolution
    (CR) level. This additional funding is essential to support students and student
    loan borrowers. The increase would allow FSA to continue to operate the student
    aid programs, implement critical improvements to student loan servicing, continue
    to modernize its digital infrastructure, and provide for the administration of
    the financial aid programs through a simplified and streamlined application process
    for students and borrowers.
  rnp3: "Preventing IPs is a top Administration and agency priority. To effectively\
    \ prevent IPs and UPs from occurring, FSA evaluates the root causes of IPs and\
    \ UPs identified. This root cause analysis is used to help formulate effective\
    \ correction actions and prioritize efforts to prevent IPs and UPs from occurring.\
    \ For example, FSA's most impactful root cause over the last five years for total\
    \ IP in aggregate across all programs has been improper payments due to misreported\
    \ income. FSA has invested significant resources and worked cross-agency with\
    \ the IRS to implement the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal\
    \ tax information data directly from the IRS. Significant work has been accomplished,\
    \ and once fully implemented in FY 2025, this corrective action is expected to\
    \ significantly reduce misreported income on the FAFSA.\n\nFSA relies on the expertise\
    \ of its subject matter experts and owners of the corrective actions to identify\
    \ any changes for its corrective actions. FSA monitors the status of the corrective\
    \ actions through quarterly outreach to corrective action owners and collects\
    \ closure evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and progress of each individual\
    \ mitigation strategy. This process informs whether the corrective action can\
    \ be refined, intensified, expanded, or should be discontinued or replaced. \n"
  rnp4: 'Key management officials have annual performance appraisal elements that
    contain specific criteria related to payment integrity.


    FSA managers and staff are held accountable for maintaining effective controls.
    FSA performs an annual assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls,
    including those controls designed to prevent or detect improper payments. Any
    deficiencies identified are remediated and retested within the next assessment
    cycle.


    FSA has an integrated system of complementary oversight functions to help prevent,
    detect, and recover improper payments, and ensure compliance by all participating
    parties. This includes routinely conducting program reviews to confirm that schools
    meet requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and
    administrative capability. Program reviews evaluate schools’ compliance with federal
    requirements, assess monetary liabilities for errors in performance which are
    calculated based on program review findings, and identify actions schools must
    take to make whole the Higher Education Act’s Title IV programs or recipients
    for any funds that were improperly managed and prevent the same problems from
    recurring. FSA also uses Single Audit Act compliance audits as a key source of
    identifying risks and potential improper payments made by schools. FSA has worked
    with fund recipients to resolve audit findings timely.
