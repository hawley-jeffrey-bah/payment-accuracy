    mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced by
    its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Due to Pension reporting
    over $100 million of overpayments/loss in FY2020, the program was required by
    Office of Management and Budget to report quarterly on activities and accomplishments
    that reduce monetary loss. Those activities and accomplishments can be found at
    PaymentAccuracy.gov. Pension has remained committed to actions that reduce monetary
    loss and continues to tailor corrective actions to reduce improper payments.

  cyp20_2: The Pension reduction target is equal to the estimated future improper
    payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by setting
    them lower than the current year improper payment estimates.  Reduction targets
    are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has learned
    from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments legislation
    is that it can take three years from the point an error cause is isolated during
    testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then wait for payments
    to be made that can then be tested the following year since VA tests and reports
    improper payments one year in arrears.

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within agency control occur when claims processors fail to
      use available beneficiary information to correctly process beneficiary awards.
      In some instances, beneficiary information may not be current, however, claims
      processors can use the available information as a basis for calculating correct
      benefit amounts or deferring actions or decisions until additional information
      is received from the beneficiary.  The program has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments through the use of reviews to ensure proper policies and procedures
      are applied in the adjudication of claims and taking corrective action when
      errors resulting in improper payments are identified.

  pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments.  Although
    the Pension program experienced an overall increase in improper payments from
    FY 2021 to FY 2022, the program made significant headway in implementing a mitigation
    strategy process designed to decrease improper payments in the highest overall
    error category, failure to access data/information. Starting in September 2022,
    a large batch of claims is sent weekly to claims processors for review and corrective
    action. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies, the program expects the impact of this action on FY 2023 payments
    with anticipated compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019
    for FY 2024.
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate.  VA is working to determine
    all requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and
    Budget guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time,
    VA is not aware of additional program needs.

    VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the corrective action
    plans implemented in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness
    of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
    implemented and prioritized within the agency.  The results of the Pension program
    indicated that of the seven actions assessed, four were closed and determined
    to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to be
    ineffective in mitigating the root cause, and two were designed ineffectively
    to mitigate the root cause.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information and inability to access
    data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
    to a total reduction in improper payment amount from $410.52m in FY 2020 to $378.87m
    in FY 2021, or a 7% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether
    proper or improper, associated corrective actions contributed to a total reduction
    in the unknown payment amount from $4.64m in FY 2020 to $2.63m in FY 2021, or
    a 43% reduction.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

- Actions_Taken:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include conducting
      quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances
      between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus
      the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential
      overpayments, so correcting the differences ensures VA is making correct payments
      and prevents future improper payments. In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable
      to failure to access data/information prior to issuing payment. To address the
      root cause, VA will use the existing match between Social Security Administration
      income data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to
      identify variances which are indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with
      variances are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve
      discrepancies, identify and establish debts for overpayments if applicable,
      and prevent future overpayments. In addition, VA uses the Social Security Administrations
      Death Master File to match against active beneficiaries and their dependents,
      which allows VA to stop payment timely for deceased beneficiaries. These ongoing
      Social Security Administration matches identify potentially deceased beneficiaries
      still receiving benefits for VA to stop benefits and prevent overpayments. These
      actions are designed to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure
      to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve accuracy and accessibility
      of data to validate beneficiary income and eligibility status prior to payment.

      In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable to failure to access data/information
      prior to issuing payment. Due to administrative errors, corrective action includes
      conducting Special Focus Reviews to ensure claims processors apply proper policies
      and procedures in making accurate decisions. Additional audit actions include
      taking corrective actions when improper payments are identified such as proper
      adjudication of claims or collection of overpayments if applicable. These actions
      are designed to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure to access
      data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Audit was the best

  pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although VA pension
    remains non-compliant, the impact of the program changes is reflected in a decrease
    in the improper and unknown payment rate from 11.66% in FY 2022 to 10.86% (for
    a 0.80% reduction) and a $73.16 million decrease in improper payments in FY 2023.
    Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
    the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on its FY 2024
    improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
  rnp3: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. In FY 2023, VA
    performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2022.
    The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Pension program indicated
    that of the four actions assessed, one was closed and determined to be effective
    in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to be correctly designed
    to mitigate the root cause, and two were open and determined that improvements
    could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be
    made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies
    to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. For errors tied to failure
    to access data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies
    contributed to a reduction in the improper payment amount from $472.99 million
    in FY 2022 to $362.34 million in FY 2023, or a 23% reduction. VA will perform
    an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action plans developed and
    implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions
    as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported

      corrective action included conducting focused reviews to ensure claims processors
      properly applied policies and procedures in making accurate pension rate decisions.
      These actions were taken to reduce future improper payment errors associated
      with failure to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts
      and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper

    Mitigation_Strategy: atp6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included conducting quarterly matches
      with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social
      Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts
      reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a
      beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their pension benefit.
      Validating whether a change is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents
      future improper payments. To address the root cause, VA automated the process
      of implementing a match between Social Security Administration income data and
      VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enabled VA to identify variances
      which were indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with variances were
      prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve discrepancies,
      adjust benefits if appropriate, and prevent future overpayments. In addition,
      VA used the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to match against
      active beneficiaries or their dependents, which allowed VA to stop payment timely
      for deceased beneficiaries. These ongoing Social Security Administration matches
      identified potential deceased beneficiaries or their dependents still receiving
      benefits for VA to stop benefits and prevent future overpayments. These actions
      were taken to reduce future improper payment errors associated with failure
      to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts and unknown
      payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Automation was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve accuracy and
      accessibility of data to validate beneficiary income and eligibility status
      prior to payment.

      Validating whether a change is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents
      future improper payments. To address the root cause, VA will use the existing
      match between Social Security Administration income data and VA income data
      for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to identify variances which are indicators
      of potential overpayments. Claims with variances are prioritized and sent to
      claims processors in batches to resolve discrepancies, adjust benefits if appropriate,
      and prevent future overpayments. These actions are designed to reduce future
      improper payment errors associated with failure to access data/information needed

  act17_1: 'VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown payments and developed
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The causes of FY 2024 overpayments
    and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, and the
    cause of unknown payments was attributed to unable to determine whether proper
    or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments occurred due to beneficiaries
    not timely reporting changes in Social Security income to VA which then requires
    VA to identify discrepancies and work with beneficiaries to determine if adjusting
    benefits is appropriate. The majority of underpayments were due to human errors.
    The majority of unknown payments occurred because beneficiaries did not timely
    report changes in Social Security income to VA requiring due process before VA
    can make a final determination. If a sampled benefit payment is identified as
    a potential overpayment and has yet to enter due process or is currently in due
    process, a determination of whether it is proper or improper cannot be made.


    Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted from
    beneficiaries not timely providing information to VA, so VA identified the Social
    Security Administration as an alternative data source and implemented a quarterly
    Social Security income match. This match enables VA to identify variances between
    Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts
    reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary’s
    income, which could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether
    a change is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents future improper payments.
    The Social Security income match occurs quarterly and regulations require a 60-day
    due process period. The due process period protects the beneficiary from reduction
    adjustments being made to their pension payments without validation of the data
    VA has received from a third party. Therefore, VA must continue to make the pension
    payment and does not know if the payment is accurate or not until due process
    is complete. Audit was the best mitigation strategy in order to identify systemic
    discrepancies and reinforce adherence to policies and procedures to improve accurate
    pension rate decisions prior to payment. Training was the best mitigation strategy
    in order to improve awareness and increase skills to improve accurate pension
    rate decisions prior to payment.'
  act17_2: Although the overall error rate for this program increased from 10.86%
    in FY 2023 to 13.85% in FY 2024 (for a 2.99% increase), the program underwent
    improvements in FY 2024 that will improve its ability to reduce improper and unknown
    payments in the future. This included updating testing procedures to correctly
    differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments, obtaining more details during
    payment integrity testing to improve development of effective corrective actions,
    and improving corrective action and mitigation strategies planned for FY 2025. Additionally,
    the Cost-of-Living Adjustment error category was changed to within agency control
    and recategorized under Social Security Administration Income as the root cause
    to improve transparency related to VA’s access to SSA income data. This change
    reduced the Cost-of-Living Adjustment errors to zero in FY 2024. Dependency, incarceration,
    and death of beneficiary errors were reduced to zero in FY 2024 and focused reviews
    found no systemic causes for these errors. Claims processors were informed of
    these prior year errors and subsequently adjudicated the claims properly. VA's
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies have been evaluated by the Office
    of Inspector General during their FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable
    with no recommendations for improvement. The overpayments and underpayments were
    attributed to VA's failure to access data/information and unknown payments were
    attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Actions taken
    and planned regarding automation include conducting quarterly matches with the
    Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social Security Administration
    income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary
    to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary's income, which
    could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether a change is
    needed and making changes if necessary, prevents future improper payments. Actions
    taken and planned regarding audit include randomly reviewing claims processors’
    work to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate
    pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. Actions planned regarding
    training include training staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly
    applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments.
  act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and
    no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions are appropriately
    prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments. VA
    monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly basis. Additionally,
    an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure if an action reduced
    or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments for a specific
    root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness review process allows
    VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued progress in the
    remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas for improvement are identified,
    VA conducts a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies
    to ensure they addressed and reduced root cause(s) of error. The increase in the
    Pension program's improper payment and unknown payment rate from 10.86% in FY
    2023 to 13.85% in FY 2024, and the $99.31 million increase in improper and unknown
    payments supports the effectiveness review determination that improvements are
    needed to at least two of the program's corrective actions in place in FY 2024.
    As part of the established corrective action process, the program reported improved
    corrective action and mitigation strategies planned for FY 2025.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Pension reduction target is equal to the estimated future improper
    payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by setting
    them lower than the current year improper and unknown payment estimates. Reduction
    targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has
    learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments
    legislation is that it can take three to five years from the point an error cause
    is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then
    wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following year since
    VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: If a benefit payment is identified as a potential overpayment due to
    a beneficiary failing to inform VA of changes that impact the payment rate, VA
    must provide a 60-day due process period that protects a beneficiary’s rights
    to provide additional financial documentation which could potentially change or
    even eliminate a match to third party data indicating there was a change in income.
    Until due process is complete, VA cannot make a final determination and the payment
    must be classified as unknown. Payments must also continue unchanged until the
    60-day due process period concludes.
  cyp8: If a benefit payment is identified as a potential overpayment and has yet
    to enter due process or is currently in due process, a determination of whether
    it is proper or improper cannot be made. VA must provide a 60-day due process
    period that protects a beneficiary’s rights to provide additional financial documentation

    cyp2_1: 'VA overpayments are within the agency’s control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to correctly process beneficiary
      awards. These overpayments occurred for multiple reasons; however, the two main
      reasons are: (1) that beneficiaries failed to notify VA of changes and (2) human
      error. Claims processors can manually access Social Security Administration
      income information to calculate correct benefit amounts when a beneficiary notifies
      VA of a change. VA is improving administrative compliance by using the Social
      Security Administration income match; however, when a potential variance is
      identified, VA must continue to make the current benefit payment while determining
      whether the change in benefit is valid which results in potential overpayments.
      The program is also working with claims processing stations on the human errors
      identified each fiscal year. These improvements will result in increased payment
      accuracy.'

  pro1: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although
    the Pension program remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall improper
    and unknown payments, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will
    improve its ability to reduce improper payments in the future. This included updating
    testing procedures to correctly differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments,
    increasing detail obtained during testing to improve development of effective
    corrective actions, and improving corrective action and mitigation strategies
    planned for FY 2025.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
    Office acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
    using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. In FY 2024, VA performed
    an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose
    of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions or mitigation
    strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized
    within the agency. The results for the Pension program indicated that of the three
    actions assessed, one was open and determined to be designed effectively to mitigate
    the root cause, and two were open and determined that improvements could be made
    to effectively mitigate the root cause. VA conducted a root cause analysis to
    refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root
    cause(s) of error and added training to corrective actions planned for FY 2025.
    Additionally, VA obtained more details during payment integrity testing this year
    for the program to improve development of effective corrective actions. VA will
    perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action plans developed
    and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions
    as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported
    in FY 2025.
  rnp4: 'The Pension program was determined noncompliant with PIIA for FY 2023 by
    the OIG in May 2024. Additionally, the program is reporting improper and unknown
    payments above the required thresholds in FY 2024 for a compliance determination
    by the OIG in May 2025. In FY 2025, the Executive Director for Pension and Fiduciary
    Service will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as audit, automation, and
    training. These actions will help bring the program into compliance by reducing
    errors associated with failure to access data/information and unknown payments
    attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. The Executive
    Director for Pension and Fiduciary Service’s performance plan includes performance
    metrics appropriate to ensure mission is met while still ensuring payment integrity.


    Generally, VA Senior Executives are held accountable via the performance appraisal
    process as established by VA’s Corporate Senior Executive Management Office. This
    process includes oversight from VA’s Performance Review Board, which evaluates
    each executive’s performance appraisal, the executive’s response to the initial
    summary rating, if any, and the results of any higher-level official’s findings
    and recommendations. Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned with
    each Senior Executive’s overall level of performance.'
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper and
    unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively within
    existing budget authority.

Description: 'The Pension program helps wartime Veterans and their survivors cope
  with financial challenges by providing supplemental income to recipients who meet
  the annual income and net worth limits set by law. A change in benefit payment occurs
  when a required adjustment is made due to a status change (e.g., change in income,
  net worth, medical expenses, dependency, etc.); which caused a projected $381.78
  million in monetary loss in FY 2024. A known barrier is relying on beneficiaries
  to notify the VA when they experience life or financial changes since these factors
  may impact continued eligibility. When applicable, the VA pursues debt collection
  by offsetting benefit payments for the full amount of the debt or by approved repayment
  installments. '
