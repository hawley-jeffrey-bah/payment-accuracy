    always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  We
    directly leverage our existing internal control environment and assurance processes
    to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments
    are in place and operating effectively.


    As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
    management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
    Act.


    We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
    membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
    clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


    Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on
    having the necessary trained staff to do the work.   For the most part, our employees
    who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and
    other mission-critical work.


    Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
    to serve the public and safeguard our programs.


    We initiated our IT Modernization Plan in fiscal year (FY) 2018 to improve our
    service to the public.  We will advance our IT infrastructure with 21st century
    technology and implement the technical flexibility necessary to adapt to future
    demands.  In FY 2020, we increased the scope to include building online services,
    improving and expanding automated services available through our National 800
    Number, and providing additional self-service and express services in our field
    offices.  To achieve our modernization goals, we are investing $863 million over
    5 years, including the $415 million that Congress provided in dedicated IT modernization
    funding in FYs 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.


    Other Infrastructure:  We emphasize the importance of information security through
    continual operational refinement and the maturation of security components that
    exceed the standards set forth by Government regulations.  In FY 2021, we continued
    to align our agency cybersecurity priorities with agency strategic objectives
    and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework
    (CSF) to identify, detect, and stop fraudulent transactions before they occur.  Continued
    alignment with the CSF will infuse practices from Federal initiatives including
    the President’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan, the Department of Homeland
    Security’s (DHS) High Value Asset program, and DHS’s Continuous Diagnostics and
    Mitigation program.  We will continue to streamline and modernize the existing
    Comprehensive Integrity Review Program business process.  The revised process
    will use innovative technologies such as big data and predictive analytic tools
    to identify, detect, and stop fraudulent programmatic transactions before they
    occur.

    We continue to identify and measure the root causes of improper payments.  We
    are documenting corrective actions in multiple Improper Payment Alignment Strategies
    (IPAS).  We are developing a framework to establish measurements and benchmarks
    to evaluate the completed corrective actions within the IPASs.  We will continue
    to look for innovative ways to glean information to measure the effectiveness
    of existing corrective actions, where feasible.  It is a challenging process to

    with a focus on digital modernization and efforts that enable technology to provide
    tangible benefits to our customers.


    Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
    information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
    to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
    controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
    and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
    a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous
    improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive
    Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and
    Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
    Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes
    to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents
    Act.


    Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
    network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
    cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
    partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
    flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.'
  rap6: The fiscal year 2023 President’s Budget included resources for internal controls
    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested funding for program
    integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use, such as our medical Continuing
    Disability Reviews, Supplemental Security Income redeterminations, and the Cooperative
    Disability Investigations program, save billions of program dollars with a proportionally
    small investment of administrative resources.

  rtp4_2: In October 2021, the Office of Management and Budget published the Tolerable
    Improper Payment Rate guide.  We have been in discussions regarding the tolerable
    rate for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program while referencing the
    Tolerable Improper Payment Rate guide.  Therefore, our response is subject to
    change regarding achieving tolerable rate.  We strive to reduce improper payments
    within the constraints of statutory and regulatory requirements and available
    resources.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement
    for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally
    make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many
    factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid,
    subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either
    an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes
    cause improper payments.   While we strive to improve our efforts to reduce improper
    payments, outcomes must be significant to affect our error rate.  To have an effect
    on improper payments, for fiscal year 2021 each tenth of a percentage point in
    payment accuracy represented about $56.2 million in SSI program payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Our Agency Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022-2026
      established the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper
      payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access
      the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed,
      we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We
      are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:


      Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February
      2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food
      assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition
      of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.


      Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October
      2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment
      of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of
      the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need
      their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental
      Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.


      Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM
      published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception
      in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM
      if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In
      April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified
      SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the
      SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the
      existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten
      the application process for SSI disability applicants.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023 there were several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct
      software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.

      2020, SSI applications decreased by 30 percent when compared to prior years.  We
      analyzed a range of beneficiary characteristics to determine if any groups were
      disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We identified a population
      of 1.4 million individuals who are currently receiving OASDI benefits that are
      less than the SSI federal benefit rate.  Based on these findings, we mailed
      approximately 200,000 letters to beneficiaries potentially eligible for SSI,
      with a focus on the aged and limited English proficiency populations.  The preliminary
      mailing occurred December 2020–March 2021.  We released the remaining 1.2 million

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed and failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed Access to Financial Institutions (AFI).  The purpose of
      AFI is to identify excess resources in financial accounts, which are a leading
      cause of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program
      uses an electronic process with participating financial institutions to verify
      bank account balances and detect undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks.  We
      will be evaluating the benefit to running AFI between the SSI initial application
      and subsequent eligibility redeterminations, based on an Office of the Inspector
      General recommendation.  In March 2023, we released Policy in Focus training
      and issued a frontline broadcast to remind technicians of AFI and SSI financial
      accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account
      Verification Reminders and issued a frontline broadcast to ensure that technicians
      are reviewing the financial account pages in the SSI claims path for accuracy
      before adjudicating an event.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private
      sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand
      our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States
      Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the
      expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  For FY
      2023 we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These
      data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child''s foster placement
      has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding
      this exchange.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a
      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical
      State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and
      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist
      and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change
      of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the United States
      Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
      program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an
      address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically
      posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion
      to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  Based on NCOA data analysis,
      we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility
      of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating the notices to inform SSI
      recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding
      their living situation.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist,
      inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data
      or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages,
      we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an information exchange
      with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan
      Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We
      have completed several phases of pre-implementation development and are drafting
      a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations for the PIE process.  We
      will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after the final rule (regulation)
      is established.  We will perform ongoing assessments while working towards full
      implementation.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Our Agency Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022-2026
      established the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper
      payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access
      the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed,
      we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We
      are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:


      Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February
      2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food
      assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition
      of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.


      Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October
      2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment
      of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of
      the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need
      their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental
      Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.


      Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM
      published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception
      in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM
      if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In
      April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified
      SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the
      SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the
      existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten
      the application process for SSI disability applicants.

      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023 there were several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct
      software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information

      barriers to accessing our programs and assist individuals interested in filing
      for Supplemental Security Income and other potential benefits.  The online protective
      filing tool is a public-facing web tool to submit a request for an appointment
      to file for benefits and record a protective filing date.  The tool prevents
      underpayments by making it easier for applicants to file for benefits.  In March
      2023, we began releasing mailers targeted to households within underserved zip
      codes.  The mailers were sent weekly through September 2023 in batches of about
      100,000 in both English and Spanish.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we developed the SSA Mobile Wage Reporting App.  Supplemental Security
      Income recipients, deemors, and representative payees may use the SSA Mobile
      Wage Reporting App (downloaded at no cost from Google Play and Apple App) to
      report wages and ensure payment accuracy.  We enhanced the application to offer
      a more secure method of authentication for application users.  We implemented
      multi-factor authentication in September 2023.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)

      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information

    cyp4_1: 'Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayments outside the agency’s
      control occur when the data or information needed does not exist and because
      of our inability to access data or information needed.  For the root cause data
      or information needed does not exist, overpayments occur because there is no
      database or dataset that currently exists where we can check eligibility prior
      to making the payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s
      income, which includes support and maintenance provided in kind.  This type
      of income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month
      as household expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may
      change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source we can use to verify
      these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses,
      composition, and contributions accurately and timely.


      For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients
      (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes
      in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or
      a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of
      both overpayments and underpayments.  Although we explicitly inform all individuals
      of their reporting requirements during the application process and within every
      award letter, pamphlets periodically sent to recipients, and standard language
      in most official agency correspondence, recipients and representative payees
      may fail to report or may not report changes in time to prevent an improper
      payment.


      SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources
      who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated
      by the statutory requirement to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI
      payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month
      for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even
      if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect
      the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus,
      the program requirements themselves sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  We
      remain committed to simplifying the SSI program, and we are exploring ways to
      do this in an equitable manner.

      '
  pro1: We paid over $57 billion in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Federal and
    State supplementary payments throughout fiscal year 2022.  The total SSI improper
    payment amount was approximately $5.3 billion.  Of that total, $4.3 billion was
    attributed to overpayments outside of the agency’s control.  The SSI program has
    been our greatest improper payment challenge because of the inherent nature of
    the program.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement
    for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally
    make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month,
    and many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct
    when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting
    in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements themselves
    sometimes cause improper payments.  We strive to reduce SSI improper payments
    within the constraints of statutory and regulatory requirements and available
    resources.
  rap5: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that has
    always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
    existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
    assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating
    effectively.


    As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
    management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
    Act.


    We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
    membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
    clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


    Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on
    having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our employees
    who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and
    other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is critical to maintain
    a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship work.


    Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
    to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
    investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
    digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and mobile
    accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital services
    that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers to service
    to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and employees.  We
    are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service while reducing
    manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient funding is necessary
    to continue to modernize our IT.


    Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
    information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
    to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
    controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
    and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
    a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous
    improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive
    Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and
    Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
    Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes
    to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents
    Act.


    Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
    network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
    cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
    partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
    flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.


    '
  rap6: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget included resources for internal controls
    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested funding for program
    integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use, such as our medical Continuing
    Disability Reviews, Supplemental Security Income redeterminations, and the Cooperative
    Disability Investigations program, save billions of program dollars with a proportionally
    small investment of administrative resources.
  rnp3: 'We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure
    stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor
    the status of corrective actions through monthly meetings and quarterly senior
    executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive
    approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target
    the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to
    prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The
    purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that
    will have the most significant impact on the detection and prevention of improper
    payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments,
    we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally
    responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.


    In fiscal year 2023, we completed evaluations on three of our Improper Payments
    Alignment Strategies.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore cost-effective
    corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we continue to note
    that the complexity of our Supplemental Security Income program makes it extremely
    difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular corrective
    action.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year 2023, there were several CCE
      updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct software
      problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In December 2023, CCE Announcements
      became available.  Now, when updates are made within CCE, the technicians receive
      a brief message the first time they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks
      will be provided for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This
      enhancement is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time
      information within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related
      to CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including
      the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the
      User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing
      and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page with
      redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements,
      we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation,
      which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism
      to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error and
      reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating
      the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional application.  We
      also plan to release our first retirement benefit application within CCE.  We
      will test it in a few field offices before a national release.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  In February 2024, TED was rolled out
      nationally to all field offices and workload support units.  In March 2024,
      an additional task called External Tasks became available.  External Tasks provides
      technicians the ability to open commonly used applications directly from TED.  As
      of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications available via TED.  We
      plan to continue to enhance the customer composite by bringing in and displaying
      more customer information from other systems.  Releases to enhance existing
      functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We are also working on plans to expand
      to other user groups, such as field and regional offices, including Appellate
      Operations.  Integration of the technician facing portion of the Visitor Intake
      Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production.  In September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded the eSignature/Upload Documents
      service to all field offices and workload support units nationwide.  This release
      allows customers to access the service with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also,
      in March 2024, eSignature/Upload Documents became available to all Field Offices
      and Workload Support Units Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months,
      we began releasing mobile friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms
      for customer completion.  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated
      10-day follow up reminder and confirmation of successful submission emails to
      enhance communication with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated
      the service with my Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text
      communications.  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms
      for a mobile friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and
      evidence types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social
      Security and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including
      the Upload Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand
      to 3rd party forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional
      support to our mutual customers.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we inform Supplemental Security Income
      (SSI) recipients and representative payees about their reporting responsibilities
      through various methods:  during interviews, with application and redetermination
      forms, in some award and post-eligibility notices, in check envelope enclosures,
      and in a booklet that accompanies award notices.  Our annual Cost of Living
      Adjustment notices include reminders about reporting changes that could affect
      payments and eligibility.  In September 2013, we implemented an automated SSI
      wage reporting reminder for individuals who sign up to receive a monthly email
      or text message to report wages for the prior month.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos including information about the importance of creating a my
      Social Security account; how to submit wages using myWR, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting,
      or SSI Telephone Wage Reporting; who can report; and reminders on reporting
      responsibilities.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we published social
      media posts on Facebook and X sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries
      learn why it is important to report wages and the automated electronic options
      for wage reporting.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates
      reminding them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring
      we have current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that
      explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The
      blog provides examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving
      a Better Life Experience accounts.  In July 2024, we published a blog about
      the agency’s commitment to improve timely delivery of payments to SSI recipients
      and our progress addressing underpayments.  In August 2024, we published a blog
      that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting life changes to
      Social Security.  The blog provides examples of life changes that need to be
      reported to avoid overpayments, how to report these changes, and where to obtain
      more information.  In July and August of 2024, we used our social media channels
      to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly reporting
      changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate
      benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media channels to
      post reminders for our recipients about the importance of promptly reporting
      changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate
      payments and avoid overpayments.  These posts also inform recipients how we
      are required by law to adjust payments or recover debts when people receive
      payments they are not entitled to.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of
      our notices and communications can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The
      difficulty can sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal
      requirements to communicate certain information.  We updated a blog for “Social
      Security Matters” that focuses on the importance of Supplemental Security Income
      recipients reporting their financial accounts and any changes related to financial
      accounts to us.  In an effort to increase responsiveness of beneficiaries and
      recipients in self-reporting information that impacts payments, we used behavioral
      insights methods to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the blog.  Also,
      we are currently updating the Work Activity Report (SSA-821) to make it more
      understandable and more likely to be completed by applicants.  In addition,
      throughout 2024 we reviewed new and revised agency notices for both clear messaging
      and plain language.  We will need to obtain Office of Management and Budget
      clearance for Form SSA-821 prior to implementation.  We will sample notices
      and other communications and assess the quality and understandability of our
      communications.  We will continue to inform and remind recipients about reporting
      responsibilities.  We will also continue to review overpayment-related notice
      review requests (both new and revised language) to make sure it is in plain
      language that people can read and understand.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we released updated guidance.  In June 2022, and
      subsequently in April 2023 and August 2023, we released updated guidance on
      special processing instructions for applying Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
      and resource exclusions to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  In March 2023,
      and subsequently in April 2023, we released updated pandemic related assistance
      that meets the criteria for the disaster assistance exclusion chart.  In April
      2023, we released reminders to ensure that SSI underpayment reviews are documented
      and completed in accordance with policy.  In August 2023, we provided post-pandemic
      transitional instructions for applying income and continued resource exclusions
      to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  The transitional instructions are
      still in place in 2024 until permanent policy instructions are published.  For
      recipients who incurred overpayments during COVID-19, we issued internal guidance
      for technicians reminding them how to adjudicate waiver requests.  We are drafting
      permanent policy instructions to replace the transitional instructions for applying
      income and continued resource exclusions to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  We
      plan to publish the permanent policy instructions in the second quarter of fiscal
      year 2025.

      period
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access data or information needed, we developed the online protective filing
      tool.  The online protective filing tool is a public-facing web tool to submit
      a request for an appointment to file for benefits and record a protective filing
      date.  The tool prevents underpayments by making it easier for applicants to
      file for benefits.  In March 2024, we changed policy and procedures to streamline
      the recording of protective filing dates.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist,
      inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data
      or information needed, we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance
      (ISM) is calculated.  We are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify
      ISM policies.  Beginning September 30, 2024, we are no longer counting food
      as income when we figure Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, so that
      food assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  This new rule removes a critical barrier for SSI eligibility due
      to informal food assistance from friends, family, and community networks of
      support.  Also beginning September 30, 2024, the agency expanded its SSI rental
      subsidy policy which due to judicial decision was only in place for SSI applicants
      and recipients residing in certain States.  We now expanded the rental subsidy
      policy for all SSI applicants and recipients which may increase the payment
      amount and allows more people to qualify for critical SSI payments.  Lastly,
      beginning September 30, 2024, we expanded the definition of a public assistance
      household to include households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
      Program payments and households where at least one household member other than
      the recipient or applicant receives public assistance.  The expanded definition
      allows more people to qualify for SSI, increases some SSI recipients’ payment
      amounts, and reduces reporting burdens for individuals living in public assistance
      households.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to reduce the complexity of our SSI application.  In
      August 2023, the agency reconvened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the SSI application process in a three-phased
      approach:  Phase I – Focuses on an expansion of the current internet claim (iClaim)
      with added SSI questions; Phase II – Focuses on technician supported modalities,
      which will  encompass adult, aged, child, married, and third-party applications
      through the service delivery channels of in-person, telephone, and forms; and
      Phase III – This will establish an online, mobile-first, and public-facing system
      for the SSI and Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance programs and other
      applications, replicating the telephone, in-person, and paper service delivery
      channels.  Human-centered design testing will be employed to shape the mobile-first
      solution.  We completed the following in fiscal year 2024:  completed development
      of the expansion of the SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI process;
      posted to the Federal Register Notice (FRN) and obtained feedback from the public;
      reviewed the FRN comments and incorporated the feedback into our new three-phased
      approach; and reviewed the plan for the new approach with advocates/representatives
      and secured a decision to proceed from the Commissioner.  We plan to implement,
      in late 2024, the expansion of iSSI for SSI disability applicants.  The iSSI
      Release will expand iClaim and introduce as few as 12 user-tested, SSI-specific
      questions across 6 screens, shaping the simplified SSI application to be launched
      in late 2024.  We also plan to complete the following:  remove iClaim exclusions
      to allow online processing of approximately 5000 additional claims; finalize
      training and marketing materials; and complete final testing and prepare for
      a production release of the expanded iSSI.'

      solution.  We completed the following in fiscal year 2024:  completed development
      of the expansion of the SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI process;
      posted to the Federal Register Notice (FRN) and obtained feedback from the public;
      reviewed the FRN comments and incorporated the feedback into our new three-phased
      approach; and reviewed the plan for the new approach with advocates/representatives
      and secured a decision to proceed from the Commissioner.  We plan to implement,
      in late 2024, the expansion of iSSI for SSI disability applicants.  The iSSI
      Release will expand iClaim and introduce as few as 12 user-tested, SSI-specific
      questions across 6 screens, shaping the simplified SSI application to be launched
      in late 2024.  We also plan to complete the following:  remove iClaim exclusions
      to allow online processing of approximately 5000 additional claims; finalize
      training and marketing materials; and complete final testing and prepare for
      a production release of the expanded iSSI.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we looked for Old-Age, Survivors, and
      Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for
      higher Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  We
      developed a “Potential Entitlements” Tactical Plan to educate people who may
      be eligible for Social Security benefits, particularly Survivors’ benefits and
      SSI.  It also includes targeted outreach by providing materials to third parties
      and our regional communications staffs.  We also conducted a longitudinal study
      on mailers in fiscal year (FY) 2024.  The draft is currently in the review/clearance
      process.  Communications tactics from our Tactical Plan will continue through
      calendar year 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed and failure to access data or information needed, we conduct non-medical
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) redeterminations (RZ).  A non-medical SSI
      RZ is a complete review of a recipient’s or couple’s non-medical eligibility
      factors (resources, income, and living arrangements) to determine whether the
      recipient or couple has remained eligible since the time of the previous decision,
      is still eligible for SSI, and has been receiving and will continue to receive
      the correct SSI payment amount.  To ensure the most cost-effective investment
      of agency resources, we use a predictive model to estimate the likelihood and
      magnitude of overpayments to select cases for discretionary RZs.  Other cases
      are selected for RZs outside our modeling process based on selected case characteristics,
      such as manual deeming of income.  The RZ process also selects limited issue
      (LI) reviews, which are reviews of a specific issue or event related to a recipient’s
      or couple’s non-medical eligibility factors to determine whether the recipient
      or couple is still eligible for and receiving the correct SSI payment.  In December
      2023, we issued guidance on achieving FY 2024 RZ and LI workload goals, with
      reminders to field offices about best practices and following the order of priority
      when scheduling RZs and LIs.  In FY 2024, we completed more than 2.5 million
      SSI non-medical RZs and LIs.  We plan to process about 2.5 million SSI RZs and
      LIs in FY 2025.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we inform Supplemental Security Income
      (SSI) recipients and representative payees about their reporting responsibilities
      through various methods:  during interviews, with application and redetermination
      forms, in some award and post-eligibility notices, in check envelope enclosures,
      and in a booklet that accompanies award notices.  Our annual Cost of Living
      Adjustment notices include reminders about reporting changes that could affect
      payments and eligibility.  In September 2013, we implemented an automated SSI
      wage reporting reminder for individuals who sign up to receive a monthly email
      or text message to report wages for the prior month.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos including information about the importance of creating a my
      Social Security account; how to submit wages using myWR, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting,
      or SSI Telephone Wage Reporting; who can report; and reminders on reporting
      responsibilities.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we published social
      media posts on Facebook and X sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries
      learn why it is important to report wages and the automated electronic options
      for wage reporting.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates
      reminding them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring
      we have current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that
      explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The
      blog provides examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving
      a Better Life Experience accounts.  In July 2024, we published a blog about
      the agency’s commitment to improve timely delivery of payments to SSI recipients
      and our progress addressing underpayments.  In August 2024, we published a blog
      that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting life changes to
      Social Security.  The blog provides examples of life changes that need to be
      reported to avoid overpayments, how to report these changes, and where to obtain
      more information.  In July and August of 2024, we used our social media channels
      to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly reporting
      changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate
      benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media channels to
      post reminders for our recipients about the importance of promptly reporting
      changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure accurate
      payments and avoid overpayments.  These posts also inform recipients how we
      are required by law to adjust payments or recover debts when people receive
      payments they are not entitled to.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of
      our notices and communications can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The
      difficulty can sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal
      requirements to communicate certain information.  We updated a blog for “Social
      Security Matters” that focuses on the importance of Supplemental Security Income
      recipients reporting their financial accounts and any changes related to financial
      accounts to us.  In an effort to increase responsiveness of beneficiaries and
      recipients in self-reporting information that impacts payments, we used behavioral
      insights methods to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the blog.  Also,
      we are currently updating the Work Activity Report (SSA-821) to make it more
      understandable and more likely to be completed by applicants.  In addition,
      throughout 2024 we reviewed new and revised agency notices for both clear messaging
      and plain language.  We will need to obtain Office of Management and Budget
      clearance for Form SSA-821 prior to implementation.  We will sample notices
      and other communications and assess the quality and understandability of our
      communications.  We will continue to inform and remind recipients about reporting
      responsibilities.  We will also continue to review overpayment-related notice
      review requests (both new and revised language) to make sure it is in plain
      language that people can read and understand.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we released updated guidance.  In June 2022, and
      subsequently in April 2023 and August 2023, we released updated guidance on
      special processing instructions for applying Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
      and resource exclusions to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  In March 2023,
      and subsequently in April 2023, we released updated pandemic related assistance
      that meets the criteria for the disaster assistance exclusion chart.  In April
      2023, we released reminders to ensure that SSI underpayment reviews are documented
      and completed in accordance with policy.  In August 2023, we provided post-pandemic
      transitional instructions for applying income and continued resource exclusions
      to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  The transitional instructions are
      still in place in 2024 until permanent policy instructions are published.  For
      recipients who incurred overpayments during COVID-19, we issued internal guidance
      for technicians reminding them how to adjudicate waiver requests.  We are drafting
      permanent policy instructions to replace the transitional instructions for applying
      income and continued resource exclusions to pandemic-related disaster assistance.  We
      plan to publish the permanent policy instructions in the second quarter of fiscal
      year 2025.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, there were several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct
      software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In December 2023, CCE
      Announcements became available.  Now, when updates are made within CCE, the
      technicians receive a brief message the first time they access the application
      describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided for the user to access
      more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement is designed to assist
      our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information within CCE, so they
      do not have to pause and locate references related to CCE.  In June 2024, we
      released enhancements to several CCE pages including the Special Enrollment
      Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the User Experience Framework.  We
      also released an enhancement to the Printing and Signature page that replaces
      the existing Printing and Signatures page with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document
      Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements, we are working on a multi-phased
      implementation for SSI payment continuation, which will automate the current
      legacy process to a modernized input mechanism to initiate and remove payment
      continuation.  This will reduce user error and reliance on the regionally developed
      appeals application.  We are incorporating the start date functionality within
      CCE, which is housed within a regional application.  We also plan to release
      our first retirement benefit application within CCE.  We will test it in a few
      field offices before a national release.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we developed the SSA Mobile Wage Reporting App.  Supplemental Security
      Income recipients, deemors, and representative payees may use the SSA Mobile
      Wage Reporting App (downloaded at no cost from Google Play and Apple App) to
      report wages and ensure payment accuracy.  We implemented multi-factor authentication
      in September 2023.  In FY 2024, we continued backend technical enhancements
      to the application to offer a more secure method of authentication for application
      users.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In FY 2023, TED added
      Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general
      improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became available for use
      in the Boston region.  In February 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all
      field offices and workload support units.  In March 2024, an additional task
      called External Tasks became available.  External Tasks provides technicians
      the ability to open commonly used applications directly from TED.  As of June
      2024, there are a total of 24 external applications available via TED.  We plan
      to continue to enhance the customer composite by bringing in and displaying
      more customer information from other systems.  Releases to enhance existing
      functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We are also working on plans to expand
      to other user groups, such as field and regional offices, including Appellate
      Operations.  Integration of the technician facing portion of the Visitor Intake
      Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production.  In September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded the eSignature/Upload Documents
      service to all field offices and workload support units nationwide.  This release
      allows customers to access the service with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also,
      in March 2024, eSignature/Upload Documents became available to all Field Offices
      and Workload Support Units Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months,
      we began releasing mobile friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms
      for customer completion.  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated
      10-day follow up reminder and confirmation of successful submission emails to
      enhance communication with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated
      the service with my Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text
      communications.  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms
      for a mobile friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and
      evidence types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social
      Security and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including
      the Upload Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand
      to 3rd party forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional
      support to our mutual customers.'

      AFI is to identify resources in financial accounts; excess resources are a leading
      cause of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program
      uses an electronic process with participating financial institutions to verify
      bank account balances and detect undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks
      based on the residential address.  In March 2023, we released Policy in Focus
      training and issued a frontline broadcast to remind technicians of AFI and SSI
      financial accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial
      Account Verification Reminders and issued a frontline broadcast to ensure that
      technicians are reviewing the financial account pages in the SSI claims path
      for accuracy before adjudicating an event.  We began analysis on optimizing
      the use of AFI.  We expect to conclude our study on optimal frequency for use
      of AFI and related recommendations in fiscal year 2025.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private
      sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand
      our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice (DXCOP) and
      the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and
      broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of
      data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming data exchanges
      with State foster care agencies.  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an
      Information Exchange Agreement and are participating, and 10 states signed the
      Information Exchange Agreement of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges
      assist in avoiding improper payments when a child''s foster placement has changed.  We
      continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In
      June and September 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State
      agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our
      outreach efforts with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest,

      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed and failure to access data or information needed, we are improving our
      death data processing.  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we
      can administer our programs.  We have a contract with every State Bureau of
      Vital Statistics (the custodians for death records) and with some jurisdictions
      to provide us death data.  Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are
      able to build a streamlined death registration process known as Electronic Death
      Registration (EDR). As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through
      the EDR process.  We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death
      inputs, improving the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical
      death records in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports,
      we issued a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System
      for reports of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness
      of our death information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the
      National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on
      the acquisition of historical State death records.  This effort will increase
      the accuracy, integrity, and completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist
      and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change
      of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the U.S. Postal
      Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
      program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an
      address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically
      posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion
      to the SSI program.  Based on NCOA data analysis, we are updating the existing
      NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility of expansion to the
      SSI program.  We are updating a notice to add a reminder informing concurrent
      OASDI and SSI recipients to contact us because we may need additional information
      regarding their living situation.  The notice will have clarified language to
      concurrent OASDI and SSI recipients informing them to contact us to report living
      arrangement changes that may have occurred with the address change received
      through the NCOA process.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the
      reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools,
      such as an automated information exchange with commercial payroll data providers
      authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred
      to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In February 2024, we published
      a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing the agency’s plans for accessing
      and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments
      (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The
      public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering
      the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication
      in winter of FY 2025.  In fiscal year 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage
      reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when
      incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn''t automatically post
      to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement
      PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased approach.  This timeline will ensure
      compliance with rulemaking requirements and allow us to respond to public concerns
      from the NPRM public comment period.'

      wage and employment information from PIE doesn''t automatically post to the
      SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in
      the Spring of 2025 through a phased approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance
      with rulemaking requirements and allow us to respond to public concerns from
      the NPRM public comment period.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by data or information
      needed does not exist, inability to access the data or information needed, and
      failure to access data or information needed, we developed a logic model framework
      to measure the effectiveness of completed corrective actions that includes establishing
      benchmarks to evaluate the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible,
      and determining whether additional mitigation activities are necessary.  We
      monitor the progress of corrective actions for financial accounts, wages, in-kind
      support and maintenance, death, absence from the United States, and non-home
      real property (NHRP), which are the leading causes of Supplemental Security
      Income improper payments.  In fiscal year (FY) 2022, we completed the evaluation
      for wages and NHRP.  In FY 2023, we completed the evaluation of medical continuing
      disability review cessations and improving death data processing.  In FY 2024,
      we completed the evaluation of completed actions on financial accounts and in-kind
      support and maintenance.

    Completion_Date: The corrective action was not fully completed this reporting
      period
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we looked for Old-Age, Survivors, and
      Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for
      higher Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  We
      developed a “Potential Entitlements” Tactical Plan to educate people who may
      be eligible for Social Security benefits, particularly Survivors’ benefits and
      SSI.  It also includes targeted outreach by providing materials to third parties
      and our regional communications staffs.  We also conducted a longitudinal study
      on mailers in fiscal year (FY) 2024.  The draft is currently in the review/clearance
      process.  Communications tactics from our Tactical Plan will continue through
      calendar year 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed and failure to access data or information needed, we conduct non-medical
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) redeterminations (RZ).  A non-medical SSI
      RZ is a complete review of a recipient’s or couple’s non-medical eligibility
      factors (resources, income, and living arrangements) to determine whether the
      recipient or couple has remained eligible since the time of the previous decision,
      is still eligible for SSI, and has been receiving and will continue to receive
      the correct SSI payment amount.  To ensure the most cost-effective investment
      of agency resources, we use a predictive model to estimate the likelihood and
      magnitude of overpayments to select cases for discretionary RZs.  Other cases
      are selected for RZs outside our modeling process based on selected case characteristics,
      such as manual deeming of income.  The RZ process also selects limited issue
      (LI) reviews, which are reviews of a specific issue or event related to a recipient’s
      or couple’s non-medical eligibility factors to determine whether the recipient
      or couple is still eligible for and receiving the correct SSI payment.  In December
      2023, we issued guidance on achieving FY 2024 RZ and LI workload goals, with
      reminders to field offices about best practices and following the order of priority
      when scheduling RZs and LIs.  In FY 2024, we completed more than 2.5 million
      SSI non-medical RZs and LIs.  We plan to process about 2.5 million SSI RZs and
      LIs in FY 2025.'

  act17_1: 'To focus our efforts, we have a team dedicated to monitoring and measuring
    the effectiveness of the progress of improper payment mitigation strategies and
    corrective actions.  We have the Improper Payments Alignment Strategy where we
    conduct root cause analysis of improper payments and obtain agency-wide engagement
    and agreement of actions needed to remedy improper payment issues.  This approach
    helps us develop corrective actions and mitigation strategies that are focused
    on the root cause of improper payments.


    We completed quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work, such as
    conducting Supplemental Security Income (SSI) non-medical redeterminations, to
    ensure individuals receive the payments for which they are eligible.


    For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure
    to access data, our corrective actions and strategies fall within several high-level
    categories such as automation, business process improvement (including program
    and policy simplification), and training to improve accuracy.  We also evaluated
    the completed corrective actions to determine whether changes in the outcome could
    be attributed to the implementation of the corrective actions.  We compared data
    before and after the implementation of corrective actions to determine whether
    we need additional actions.


    We are investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees
    with user-friendly systems and tools to better serve the public, including a single
    unified process for benefit applications and a consolidated source with all information
    and agency interactions with our customers.  To meet the challenges of our growing
    workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies
    and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business
    processes.  We will enhance the quality of training to better equip our workforce.


    An Agency Priority Goal for fiscal years (FY) 2024 and 2025 is to improve equity
    in the SSI program.  We will increase our underpayment processing of our oldest
    and highest priority cases.  By September 30, 2025, we plan to complete 98 percent
    of SSI underpayments that have been identified as priority cases or pending for
    a year or more at the beginning of FY 2024.


    The root causes of overpayments outside agency control are data or information
    needed does not exist and inability to access data or information needed.  We
    are addressing these root causes, by establishing alternate sources of information
    to administer the SSI program.  For example, we conducted 22 computer-matching
    agreements with various Federal partners to obtain benefit payment data, wage
    data, unemployment data, fugitive felon identification data, workers’ information,
    residency information, nursing facility admission data, and other data to help
    us determine eligibility and offset benefits for our programs.  The total annual
    savings attributed to these computer-matching agreements is approximately $11
    billion, with an annual cost of approximately $377 million, yielding a positive
    benefit-to-cost ratio of about $29 to $1.


    To reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing an automated
    information exchange with commercial payroll data providers as a strategy to reduce
    improper payments.  By FY 2025, we plan to begin utilizing the Payroll Information
    Exchange (PIE) to improve efficiency in processing wage reports for the SSI and
    Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance programs.  PIE allows us to receive
    wage and employment information electronically from payroll data providers on
    a monthly basis for individuals who have given authorization and whose employers
    participate with the payroll data providers.  Additionally, we are promoting timely
    wage reporting and issuing reminders on reporting responsibilities.


    We understand that reminders will not solve all problems related to improper payments
    caused by root cause factors outside the agency’s control.  However, we will influence
    change where possible by simplifying communications and the way information is
    presented as our approach to reduce cognitive burden and improve understanding
    and readability.


    We will continue our quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work
    including medical disability reviews and SSI non-medical redeterminations.


    For improper payments within the agency’s control, we will continue to invest
    in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly
    systems and tools to better service the public.  To meet the challenges of our
    growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we will streamline our
    policies and procedures and automate more of our business processes.  We will
    continue to issue periodic reminders and policy clarifications, as needed.


    For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we will continue to influence
    change where possible by utilizing behavioral insight.  We will continue to promote
    timely reporting and reminders on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to continue
    current computer-matching agreements (CMA) that yield a positive cost-benefit
    ratio, expand effective CMAs to meet additional program needs, research current
    programs, work with internal stakeholders to identify data exchange needs, and
    pursue new data exchanges with potential partners.

    '
  act17_2: "The primary cause of improper payments outside of agency control data\
    \ or information needed does not exist is because there is no database or dataset\
    \ that currently exists where we can validate eligibility prior to making the\
    \ payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s income,\
    \ which includes support and maintenance provided in-kind.  This type of income\
    \ is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month as household\
    \ expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may change.  Additionally,\
    \ there is no database or data source we can use to verify these factors.  We\
    \ rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses, composition, and\
    \ contributions accurately and timely.  However, as of September 30, 2024, we\
    \ made three updates as part of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) regulation\
    \ simplification:\n\nOmitting food from in-kind support and maintenance (ISM)\
    \ calculations - The rule removes a critical barrier for SSI eligibility due to\
    \ an applicant’s or recipient’s receipt of informal food assistance from friends,\
    \ family, and community networks of support.  The new policy further helps in\
    \ several important ways:  the change is easier to understand and use by applicants,\
    \ recipients, and agency employees; applicants and recipients have less information\
    \ to report about food assistance received from family and friends, removing a\
    \ significant source of burden; the reduced month-to-month variability in payment\
    \ amounts will improve payment accuracy; and the agency will see administrative\
    \ savings because less time will be spent administering food ISM.\n\nExpanding\
    \ the rental subsidy - This expands the SSI rental subsidy policy, which due to\
    \ judicial decisions is currently only in place for SSI applicants and recipients\
    \ residing in seven States (Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Texas, Vermont,\
    \ and Wisconsin).  Under the rule, rental assistance, such as renting at a discounted\
    \ rate, is less likely to affect a person’s SSI eligibility or payment amount.\
    \  This new rule extends the same advantageous policy to all SSI applicants and\
    \ recipients nationwide.  This may increase the benefit amount some people are\
    \ eligible to receive and will allow more people to qualify for critical SSI payments.\n\
    \nExpanding the definition of a public assistance household - This expands the\
    \ definition of a public assistance household to include households receiving\
    \ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments and households where not\
    \ all members receive public assistance.  The expanded definition will allow more\
    \ people to qualify for SSI, increase some SSI recipients’ payment amounts, and\
    \ reduce reporting burdens for individuals living in public assistance households.\n\
    \nThe primary cause of improper payments within the agency’s control is our failure\
    \ to take timely and proper action.  The primary cause of improper payments outside\
    \ the agency’s control is recipients’ or representatives’ failure to report changes.\
    \  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments, we channel\
    \ our efforts in the most efficient manner so that the corrective actions taken\
    \ are adequate.  \n"
  act17_3: 'The actions taken were effectively implemented and prioritized within
    the agency.  Over the past several years, we have made strides in establishing
    a framework to obtain agency-wide engagement and agreement on actions needed.  Through
    the Improper Payments Alignment Strategy (IPAS), we determine the most cost-effective
    strategies to remediate the underlying cause of improper payments, and we monitor,
    measure, and revise strategies, as needed.  We take into consideration the cost
    and savings that will result from implementation of the corrective action plan.


    In addition to monitoring and evaluating the initiatives, we have developed a
    comprehensive approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives
    that target the root causes of improper payments.  Combined, these efforts serve
    to prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  This
    approach strategically aligns agency-wide initiatives that will have the most
    significant impact to the detection and prevention of improper payments.  Through
    the IPAS process and the prioritization of planned reduction initiatives, we effectively
    implemented corrective actions that have the most impact for preventing and reducing
    improper payments.


    We have centralized the coordination and monitoring of agency-wide improper payment
    initiatives.  We implemented the IPAS to focus on our corrective actions to address
    the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  As part of our IPAS,
    we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of each completed corrective
    action or mitigation strategy.  Additionally, we will determine the most cost-effective
    strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and revise the
    strategies, as needed.


    We will focus on efforts to address the root causes of improper payments.  For
    improper payments within the agency’s control, we will pursue workflow adjustments,
    policy and notice changes, training and reminders for technicians, and automation
    solutions to improve accuracy.  For improper payments outside the agency’s control,
    we will continue to influence change where possible.

    cyp4_1: 'Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayments outside the agency’s
      control occur when the data or information needed does not exist or because
      of our inability to access data or information needed.  For the root cause data
      or information needed does not exist, overpayments occur because there is no
      database or dataset that currently exists where we can check eligibility prior
      to making the payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s
      income, which includes support and maintenance provided in kind.  This type
      of income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month
      as household expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may
      change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source we can use to verify
      these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses,
      composition, and contributions accurately and timely.  However, as of September
      30, 2024, we are no longer counting food as income when we figure SSI payments
      and we have expanded the rental subsidy policy.  Additionally, we have expanded
      the definition of a public assistance household to include households receiving
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments and households where at least
      one household member other than the recipient or applicant receives public assistance.  These
      three updates are part of SSI regulation simplification.


      For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients
      (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes
      in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or
      a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of
      both overpayments and underpayments.  Although we explicitly inform all individuals
      of their reporting requirements during the application process and within every
      award letter, pamphlets periodically sent to recipients, and standard language
      in most official agency correspondence, recipients and representative payees
      may fail to report or may not report changes in time to prevent an improper
      payment.


      SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources
      who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated
      by the statutory requirement to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI
      payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month
      for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even
      if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect
      the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus,
      the program requirements themselves sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  We
      remain committed to simplifying the SSI program, and we are exploring ways to
      do this in an equitable manner.'
  pro1: We paid over $61 billion in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Federal and
    State supplementary payments throughout fiscal year 2023.  The total SSI improper
    payment amount was approximately $6.5 billion.  Of that total, approximately $5.3
    billion was attributed to overpayments outside of the agency’s control.  The SSI
    program has been our greatest improper payment challenge because of the inherent
    nature of the program.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory
    requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We
    generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that
    month, and many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was
    correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due,
    resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements
    themselves sometimes cause improper payments.  We strive to reduce SSI improper
    payments within the constraints of statutory and regulatory requirements and available
    resources.
  rap5: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that has
    always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
    existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
    assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating
    effectively.


    As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
    management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
    Act.


    We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
    membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
    clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


    Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on
    having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our employees
    who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and
    other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is critical to maintain
    a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship work.


    Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
    to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
    investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
    digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and mobile
    accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital services
    that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers to service
    to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and employees.  We
    are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service while reducing
    manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient funding is necessary
    to continue to modernize our IT.


    Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
    information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
    to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
    controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
    and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
    a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous
    improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive
    Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and
    Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
    Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes
    to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents
    Act.


    Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
    network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
    cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
    partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure

    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested $1.903 billion
    in dedicated funding for program integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use,
    such as our medical Continuing Disability Reviews, Supplemental Security Income
    redeterminations, and the Cooperative Disability Investigations program, save
    billions of program dollars with a proportionally small investment of administrative
    resources.
  rnp3: 'For the root cause data or information needed does not exist, overpayments
    occur because there is no database or dataset that currently exists where we can
    check eligibility prior to making the payment.  For example, the law requires
    us to evaluate an individual’s income, which includes support and maintenance
    provided in kind.  This type of income is difficult to accurately value because
    it can fluctuate each month as household expenses, composition, and the type of
    assistance provided may change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source
    we can use to verify these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in
    household expenses, composition, and contributions accurately and timely.  However,
    as of September 30, 2024, we are no longer counting food as income when we figure
    Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, and we expanded the rental subsidy
    policy which may increase the amount some people are eligible to receive.  Additionally,
    we expanded the definition of a public assistance household to include households
    receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments and households where
    at least one household member other than the recipient or applicant receives public
    assistance.  These three updates are part of SSI regulation simplification.


    For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients
    (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes
    in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a
    change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both
    overpayments and underpayments.


    For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure
    to access data, our corrective actions and strategies fall within several high-level
    categories such as automation, business process improvement (including program
    and policy simplification), and training to improve accuracy.


    We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure stewardship
    and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor the status
    of corrective actions through bi-monthly meetings and quarterly senior executive
    meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive approach
    to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target the
    root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to prioritize
    and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The purpose
    of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that will have
    the most significant impact on the detection and prevention of improper payments.  By
    identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments, we channel
    our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally responsible
    as we implement a corrective action plan.


    In fiscal year (FY) 2024, we completed evaluations on two of our Improper Payments
    Alignment Strategies.  Additionally, in FY 2024, we completed our annual updates
    that are part of monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of completed corrective
    actions on the leading causes in improper payments.  We will continue to find
    opportunities to explore cost-effective corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However,
    we continue to note that the complexity of our SSI program makes it extremely
    difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular corrective
    action.

  rnp4: "We are committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensuring\
    \ the public has confidence that we manage their tax dollars wisely.  We demonstrate\
    \ a commitment to sound management practices.  To ensure stewardship and the efficient\
    \ administration of our programs, we have established performance measures in\
    \ our Annual Performance Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2023–2024 to track our progress.\
    \  Under Strategic Objective 3.1 – Improve the Accuracy and Administration of\
    \ our Programs, there are two performance measures directly related to reduction\
    \ of improper payments:  \n\n3.1a - Improve the integrity of the Supplemental\
    \ Security Income program by focusing our efforts on reducing overpayments.  \n\
    \n3.1b - Maintain a high payment accuracy rate by reducing overpayments, in the\
    \ Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program.\n\nUnder our annual\
    \ Performance Accountability and Communication System, all agency managers have\
    \ a critical element called “Manages Performance.”  This element includes two\
    \ performance standards related to preventing and reducing improper payments:\
    \  establishes and maintains suitable internal controls to prevent improper payments;\
    \ and uses established guidelines to reduce and recover improper payments.\n\n\
    We assess managers throughout the agency on these standards each year and hold\
    \ them accountable for meeting improper payment reduction targets.  Each agency\
    \ component adds expectations that are more detailed for their positions describing\
    \ what is expected for meeting these performance standards.\n\nSenior Executive\
    \ performance plans must clearly align with organizational goals and objectives\
    \ under the Results Driven Critical Element.  Performance levels in the performance\
    \ requirements must reflect agency targets.\n\nWe established the Improper Payments\
    \ Oversight Board (IPOB), consisting of senior executive membership, to ensure\
    \ that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating clear and innovative\
    \ strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.  The Deputy Commissioner\
    \ of the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight (OARO) serves as the executive\
    \ chair for the IPOB.  To further our focus on reducing improper payments, in\
    \ FY 2019, we established an Improper Payments Prevention Team now referred to\
    \ as the Improper Payments Prevention Branch, in OARO.  The team works with key\
    \ agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS)\
    \ that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate the root causes\
    \ of improper payments.  As part of our IPAS, we will evaluate the effectiveness\
    \ of each planned or ongoing mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we will determine\
    \ the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment\
    \ errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies, as needed.  IPOB is\
    \ responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all improper payment\
    \ initiatives.\n\nWe have a strong internal control environment that has always\
    \ included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  We\
    \ directly leverage our existing internal control environment and assurance processes\
    \ to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls over improper payments\
    \ are in place and operating effectively.  \n\nAs part of our internal control\
    \ environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management control program\
    \ as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.  \n\nThe effective\
    \ internal controls we incorporate into our business processes and financial management\
    \ systems, as well as the program integrity efforts, support our Commissioner’s\
    \ annual assurance statement to the President and Congress.\n\nIn April 2019,\
    \ we established the Enterprise Fraud Risk Management (EFRM) program to systematically\
    \ assess fraud risks across our major programmatic and administrative areas. \
    \ Through our EFRM program we have conducted multiple fraud risk assessments on\
    \ key areas such as Disability, Electronic Services, Administrative Services,\
    \ and the Representative Payee program.  After each fraud risk assessment, our\
    \ senior executives review each fraud risk and determine whether our controls\
    \ are effective or whether we need to develop additional controls to further reduce\
    \ the risk.  For each risk designated as “reduce” by our executives, we develop\
    \ additional mitigation strategies to further prevent or detect the fraud.  The\
    \ risk response and the designated mitigation strategies form the basis of the\
    \ fraud risk profile for each fraud area.\n\nWe completed a maintenance fraud\
    \ risk assessment of the Agency’s Administrative Services during FY 2024 and continued\
    \ the reassessment of the disability fraud risk profile, consistent with the Government\
    \ Accountability Office guidance, to reassess fraud risk profiles on a three-year\
    \ cycle.  We also finalized the Fraud Risk Profiles for the Enumeration program\
    \ at the end of calendar year 2023.\n\nFor recovery of overpayments, when negotiating\
    \ a rate of overpayment recovery, we attempted to recover within 36 months before\
    \ requiring income and expense documentation.  In February 2024, we changed our\
    \ policy to extend this timeframe to 60 months and reduced the burden on our beneficiaries\
    \ to provide additional financial and resource information.\n"

Description: The SSI program provides financial support to aged, blind, and disabled
  adults and children with limited income and resources.  Our greatest payment accuracy
  challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI payment amounts can fluctuate monthly
  with changes in non-medical factors of eligibility like resources, income, and living
  arrangements.  Beneficiariesâ€™ failure to report, or timely report, these changes
  are the primary cause of improper payments.  For example, unless the beneficiary
  self-reports wage data and financial accounts monthly, we verify them retroactively,
  which leads to an improper payment.  Another cause of improper payments is our failure
  to timely update our records with reported changes.
