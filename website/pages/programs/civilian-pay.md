Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) is cold fusion
      application. It has been increasingly difficult for the DoDEA programmers to
      make changes to the system as the digital code which they are written in does
      not conform to current DoD new technology requirements such as a CAC-enabled
      signature. The DoDEA is undergoing system modernization. Once this system is
      updated and modernized accordingly, this will effectively address the technically
      improper payments. Similarly for the Army, once the directive from CHRA is fully
      implemented to ensure that SF1190s are signed according to policy, technically
      improper payments will be addressed. Both of these corrective actions are directly
      targeting the root cause of improper payments.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'Army Civilian Field Offices were unable to provide
      complete SF 1190s with authorizing signatures. Addressing the root causes for
      the samples determined Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that
      combined is above the statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan
      (CAP) is a combination of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions
      aimed at reducing the likelihood of Technically Improper or Unknown Payment
      errors occurring during the payment process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army
      Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian
      pay personnel offices to ensure that block 25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation
      of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army
      Command partners. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly
      coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue
      to review the requirements that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting
      existing SF 1190s), and will coordinate with our Command partners appropriately.


      An additional Department CAP has been created specifically for Department of
      Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard
      Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  Completion
      of the SF-1190 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount
      for all overseas allowances.  During the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 audit, the SF-1190
      was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found that the SF-1190 did not have
      consistent signatures and dates on the standard forms. DoDEA is in the process
      of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System
      (DAPS) which is to be housed on their internal ServiceNow network. With the
      upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled signatures and dates.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'DoDEA is in the process of completing a system modernization
      of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be housed on our
      internal ServiceNow network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability
      for CAC-enabled signatures and dates. Once the system modernization is implemented
      and operational, DoDEA will conduct an internal audit of Fiscal Year  2024 Quarter
      2 and Quarter 3 SF1190s to ensure that the modernization CAC enabled signatures
      and dates are operating effectively.


      For the Army Per the CHRA Leadership, effective immediately, the CHRA team will
      ensure that block 25 on SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA
      and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by the Army Command partners.
      Any 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated with
      Commands to ensure forms are correct.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Military Branch primarily responsible for the corrective
      actions conducted in Fiscal Year 2023 was the U.S. Army due to the majority
      of the technically improper payments being attributed to  unsigned SF 1190s
      to substantiate overseas entitlements such as Living Quarters Allowance. The
      U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA) provided a directive for all
      civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that block 25 of SF 1190s requesting
      reconciliation of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block 26 on All SF 1190 forms
      are signed by their Command partners. Any SF 1190s that are currently being
      processed will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms
      are correct.  CHRA will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and
      coordinate with Command partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The FY 2023 Corrective Action Plan for the Civilian
      Pay Program was developed to address the technically improper payments due to
      the lack of or inability to provide adequate key supporting documentation for
      disbursements from samples selected during post pay review of the program.  The
      error reason for the majority of the civilian payments was that the SF 1190s
      did not have an authorizing signature.

      Human Capital:

      The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in
      the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  However,
      as the Civilian Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill
      sets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs
      to reduce improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department
      has targeted.  The primary system currently used by the Department to process
      Civilian Pay is the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS).  The general and application
      controls of DCPS were included in the scope of the Federal Civilian Pay Services
      FY 2021 Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 examination,
      which received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type
      2 report.  Additionally, the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System, which provides
      employment verification information, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report
      under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2021.  Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the
      Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are
      the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified SOC
      1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2021.  As technology advances, the Department
      continues to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian Pay through implementation
      of new payroll and entitlement processing systems and enhancements to existing
      systems.

    rap6: The Department's Civilian Pay program did not submit any specific budgetary
      requests to bring the program into PIIA compliance that the Office of the Under
      Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team is aware.
    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD OIG concluded that the previous Department
      estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable
      which led to insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions
      (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department
      has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
      for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans,
      created a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
      of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
      Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been
      approved by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample
      sizes by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula
      and process will produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the
      Department’s efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance
      during the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has
      DoD OIG confirmed reliable estimates; the Department will be able to establish
      effective and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

      to become audit compliant with information technology regulations as well as
      audit policies and procedures related to the review and approval of SF1190s.
      DoDEA has multiple audits each year and a Resource Management (RM) Financial
      Analysis Branch (FAB) and Strategic and Excellence (SOE) Risk Management Internal
      Control (RMIC) Program which reviews internal controls to ensure DoDEA's compliance
      with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.

      \ which is then uploaded into the application. The system is not able to provide\

      \ signature. There were samples that did not have signatures on the Standard\
      \ Form (SF) 1190s in DAPS due to the transition from DoDEA’s Human Resource\
      \ service providers. DoDEA changed from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to\
      \ the Army Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA). During the service provider\
      \ transition, the signature cards were exchanged between DLA and CHRA which\

    cyp7_ucp4_1: "The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) employees utilize\

      \ requirements. These include Permanent Change of Station (PCS for First Duty\
      \ Station, Between Duty Station, and Separation travel), and Renewal Agreement\
      \ Travel (RAT), and Education Travel (for employee dependents) orders. Once\
      \ the travel order has been requested in the TOPS, it is routed to the DoDEA\
      \ Personnel Center who will process it. When processing has been completed,\
      \ the employee is notified via email that he/she can retrieve the TOPS travel\
      \ order on the Online web site and view/print their completed Travel Order.\
      \ At that point, employees use those orders to begin reservations for airfare,\
      \ and household good shipments, automobile shipments, if applicable.  \n\nA\

      \ request and see when their order has been processed and completed by the assigned\
      \ Human Resource office.  \n\nTOPS and DAPS are cold fusion applications. It\
      \ has been increasingly difficult for the DoDEA programmers to make changes\
      \ to these systems as the digital code which they are written in does not conform\
      \ to current DoD changes nor new technology requirements such as a CAC enabled\
      \ signature. The DoDEA is undergoing system modernization for both systems."
    cyp8: During the PIIA Compliance audit work for the Department's Civilian Pay
      Payment Integrity program, the Department Components were unable to provide
      the appropriate Key Supporting Documentation in order to determine if the sample
      was proper or improper. Additionally, Department of Defense Education Activity
      (DoDEA) high-level problems that caused the samples to be marked unknown was
      due to DoDEA’s overseas entitlements. Many of DoDEA’s educators relocate periodically
      to DoDEA schools all over the world resulting in a change in documentation.
      The locality code may be a factor in determining the valid pay code for the
      locality where they are based. The SF1190s that were submitted during testing
      as supporting documentation were not accepted due to the incorrect signatures.
