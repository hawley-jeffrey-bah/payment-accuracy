    Completion_Date: FY2023
    Description_Action_Taken: TRSUI calculates the provider distribution amounts based
      upon the minutes submitted and the current rate in the database. Calculations
      are randomly checked by signers when reviewing distribution documents. TRS will
      continue to rely on the system calculations unless errors arise.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q3
    Description_Action_Taken: A discussion took place with the process owner of the
      TRS Provider Distribution process in September 2023. The process owner was instructed
      to update all TRS signers who approve payments when any file intervention must
      take place. It is rare for manual overrides to be made on the payment files
      but in the situation where it must be done, they must notify the signers of
      what manual overrides had to be performed as well as the impact of those overrides
      to ensure signers recalculate any calculations a 2nd and 3rd time.

    Description_Action_Taken: Provider Distribution Process documentation was updated
      for the item discussed in ATP3_1. Future internal control audits and PIIA reporting
      will include this as a note for any manual calculations being performed.

  rap5: The error found was a result of manual intervention which is rare in the regular
    course business. TRS has adequate systems, human capital and internal controls
    over this process. The changes implemented will help to open communication for
    further questions and analysis if manual intervention is needed in the future.
  rap6: No resources were requested in the most recent budget submission of the agency
    to establish and maintain the current internal controls.
  rnp3: The actions taken were aimed at making the Distribution signers responsible
    for approving payment aware when manual intervention takes place. Manual intervention
    is typically needed roughly once a year therefore automation is relied upon the
    majority of the time. Due to the limited times that this happens as well as the
    severity of the finding, no further automation or action is needed at this time.
