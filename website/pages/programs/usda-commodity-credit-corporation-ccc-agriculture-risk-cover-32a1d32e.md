  rap5: "Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to\

    \ processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only\
    \ make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation\
    \ at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\nFarm Service Agency will\
    \ require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal\
    \ controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting\
    \ more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   \n\
    \nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve\
    \ the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity\
    \ and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional\
    \ compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive\
    \ and robust compliance program.  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions\
    \ whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related\
    \ issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer,\
    \ but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency\
    \ to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability\
    \ and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
    \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal\
    \ controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are\
    \ still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity\
    \ to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
    \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating\
    \ the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency\
    \ program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues\
    \ to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering\
    \ Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers\
    \ duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties.\
    \ Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing\
    \ a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal\
    \ year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.\n\nInformation\
    \ Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive\
    \ measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to\
    \ reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance;\
    \ therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal\
    \ controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance\
    \ of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning\
    \ to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software\
    \ to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster\
    \ programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative\
    \ entries and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software\
    \ “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the\
    \ increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current\
    \ deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems.\
    \ \n\nFrom an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has\
    \ invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues\
    \ to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
    \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
    \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
    \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
    \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned\
    \ through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s\
    \ new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions\
    \ to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to:\
    \ 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical,\
    \ survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling”\
    \ and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are\
    \ delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a\
    \ risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified\
    \ to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics\
    \ that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating\
    \ a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators,\
    \ anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment\
    \ of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation\
    \ of authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
    \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and\
    \ determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm\
    \ Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling\
    \ of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval\
    \ and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and\
    \ the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency,\
    \ data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant\
    \ investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations\
    \ have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase\
    \ transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to\
    \ support important mission-focused decision-making.  \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm\
    \ Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program\
    \ 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity\
    \ Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss\
    \ Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio,\
    \ Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.\
    \  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity,\
    \ and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial\
    \ staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.\n \n"

    establish accountability measures for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and for
    fiscal year 2023. Throughout the fiscal year, National, State, and County program
    managers will continue to evaluate areas where policy needs revising or to be
    clarified, and additional training is necessary.

    Description_Action_Taken: The root cause category for these findings is statutory
      requirements of program not met. The Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss
      Coverage program is currently part of Farm Service Agency’s Internal Control
      roadmap to improve program processes.  1. Currently in development is an improper
      payment trend analysis tool that has Fiscal Year 2019-2023 improper payment
      data.  The tool will identify staff, county offices and states with continued
      improper payment findings.  The tool will allow the agency to target county
      offices and staff for targeted training along with holding employees accountable,
      if warranted after training has been provided.  2.  Standardize Training policy
      for Farm Programs is part of the internal control roadmap for Fiscal Year 2025.  Training
      guidance would provide standardization for Headquarters, State and County level
      training.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'The root cause of Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price
      Loss Coverage’s findings was failure to access data and specifically related
      to acreage reporting errors. The Safety Net Division addressed this by:


      1) Late filed acreage reporting policy was provided on October 18, 2023, during
      an Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage bi-weekly call with State
      office Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage specialists. The training
      was recorded and is available on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Agriculture
      Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage SharePoint page, 2) An acreage reporting

  act17_1: To address these findings Safety Net Division established an acreage reporting
    task force consisting of State and county office specialists to discuss issues,
    findings, and suggest solutions relating to acreage reporting. The outcome was
    2-CP amendment 28 issued on April 12, 2024.  Payment limitation, payment eligibility
    and conservation compliance training were developed and provided at National Training
    during the week of July 15, 2024.These corrective actions are focused on the cause
    of the improper payments.
  act17_2: The ability to scale the corrective action in the current year is difficult
    since the time frames of the Payment Integrity Information Act review and corrective
    action plans are significantly delayed versus the Agriculture Risk Coverage and
    Price Loss Coverage program cycle. The Payment Integrity Information Act cycle
    reviews program payment made in the prior year.  Agriculture Risk Coverage and
    Price Loss Coverage payments from the prior year are based of contract and eligibility
    documents from two years prior to that payment.   Therefore, corrective actions
    taken during current year will not be recognized in Payment Integrity Information
    Act results for another three years. These corrective actions are adequate to
    address the cause of the improper payments.
  act17_3: Actions taken to reduce Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage
    improper payment percentages have been effectively implemented and prioritized
    by including the root cause corrections in National Training. By providing training
    to all states, it is allowing a broader reach in information as it is provided
    locally to county offices.  All training was recorded and is made available for
    all employees to access at all times. The ability to scale the corrective action
    is difficult since the time frames of the Payment Integrity Information Act review
    and corrective action plans are significantly delayed versus the Agriculture Risk
    Coverage and Price Loss Coverage program cycle. The Payment Integrity Information
    Act cycle reviews program payment made in the prior year.  Agriculture Risk Coverage
    and Price Loss Coverage payments from the prior year are based of contract and
    eligibility documents from two years prior to that payment. Therefore, corrective
    actions taken during current year will not be recognized in Payment Integrity
    Information Act results for another three years. These corrective actions will
    be effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency to reduce improper
    payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: With the implementation of the current corrective actions and the planned
    corrective actions for the program, it is the agency’s anticipation that the projected
    reduction target will be less than the estimated future improper payment rate.

    requirements for payment limitation and eligibility, acreage reporting, and conservation
    compliance. 1) Updates had been made to payment eligibility documents and new
    determinations were not made, forms were not completed correctly, and software
    was not updated accordingly, 2) Acreage reporting requirements were not followed
    properly and loaded into the software incorrectly, 3) Forms were not completed
    correctly and subsequently software was not updated appropriately.


    Statute requires Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage payments are
    made based on these three areas being correct.

  rap5: A tolerable rate for Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage has
    not been established. However, in order to reduce Agriculture Risk Coverage and
    Price Loss Coverage’s improper payments, system enhancements and training for
    staff is required although Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget
    is not adequately funded to implement the requested enhancements.  Farm Service
    Agency will request funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation

  rnp3: Incorrect acreage reporting, payment limitation and eligibility, and conservation
    compliance have been perennial findings for Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price
    Loss Coverage. While training has assisted in addressing these findings, automation
    enhancements are needed to assure errors are prevented.  In the meantime, specific
    national training has been given as recently as July 15 – 19, 2024. All trainings
    are recorded and posted on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s training SharePoint
    page.  Further, Safety Net Division holds bi-weekly calls with State Office Agriculture
    Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage specialists to discuss findings, provide
    training, and answer questions. All calls are recorded and posted on Deputy Agriculture
    for Farm Program’s Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage SharePoint
    page. These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate Agriculture Risk Coverage
    and Price Loss Coverage’s improper payment dollars of $35.35 million related to
    statutory requirements not met.

  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage
    Program is to have an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this
    may not represent the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions
    taken by the agency have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent
    threshold.
