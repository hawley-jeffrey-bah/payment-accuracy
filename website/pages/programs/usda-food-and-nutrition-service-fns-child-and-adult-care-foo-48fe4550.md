  pro1: 'The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
    Tiering Decision is a Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)-funded state administered
    program that provides free and reduced-price meals and snacks to children and
    adults in low-income areas, or approved by application, while at a day care home
    or facility. At the local level, CACFP is administered by state-approved sponsoring
    organizations. FNS issues program funds to state agencies, which then pass the
    funds to CACFP sponsoring organizations to run the program. Sponsoring organizations
    use that money to cover both the food and administrative costs of the program.
    FNS is contracted with Westat to develop an improper payment estimate for CACFP
    in accordance with a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP) submitted
    for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This study is nearing
    completion but has not yet been released. Previously, a study was done that found
    tiering error (claiming based on the higher level of pay of tier 1 rather than
    tier 2) among FDCHs to be a significant portion of the error in this program.
    FNS has applied the error rate determined by that study to the outlays for FDCHs.
    However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, tiering was set aside, and therefore the
    only measure of error that we would normally report was not applicable while this
    waiver was active. The outlays FNS is reporting are the outlays where tiering
    error was measured. Outlays for CACFP totaled $3.9 billion (pulled from FNS''s
    keydata report on September 8, 2023, Table 15d, https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/overview)
    for the entire Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. During FY 2023, FNS undertook and planned
    the following activities to mitigate CACFP improper payments: 1) State agencies
    must offer training to sponsors each year prior to the annual sponsor application
    period. The training covers the sponsoring organization’s responsibilities and
    the site supervisor’s responsibilities. Every sponsoring organization must send
    key staff members (including directors) to that State agency training in order
    to be eligible to participate in the program. As a condition of approval to participate,
    and as part of their program agreement with the State agency, sponsoring organizations
    commit to training their site monitors and site personnel. 2) FNS Regional Offices
    also completed three Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each of which include
    a local level review where FNS staff accompany State agencies on reviews of local
    operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of State agency operations and administration;
    and can result in a report of findings which require the state agency to correct
    any problems. This helps to ensure that State agencies are properly monitoring
    meal claims at the local level; and are working with local operators to reduce
    any improper payments.


    Correction to the 2022 Data Call:  The outlays reported in the 2022 Data Call,
    representing Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
    Tiering Decision Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 outlays, was incorrect. FNS reported total
    program outlays of $4.3B instead of FDCH Tiering Decision component costs of $581M.
    Currently, CACFPs sampling and estimation plan includes improper payment measurement
    for one of three components, the FDCH. The other two components, Child Care Centers
    and Adult Day Care Facilities, are not included in the improper payment reporting
    because FNS is still determining how to estimate the improper payment rates for
    these two components. As a result, the CACFP FDCH Tiering Decision improper payment
    estimate of 0.070% in the FY 2022 www.paymentaccuracy.gov reporting is lower than
    it should have been. The correct improper payment estimate should have been at
    0.527%.'
  rap5: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food Program
    (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to calculate
    annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census approach. Instead,
    FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies. FNS has developed
    a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision
    component of the program and is in the process of measuring errors or determining
    the feasibility of measuring errors in the remaining components - Child Care Centers
    and Adult Day Care Facilities. Because requirements vary significantly by program
    component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate of improper payments is
    extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative methodologies for developing
    a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision meal claims component. FNS
    has also completed data collection on a study to measure program error in childcare
    centers. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order to protect taxpayer
    dollars and safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on at child care.
    Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable rate for
    CACFP that fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while executing
    the program's processes to maximum possible effect as allowed under statute.
  rap6: "In order to establish and maintain internal controls in the Child and Adult\

    \ are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs\
    \ (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse.\
    \ A change of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases\
    \ to state and local index trends. \nAn additional $10 million increase is for\
    \ three current law proposals:\n• The first current law proposal increases funding\
    \ by $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS\
    \ provides tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver\
    \ specific programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program\
    \ proposal, the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special\
    \ Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition\
    \ Program Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for\
    \ more detail under the NPA section of this document. \n• The second proposal\

      \ a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously\
      \ states reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt\
      \ a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based\
      \ criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows\
      \ states to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS released\
      \ guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023. The rule also formalizes\
      \ a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process\
      \ improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied\
      \ through monitoring alone.\n\nCN Dashboards\nOn March 26, 2024, FNS made a\
      \ set of State Agency CN data dashboards available to State CN agencies. The\
      \ tool aims to promote state agency access to performance data for their own\
      \ analysis. To coincide with publishing the dashboards, FNS launched a CN dashboard\
      \ user group. Through the user group, FNS will provide support and analytic\
      \ strategies for users wishing to use the dashboard.\n\nProgress on CACFP Integrity\
      \ Studies\nFNS continues to explore feasible methods for assessing meal claiming\
      \ error at family day care homes."

    cyp4_1: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs are State-managed federal
      programs. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors, and
      ultimately to program recipients. Improper payments identified during the course
      of a review, audit, or other operational oversight activities can be recovered
      either through direct billing or through an offset of future program payments
      earned. FNS has been advised by our Office of General Counsel that since program
      statutes are very specific in describing circumstances under which recoveries
      of improper payments are to be made, recoveries made on the basis of a statistical
      sample or estimation procedure would not be appropriate, and that FNS would
      need new statutory authority to pursue such collections.
  pro1: In prior years, the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) improper payment
    rate only included estimates based on the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering
    study. With the completion of the analysis for Erroneous Payments in Child Care
    Centers Study (EPICCS), FNS is able to obtain an improper payment rate for Centers,
    and have split CACFP reporting into FDCHs and Centers. The FDCH improper payment
    rates utilize the same tiering error study as previous years but is only applied
    to Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Quarter 4, due to the Keep Kids Fed Act (KKFA) in effect
    for Quarter 1-Quarter 3. The KKFA  reimbursed all Homes at Tier I rates, equating
    to no tiering error and no improper payments. Note that in last year's FY2023
    reporting, FNS reported no error in CACFP because waivers allowed all FDCHs to
    receive Tier I rates for all quarters of FY2022.
  rap5: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food Program
    (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to calculate
    annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census approach. Instead,
    FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies. FNS has developed
    a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision
    component of the program, and a separate methodology for the remaining components
    of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via the Erroneous Payments
    in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements vary significantly
    by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate of improper payments
    is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative methodologies for developing
    a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision meal claims component. FNS
    is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order to protect taxpayer dollars
    and safeguard the meals that millions of children rely on at childcare. Therefore,
    FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable rate for CACFP that
    fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while executing the program's
    processes to maximum possible effect as allowed under statute.
  rap6: "An increase of $19,489,000 and 42 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) in Training\
    \ and Technical Assistance ($45,996,000 and 59 FTE available in 2024). \nEffective\
    \ and continual training and technical assistance are necessary to help States\
    \ properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States\
    \ are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. This includes a total\
    \ of $17.1 million for current law proposals, $3.8 million of which is for a 2025\
    \ proposal and $13.3 million is for 2024 re-proposals. The requested increase\
    \ includes $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal:\
    \ Increase Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation,\
    \ $1.3 million and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal\
    \ Administration of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation\
    \ and oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current\
    \ Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the Child\
    \ Nutrition (CN) Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget\
    \ lines. The next current law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff to support\
    \ the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical Assistance,\
    \ which enhances the Food and Nutrition Service’s ability to provide critical\
    \ training, technical assistance, and oversight to ensure program integrity and\
    \ compliance with Federal law and regulations for CN in both national and regional\
    \ offices. The fourth current law proposal for $2 million is to support the 2024\
    \ Current Law Re-proposal: Enterprise Risk Management: helps with approaches in\
    \ FNS strategic planning and program operations. The remaining increase is due\
    \ to inflation and 2025 pay cost. \n\nAn increase of $2,743,000 in CN Studies\
    \ ($21,005,000 and 13 FTE available in 2024). \nFNS conducts a variety of studies,\
    \ evaluations, and related activities that respond to the needs of policy makers\
    \ and managers and help ensure that nutrition assistance programs achieve their\
    \ goals effectively, which include improving public health, nutrition, and equity.\
    \ This program line supports the critical evaluations needed for the CN Programs,\
    \ including the Federal staff needed to oversee this vital work. The request includes\
    \ $2 million for the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Research on the U.S. Territories.\
    \ The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025 pay cost.\n\nAn increase\
    \ of $9,248,000 and 28 FTE in CN Payment Accuracy ($12,315,000 and 72 FTE available\
    \ in 2024).\nThis funding supports FNS’s robust Federal oversight, monitoring,\
    \ and technical assistance, which are essential to the identification, prevention,\
    \ and resolution of erroneous payments. This includes a total of $8.2 million\
    \ for current law proposals: $4 million and 20 staff to support the 2025 Current\
    \ Law Proposal: Investment in Regional Financial Management for Program Integrity,\
    \ which helps regional Grants Management and Administrative Services (GMAS) Staff\
    \ across CN Program accounts. The next current law proposal is for $3 million\
    \ to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Strengthen CACFP Program Integrity,\
    \ which will spread through a variety of activities including data mining and\
    \ a technical assistance support center designed to support States in identifying\
    \ and addressing program integrity risks. The third current law is for $1.2 million\
    \ and 8 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT. The balance of the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT is split between the CN Payment Accuracy and Training and Technical\
    \ Assistance budget lines. The remaining increase is due to inflation and 2025\
    \ pay cost."
  rnp3: "Serious Deficiency (SD) Proposed Rule\nThe Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)\

  rnp4: In order to ensure manager, program, and State-level accountability through
    annual performance appraisal criteria for payment integrity and meeting Improper
    and Unknown Payment reduction targets, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Child
    and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering Decision
    has implemented binding agreements to operate program according to all program
    rules. FNS has a robust review process that includes State-level review of local
    program operators and FNS-level reviews of States to ensure program integrity
    within the program. Applicable for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, FNS has issued a policy
    memo to State program operators of the CACFP FDCH Tiering Decision entitled, "Area
    Eligibility for Summer 2022 and School Year 2022-2023", providing guidance on
    determining CACFP eligibility when school data is unavailable. FDCHs use school
    or census data to establish geographic eligibility. FNS Regional Offices are completing
    three (3) Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each of which also includes
    a local level review where FNS staff accompany State agencies (SAs) on reviews
    of operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of SA operations and administration
    and can result in a report of findings, which require the SA to correct any problems.
    This helps to ensure that SAs are properly monitoring certification and meal counting
    at the local level and are working with local operators to reduce improper payments.
    In addition, FNS continues to provide technical assistance related to the $50M
    released in FY 2024 for non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds
    for Child Nutrition (CN) State agencies to improve information technology (IT)
    systems. Throughout FY 2023, FNS worked with grant recipients who are using funds
    to develop, improve, maintain CN IT systems. FNS expects that the overall improvement
    of information technology systems by nTIG recipients administering CACFP will
    improve the SAs ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and take
    corrective actions.
