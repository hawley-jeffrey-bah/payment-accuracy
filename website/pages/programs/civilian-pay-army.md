Actions_By_Year:
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed
      civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are
      signed by their Command partners. The reason this is still causing technically
      improper payments is that the employee’s current three to five year tour includes
      prior year SF1190s that are not being properly signed.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The majority of the technically improper and unknown
      payments were due to Standard Form (SF) 1190s with missing authorizing signatures.
      SF-1190s substantiate overseas entitlements like the Living Quarters Allowance
      and the Foreign Post Allowance. The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency
      (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure
      that block 25 of SF-1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses and block 26
      on all SF-1190 forms are signed by their Command partners. This is a requirement
      aligned with the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation Volume
      8, Chapter 3, subparagraph 4.1.1.  This mandate will prevent overseas entitlements
      from paying out to an employee without a properly signed SF1190; thus, substantially
      reducing (if not eliminating), technically improper and unknown payments in
      the coming years.


      Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated
      with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review
      and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with Command partners to resolve
      discrepancies as they are identified.

    rnp4: The Department of Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials
      Steering Committee (the Committee) was created in FY 2018, and it institutionalized
      a forum of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required
      by Appendix C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with
      the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired
      by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial
      Officer and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy
      Director of Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives
      from the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The Committee provides oversight
      to the DoD Payment Integrity program and drives action for compliance with the
      PIIA. More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of improper payments
      testing, the root causes of improper payments and appropriate actions to reduce
      them, payment recovery activities, and solutions to resolve DoD-wide audit findings
      and recommendations related to improper payments. Additionally, the Committee
      supports audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations,
      performance of risk assessments and oversees the identification of root cause(s)
      and the development and implementation of corrective actions to address areas
      of noncompliance.

Corrective_Actions_By_Year:
  2024:
    act17_1: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
      offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
      partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is
      that the employee’s current three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s
      that not being properly signed. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed
      will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct.
      CHRA will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with
      Command partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified.
    act17_2: A strong indicator of the adequateness of the planned corrective actions
      is they align with prior efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments. Specifically,
      the Army’s portion of the previous Department wide Civilian Pay program prior
      to the FY 2024 restructure was $108.57 million in FY 2023. In FY 2024 the restructured
      Army Civilian Pay program successfully reduced improper and unknown payments
      by $61.62 million down to $46.95 million. It is through this significant reduction
      in improper payments and subsequent ending amounts which are below the OMB statutory
      threshold that the Department is confident in the Army’s Civilian Pay corrective
      actions planned based off prior success.
    act17_3: The actions planned are only required for programs reporting an improper
      plus unknown payment estimate exceeding the statutory threshold. In the current
      reporting year, the Civilian Pay – Army program reported a total of $46.95 million
      in improper plus unknown payments, which is below the statutory threshold. Hence,
      no specific corrective actions are planned to be taken for this program. Furthermore,
      the Department anticipates the Civilian Pay - Army program to automatically
      move to Phase 1 in FY 2025 after achieving PIIA compliance. The U.S. Army Civilian
      Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that
      all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command partners. The reason
      this is still causing technically improper payments is that the employee’s current
      three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s that not being properly
      signed.
    rnp3: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
      offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
      partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is
      that the employee’s current three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s
      that not being properly signed. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed
      will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct.
      CHRA will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with
      Command partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified. Another strong
      indicator of the effectiveness of the planned corrective actions is they align
      with prior efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments. Specifically, the

    Unknown_Curent_Year_Plus_1_Amount: 8.3
    cyp15: 'Yes'
    cyp20_2: The Department’s Payment Integrity program - Army Civilian Pay’s reduction
      target is less than the estimated future Improper Payment and Unknown Payment
      rate. Currently the Army Civilian Pay estimated rate is $46.95 million which
      is substantially lower than the OMB statutory threshold and is expected to remain
      underneath the allowable $100 million in projected improper and unknown payment
      projections. The Department is confident in the Army’s ability to continue their
      progress in ensuring that the appropriate forms are fully signed and readily
      available going forward.
    rap5: 'Internal Controls:

      The Army has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
      payments in its Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.
      Moreover, Federal Civilian Pay Service, which support the end-to-end delivery
      of payroll processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational
      Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements
      (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2024.


      Human Capital:

      The Army has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Civilian
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as the Army’s
      Civilian Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
      and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Army has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has
      targeted. However, as technology advances, the Army and the Department continue
      to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian Pay. Lastly, the Automated
      Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing
      System (which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department) received
      an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2024.

      '
    rap6: The Army's Civilian Pay Payment Integrity program has not had any specific
      or known additional resources requested in their most recent budget submission.
      Furthermore, the ongoing corrective actions are cost beneficial and relatively
      straightforward to implement to ensure the proper signatures are on the appropriate
      and relevant forms.

    cyp2_1: The overpayments annotated as ‘Monetary Loss within Agency Control’ (MLA)
      are within the  Army’s control because the root cause of the overpayments is
      the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) processing the incorrect information on
      standard HRC personnel actions on the Standard Form (SF); specifically, the
      Standard Form (SF) 50, “Notification of Personnel Action” and/or the SF1190,
      “Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report” required to authorize the
      payment(s).  In many of these cases a retroactive personnel action can be processed
      to correct the employees pay record and recoup the over payments.  The Army
      can avoid this type of overpayment by ensuring the information on the SF50 and/or
      SF1190 contain the accurate pay information and personal information prior to
      sending the information to the payroll system for payment.  The root cause is
      human error through the lack of attention to detail when reviewing the personnel
      actions.  The Army prevents the majority of these similar errors by double checking
      the personnel actions and ensuring the appropriate signatures are on the required
      forms prior to sending to the payroll system.

    cyp6_1: The technically improper payment errors for Army were caused by payments
      received from improperly signed Standard Forms (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances
      Application, Grant and Report” that are required to authorize the payment(s)
      for submission into the payroll system for processing.  The employees were all
      entitled to receive the payments; however, because the SF1190 was not signed
      by all required parties, the payment was improper.  From the Department of Defense
      (DoD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 8 , Chapter 3 in subparagraph
      4.1.1, “Foreign differentials and allowances are paid upon receipt through the
      interface of a properly completed and signed SF 1190, Foreign Allowances Application,
      Grant, and Report.” In 2021, at the direction of senior leadership in Human
      Resource, SF1190s did not require all signatures because the information was
      being sent from the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) system to the payroll
      system.  This guidance was not accurate and could not be authorized because
      it was not in alignment with DoD FMR Volume 8 “Civilian Pay Policy.”

    cyp7_ucp4_1: The Army’s civilian unknown payments are very similar in nature to
      the technically improper payment errors for Army and were caused by payments
      received from an improperly signed Standard Form (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances
      Application, Grant and Report” that were sent to the payroll system for payment
      but also were missing additional key supporting documentation (KSD) required
      to authorize and substantiate these payment types.  The employees were all entitled
      to receive the payments, however technically, because the SF1190 was not signed
      by all required parties, the payment is improper.  From the DoD Financial Management
      Regulation (DoD FMR) Volume Civilian Pay Policy. Foreign Area. Allowances and
      differentials payable to employees officially stationed in foreign areas are
      established by the Secretary of State and published in the Department of State
      Standardized Regulations (DSSR). See Title 5 U.S. Code Sections 5921-5928. The
      DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1400.25-V1250 sets forth additional rules regarding foreign
      allowances and differentials for DoD civilian employees. Foreign differentials
      and allowances are paid upon receipt through the interface of a properly completed
      and signed SF 1190, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant, and Report.  In 2021,
      at the direction of senior leadership in the Army Human Resource Command (HRC),
      SF1190s did not require all signatures because the information was being sent
      from the HR system to the payroll system.  This guidance was not accurate and
      could not be authorized because it was not in alignment with the DoD FMR Volume
      Civilian Pay Policy.  The missing KSD for these errors were specifically missing
      the  Travel Orders authorizing the location and subsequently the Living Quarter
      Allowance amounts.  Travel Orders contain the location of the Duty Station.
    cyp8: The Army’s unknown payments are very similar in nature to the technically
      improper payment errors for Army and were caused by payments received from an
      improperly signed Standard Form (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances Application,
      Grant and Report” that were sent to the payroll system for payment but also
      were missing additional key supporting documentation (KSD) required to authorize
