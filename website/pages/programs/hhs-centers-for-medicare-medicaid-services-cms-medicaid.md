    cyp4_1: Federal funds are dispersed to states for Medicaid administration. States
      are then responsible for determining beneficiary eligibility and ensuring that
      claims are adjudicated properly. States mainly have issues with enrolled providers
      not appropriately screened by the state; providers not enrolled; and/or providers
      without the required NPI on the claim; enrolling a beneficiary when ineligible
      for Medicaid; determining a beneficiary to be eligible for the incorrect eligibility
      category, resulting in an ineligible service or incorrect federal reimbursement
      amount being provided; not conducting beneficiary redeterminations timely or
      at all; or not performing, completing, or providing sufficient documentation
      to support a required element of the eligibility determination process.

    the RY 2022 Medicaid improper payment rate due to a combination of improved state
    compliance and the impact of COVID-19 review flexibilities afforded to states.


    CMS is committed to strengthening and maintaining program integrity efforts to
    reduce improper payments rates. To reduce the Medicaid & CHIP improper payment
    rates, CMS developed several corrective actions that focus on system or process
    changes to reduce errors, including implementing new claims processing edits,
    converting to a more sophisticated claims processing system, implementing provider
    enrollment process improvements, implementing beneficiary enrollment and redetermination
    process improvements, and conducting provider communication and education to reduce
    errors related to documentation requirements.  CMS also recognizes the need to
    revisit its efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse to account for changing
    needs, technology, and practices.'

  act17_1: HHS addresses improper payments in Medicaid and CHIP through several corrective
    actions. HHS works closely with all states through enhanced technical assistance
    (including liaisons that are assigned to each state to assist with identifying
    and overcoming barriers to corrective action implementation) and guidance to develop
    state-specific corrective action plans to reduce improper payments. All states
    are responsible for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the corrective action
    plan’s effectiveness, with assistance and oversight from HHS. When developing
    corrective action plans, states focus on major causes of improper payments.
  act17_2: HHS addresses improper payments in Medicaid and CHIP through several corrective
    actions. To ensure that the corrective actions are adequate, HHS works closely
    with all states through enhanced technical assistance (including liaisons that
    are assigned to each state to assist with identifying and overcoming barriers
    to corrective action implementation) and guidance to develop state-specific corrective
    action plans to reduce improper payments. All states are responsible for implementing,
    monitoring, and evaluating the corrective action plan’s effectiveness, with assistance
    and oversight from HHS. When developing corrective action plans, states focus
    on major causes of improper payments.

  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: CMS anticipates an increase in the target rate due to a higher volume of
    eligibility redeterminations and provider screenings being performed by states
    subsequent to the end of the PHE. The target assumes a similar, but potentially
    slightly increased result by using the midpoint of the 2024 improper payment point
    estimate and the upper bound of the confidence interval.

  cyp6_1: States did not maintain documentation to support payment processing and
    beneficiary determinations. During data processing reviews, CMS was able to independently
    verify risk based screening requirements around database checks to show that the
    provider would have been eligible for payment had the state maintained documentation
    to show the screening requirements had been completed in accordance with regulations.
    During eligibility reviews, CMS was able to independently verify certain eligibility
    requirements through review of information gathered around separate determinations
    (i.e., not a Medicaid/CHIP determination) for the beneficiary that provided reasonable
    support that the beneficiary was eligible.

    cyp4_1: Federal funds are dispersed to states for Medicaid program administration.
      States are then responsible for determining beneficiary eligibility and ensuring
      that claims are adjudicated properly. States mainly have issues with enrolled
      providers not appropriately screened by the state; providers not appropriately
      rescreened at revalidation; providers not enrolled; providers without the required
      NPI on the claim; enrolling a beneficiary when ineligible for Medicaid; determining
      a beneficiary to be eligible for the incorrect eligibility category, resulting
      in an ineligible service or incorrect federal reimbursement amount being provided;
      not conducting beneficiary redeterminations timely or at all; or not performing,
      completing, or providing sufficient documentation to support a required element
      of the eligibility determination process, such as income verification.
  pro1: 'The Reporting Year (RY) 2024 Medicaid improper payment rate decreased from
    the RY 2023 Medicaid improper payment rate due to a combination of improved state
    compliance and the impact of COVID-19 review flexibilities afforded to states.


    CMS is committed to strengthening and maintaining program integrity efforts to
    reduce improper payments rates. To reduce the Medicaid & CHIP improper payment
    rates, CMS developed several corrective actions that focus on system or process
    changes to reduce errors, including implementing new claims processing edits,
    converting to a more sophisticated claims processing system, implementing provider
    enrollment process improvements, implementing beneficiary enrollment and redetermination
    process improvements, and conducting provider communication and education to reduce
    errors related to documentation requirements.  CMS also recognizes the need to
    revisit its efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse to account for changing
    needs, technology, and practices.'
  rap5: A tolerable rate has not been established for this program. The tolerable
    rate will be identified when the methodology is developed. Once the tolerable
    rate is developed, the agency can determine if we have what is needed with respect
    to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure
    to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: "To establish and maintain payment integrity internal controls in HHS included\
    \ the following program integrity proposals in its FY 2026 Budget request:\n\n\
    •\tBolster Medicare & Medicaid Affiliations Provision by Targeting Problematic\
    \ Nursing Home Owners and Decreasing Provider Affiliations Reporting Burden \n\
    •\tStrengthen CMS’s Ability to Protect Beneficiary Access to Care and Reduce Medicaid\
    \ and CHIP Beneficiary Eligibility Errors\n"
  rnp3: 'Annually, the agency identifies the root causes of improper payments and
    underpayments and develops specific corrective actions to address them. This work
    is reported on through the agency financial report process.


    HHS works closely with all states through enhanced technical assistance (including
    liaisons that are assigned to each state to assist states with identifying and
    overcoming barriers to corrective action implementation) and guidance to develop

    are responsible for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the corrective action
    plan’s effectiveness, with assistance and oversight from HHS. When developing
    corrective action plans, states focus on the major causes of improper payments.'
  rnp4: 'The agency''s improper payments and underpayments reduction targets and progress
    towards meeting those goals are reported annually in the Agency Financial Report
    (AFR). In addition, the agency sets annual Government Performance and Results
    Act (GPRA) goals related to the improper payment rates and reports quarterly on
    specific corrective actions to address improper payment rates through the quarterly
    scorecard process for high-priority programs.


    In FY 2024, HHS continued implementing a robust state-specific Payment Error Rate
    Measurement (PERM) Corrective Action Plans process that provides enhanced technical
    assistance and guidance to states. HHS works with states to coordinate state development
    of corrective action plans to address each error and deficiency identified during
    the PERM cycle. After each state submits its corrective action plan, HHS monitors
    the state’s progress in implementing effective corrective actions. HHS continued
    the development of its enhanced corrective action process. HHS also provided training
    opportunities to ensure compliance with federal policies through the Medicaid
    Integrity Institute (MII).

Description: 'Medicaid is a joint federal/state program, administered by HHS, that
  provides health insurance to eligible low-income individuals and long-term care
  services to seniors and disabled individuals. Overpayments occur because: providers
  are not properly screened by the state or not enrolled; the National Provider Identifier
  is not on the claim; a beneficiary is enrolled when ineligible or determined to
  be eligible for the incorrect eligibility category; beneficiary redeterminations
  are not conducted in a timely manner; sufficient documentation is not provided to
  support eligibility determinations. Barriers to prevention include: high state employee
  turnover, lack of state employee training, and insufficient eligibility edits.'
