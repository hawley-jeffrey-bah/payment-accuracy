    in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs.  Direct certification
    is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification error in
    Local Education Agency processing of household applications.

    As a part of the overall strategy to improve processes and technology for State
    agencies, FNS will distribute the funding available to improve State systems and

  cyp20_2: The Covid-19 pandemic changed School Breakfast Program (SBP) operations
    beginning in March 2020 that affect improper payments due to certification error,
    which is the primary component of SBP improper payments. More specifically, beginning
    March 2020, School Food Authorities (SFAs) had the option to adopt waivers that
    allowed them to serve free meals to all participants through the National School
    Lunch Program's (NSLPs) Seamless Summer Option (SSO) or the Summer Food Service
    Program (SFSP) without the need for applications. Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
    recognized that State Agency's (SAs) and SFAs needed additional support and flexibility

    and managing the impacts of Covid-19. In School Year (SY) 2021-2022, SFAs had
    the option of operating SSO or NSLP/SBP and almost all SFAs (90%) chose the SSO
    waiver, covering approximately 98% of total meals served in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-2022.
    Under SSO, all participants receive free meals and SFAs do not need to conduct
    eligibility determinations, so certification error does not apply for SFAs that
    used the waiver in SY 2021-2022. As a result, it is not included in the error
    rate for FY22. Aggregation error, on the other hand, still applies as SFAs are
    still serving and counting meals. Due to the operational flexibilities mentioned
    above, data that would allow FNS to age the improper payment estimates is not
    available for FY22. Therefore, FNS used the aggregation error point estimate from
    the Access, Participation, Eligibility and Certification (APEC) III study as its
    measure of improper payments in SBP. The point estimate reflects the most current
    assessment of error in the traditional SBP, unaffected by temporary changes to
    the program due to Covid-19, and therefore is the most reflective rate of school
    meal operations in FY22.

      to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies and sponsors (schools
      and school food authorities or school districts) determine children’s eligibility
      for program benefits and serve meals to children. All of this activity occurs
      prior to the point that states submit claims to FNS for federal payment. Although
      FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does engage in extensive training,
      issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity audits in an effort to help
      states, and the local organizations under their oversight, improve program performance
      and limit program error.
  rap5: The School Breakfast Program (SBP) does not have an administrative infrastructure
    for producing yearly estimates of improper payment rates and dollar values. Therefore,
    Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses periodic Access, Participation, Eligibility,
    and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate estimates for
    SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates using the baseline
    data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic indicators.
  rap6: "In order to establish and maintain internal controls in the School Breakfast\
    \ Program (SBP), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has requested the following\
    \ budget increases to the Child Nutrition Block, of which SBP is included (Source:\

    \ of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance ($34,214,000 estimated\
    \ in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical assistance are necessary\
    \ to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) and to\
    \ ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent fraud and abuse. A change\
    \ of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000 reflects increases to\
    \ state and local index trends. \nAn additional $10 million increase is for three\
    \ current law proposals:\n• The first current law proposal increases funding by\
    \ $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration. While FNS provides\
    \ tools, training, and resources to help state and local operators deliver specific\
    \ programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this is a cross-program proposal,\
    \ the costs of this initiative are being shared with the SNAP, Special Supplemental\
    \ Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program\
    \ Administration (NPA) accounts. The full proposal can be referenced for more\
    \ detail under the NPA section of this document. \n• The second proposal is for\

    \ support. This proposal addresses ability to better respond to state and local\
    \ policy and operational issues and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’\
    \ Ability to Provide Timely Program Technical Support” current law proposal for\
    \ more details. \n• The third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated\

      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the National
      School Lunch Program (NSLP) to encourage adoption of a FNS-developed tool to
      reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the DVS
      is an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit

      preliminary results, it will be able to review this first measure of program
      error since the COVID pandemic, when all meals were served free regardless of
      family income. Now that schools have returned to using the National School Lunch
      (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) for determining household eligibility,
      serving healthy, nutritious meals, and claiming reimbursement for those meals,
      FNS is especially interested in Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification
      (APEC) IV's results to help understand current NSLP/SBP operations as opposed
      to using pre-COVID improper payment baseline.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      Through a rulemaking effective October 26, 2023, the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) lowered the eligibility threshold for school participation in the CEP
      from an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) of 40% to 25%. FNS research shows
      that schools participating in CEP have notably lower certification error than
      schools that do not participate. Based on these findings, FNS expects that increased
      CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction
      in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule
      was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we
      expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from
      this change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.  FNS released supporting
      guidance material, including a fact sheet, published February, 2024.

      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      FNS is engaged in research related to integrity in the National School Lunch
      Program(NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). APEC IV has completed data collection
      and will soon move on to analyzing data to establish an NSLP/SBP improper payment
      (IP) rate. With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use
      a new baseline estimate for IP in NSLP and SBP, improving our projected error
      rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study
      also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications.
      From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in
      online applications used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price
      meals.

      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and State administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS
      released guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023. The rule also
      formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused
      process improvements to address IP challenges that cannot be remedied through
      monitoring alone.

      Direct Certification with Medicaid Demonstration (DC-M)

      FNS approved 5 new states to participate in the DC-M Projects for school year
      (SY) 2024-2025. Once the 5 new states implement the DC-M matching, the total
      number of states participating in DC-M will be 43. FNS research confirms that
      participation in DC-M improves program integrity by replacing the traditional
      household application for school meal benefits with an automated data match
      against existing household income records.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1

    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will provide guidance
      and technical assistance to those states and local education agencies (LEA)
      that are interested in choosing or have already chosen to take advantage of
      the newly lowered the minimum Identified Student Percentage (ISP) that expands
      access to the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP).  Lowering the minimum ISP
      gives states and LEAs greater flexibility to offer no-cost meals to all enrolled
      students.  Electing CEP is a voluntary decision made by LEAs based on their
      unique student populations, and FNS understands that lowering the minimum ISP
      will result in more schools being eligible for CEP.  However, it is essential
      to ensure financial viability for newly eligible schools electing CEP at lower
      ISPs. FNS's guidance and technical assistance will help LEA decisionmakers consider
      student nutrition, educational, administrative, and financial factors prior
      to electing CEP.  FNS will provide technical assistance to State agencies and
      coordinate with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services when needed to help
      ensure their readiness to conduct successful, accurate projects, and understand
      reporting requirements.  Communication with State agencies will continue through
      implementation and early period of matching activities.

      Service (FNS) programs are state-managed federal programs. As such, program
      payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies (SAs), which then pass
      through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The activity that gives rise
      to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies and sponsors (schools

      for program benefits and serve meals to children. All of this activity occurs
      prior to the point that States submit claims to FNS for federal payment. Although
      FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does engage in extensive training,
      issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity audits in an effort to help
      States, and the local organizations under their oversight, improve program performance
      and limit program error.

    \ $3.8 million and 19 staff to support the 2025 Current Law Proposal: Increase\
    \ Funding for Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Implementation, $1.3 million\
    \ and 7 staff to support the 2024 Current Law Re-proposal: Federal Administration\
    \ of Summer EBT. Both current law proposals support Federal implementation and\
    \ oversight of the new Summer EBT program. The balance of the 2024 Current Law\
    \ Re-proposal: Federal Administration of Summer EBT is split between the CN Payment\
    \ Accuracy and Training and Technical Assistance budget lines. The next current\
    \ law proposal is for $10 million and 16 staff to support the 2024 Current Law\
    \ Re-proposal: Increase Training and Technical Assistance, which enhances the\

  rnp3: 'Process Change - Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

    The Food and Nutrition service (FNS) expects that increased CEP eligibility will
    correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction in certification error,
    and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule was published after the
    CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we expect that the full magnitude
    of decreases in improper payments resulting from change will not fully be observed
    until SY2024-2025.

    Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

    With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use a new baseline
    estimate for improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and
    School Breakfast Program (SBP), improving our projected error rates by starting
    with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study also includes a component
    that examines integrity features of online applications. From this sub-study,
    FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications used
    by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.

    Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

    FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs,
    at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help
    FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types, resulting
    in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program requirements.
    Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows states to adopt
    a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously
    States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt a
    review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based criteria
    to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows States to direct
    limited resources where attention is needed most.

    The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
    integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges
    that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.

    Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)

    Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified for
    free meals without the need for a household application based on household participation
    in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct certification
    is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification error in
    Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.

    Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)

    FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by
    nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State''s ability to train,
    monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.

    Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

    FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to encourage
    adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting of NSLP administrative
    data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is an Application Programming
    Interface (API) that States can include in their platforms for collecting data
    from their school districts. The DVS provides real-time edit checks and error
    messages to school districts as they submit data to their States.'
  rnp4: Program sponsors and operators have binding agreements with the administering
    State Agencies (SAs) to operate Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) School Breakfast
    Program (SBP) according to all program rules. SAs have binding agreements with
    FNS to administer the Federal programs in accordance with applicable regulations,
    guidance, and instructions. FNS has a robust review process that includes state-level
    review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of SAs to ensure program
    integrity in SBP. Additionally, at the federal level, senior executives are held
    responsible for program oversight and integrity via the annual strategic planning
    process and performance system.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is committed to ensuring integrity in the
    School Breakfast Program (SBP) in order to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard
    the meals that millions of children rely on during the school year. Therefore,
    FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined a tolerable rate for SBP that
    fully balances payment integrity risk and controls while executing the program's
    processes to the maximum possible effect as allowed under statute.

Description: 'The School Breakfast Program (SBP) is a federally assisted meal program

  operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions.
  It

  reimburses participating schools and institutions for the cost of providing meals
  to eligible children. SBP overpayments are primarily due to errors in determining
  children''s eligibility for program benefits. Errors in counting and claiming meals
  for federal reimbursement is a secondary source of over payment. The most significant
  barrier to prevention is the decentralized nature of the program. Certifying children
  for benefits and counting meals for reimbursement are handled independently by tens
  of thousands of schools and school districts.'
