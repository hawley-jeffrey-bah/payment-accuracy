Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of overpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
      the cause of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements
      of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority
      of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract
      terms. The majority of technically improper payments occurred because VA lacked
      proper delegation for the order placed. The majority of unknown payments occurred
      because VA lacked information in the contract price schedule. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding change process include restructuring
      existing local and national contracts, requiring secondary level of approval
      on invoices by contract specialists prior to payment, and rejecting invoices
      that do not comply with contract requirements, including no receipt for goods
      or services. Additionally, VA will ensure ordering processes are compliant with
      statute and regulation, thus reducing technically improper payments caused by
      unauthorized commitments. These actions are designed to reduce overpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      were attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.  Change
      process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal
      controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      However, the actions were not fully implemented/completed during the FY 2023
      reporting year and are still in progress as of the beginning of FY 2024. The
      cause of overpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
      the cause of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements
      of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority
      of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract
      terms. The majority of technically improper payments occurred because orders
      were placed by ordering officers without written delegation to place the funded
      order. The majority of unknown payments occurred because VA lacked information
      in the contract price schedule. Although the overall corrective actions were
      not fully implemented/completed during FY 2023, tasks within the actions were
      completed to move the overall action implementation forward. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding change process included identifying
      remedies for improper and unknown payments. Examples include continued restructuring
      existing local and national contracts, required secondary level of approval
      on invoices by contract specialists prior to payment, implemented ordering systems,
      and rejected invoices that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally,
      VA ensured ordering processes were compliant with statute and regulation, thus
      reducing technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments. Although
      the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY
      2023 for actions addressing improper and unknown payments, tasks within the
      actions were completed to move the overall action implementation forward.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include improving contract processes
      for the Medical Supplies Prime Vendor payments and the Nutrition and Food Services
      payments to ensure payment accuracy. In addition, VA will provide education
      and training to contracting officers and/or ordering officials to ensure contracts
      contain required signatures and proper approvals are obtained prior to placing
      orders. Finally, the VA will restructure existing contracts and provide education
      and training to certifying officials for rejecting invoices that do not comply
      with contract requirements. These actions were designed to reduce overpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

  2022:
    pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper
      and unknown payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of reductions
      and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
      Act of 2019 for FY 2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Supplies
      and Materials program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 6.81%
      to 4.03% (2.78% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $216.94 million
      to $132.01 million ($84.93 million reduction).
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper
      and unknown payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions
      and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
      Act of 2019 for FY 2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Supplies
      and Materials program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 4.03%
      to 3.55% (0.48% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $132.01 million
      to $117.46 million ($14.55 million reduction).  Given the time it takes to implement
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued
      positive impact of these actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment
      rate.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
      payments. The Supplies and Materials projected improper and unknown payments
      remain under the 10% compliance threshold established by the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 for the fifth consecutive year. Further, the program
      underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will increase its ability to reduce improper
      payments in the future. Through implementation of effective corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies, Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments from
      $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31 million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction despite
      a $395 million increase in outlays. VA plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective
      actions related to high-risk program areas as well as increase the FY 2025 sample
      size to gain additional insight into the root cause errors occurring.
    rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
      General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds
      for a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers
      and program personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments
      as appropriate. This will include various mitigation strategies such as change
      process. These actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024 payment
      integrity testing. VA’s executive managers to include the Executive Director
      of Acquisition and program personnel will be held accountable through annual
      performance criteria contained within their performance plans. Performance criteria
      will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties. Depending on each employees’
      responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper and unknown payments
      through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments if appropriate,
      and implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper and unknown
      payments. State and local governments are not involved in the execution of this
      program.

      in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Supplies
      and Materials program indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were
      closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, two were
      open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and
      one was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate
      the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis
      to refine the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce
      root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $12.55 million in FY 2020 to $3.83 million in FY 2021, or
      a 69% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not
      met, associated corrective actions contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $281.73 million in FY 2020 to $144.21 million in FY 2021,
      or a 49% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or
      improper, associated corrective actions did not reduce the unknown payment amount
      from FY 2020 to FY 2021.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as

  2024:
    act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
      were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause of technically
      improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of the program not
      met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable to determine
      whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments occurred
      because the claim was not paid according to contract terms. The majority of
      technically improper payments resulted from lack of ordering officer delegation
      documentation. The majority of unknown payments resulted from invoice pricing
      that did not reconcile to the contract. Change process was the best mitigation
      strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
      existing payment processes.
    act17_2: 'Although the overall error rate for this program increased from 3.55%
      in FY 2023 to 7.57% in FY 2024, VA made improvements. Through implementation
      of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Supplies and Materials
      reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31 million in FY 2024,
      or a 96% reduction despite a $395 million increase in outlays. VA plans to expand
      and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas.


      VA''s process for development of corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      ensures the severity of the error is considered and the action is adequate.
      VA''s corrective actions and mitigation strategies have been evaluated by the
      Office of Inspector General during their FY 2024 annual audit and determined
      reasonable with no recommendations for improvement. The overpayments were attributed
      to VA''s failure to access data/information. The technically improper payments
      were attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met. The unknown
      payments were attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Actions taken included restructuring existing local and national contracts and
      rejecting invoices that do not comply with contract requirements, including
      no receipt for goods or services. Additionally, VA ensured ordering processes
      were compliant with statute and regulation. Actions planned regarding change
      process include VA will improve contract processes for the Medical Supplies
      Prime Vendor payments and the Nutrition and Food Services payments to ensure
      payment accuracy. In addition, VA will provide education and training to contracting
      officers and/or ordering officials to ensure contracts contain required signatures
      and proper approvals are obtained prior to placing orders. Finally, VA will
      restructure existing contracts and provide education and training to certifying
      officials for rejecting invoices that do not comply with contract requirements.'
    act17_3: 'VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
      and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned
      are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and
      unknown payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly
      basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure
      if an action has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown
      payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness
      review process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure
      continued progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas
      for improvement were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine
      the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root
      cause(s) of error.


      Through implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
      Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to
      $0.31 million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction despite a $395 million increase

      in accordance with the contract rate or to validate goods billed on invoices
      were received prior to issuing payment. The agency has the direct ability to
      prevent overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes
      to ensure goods or services are received and by simplifying contract pricing.

    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed. Specifically, overpayments occur
      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Supplies
      and Materials is able to validate the correct payment to be made per the invoice
      or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements will allow for more
      accurate payment validation.

    cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to the invoice pricing
      not reconciling to contract that was required to validate whether a payment
      was proper or not. The agency was missing documentation which contained key
      information that would have enabled the agency's ability to discern whether
      the payment was proper or improper. The missing documentation contained information
      such as the patient roster, contract price schedule, or despite having a contract
      price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract due to
      lack of detail in the invoice or price schedule. For these reasons, we are unable
      to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper without that documentation.

      that includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the
      contract price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule
      and/or the vendor's invoice. For example, VA receives an invoice of $10 for
      one pair of surgical scissors; however, the contract price schedule is $30 for
      "surgical supplies" and does not specifically include a line item and rate for
      the billed pair of surgical scissors. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude
      whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional
      cost details in the contract price schedule.
    cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing. Specifically, the
      agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack information
      in the contract price schedule. Without documentation supporting the appropriate
      contract rate information, the program is unable to determine whether the amount
      paid is proper or improper.
