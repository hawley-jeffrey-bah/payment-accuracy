    its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Specifically, from FY20
    to FY21, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program decreased its error
    rate from 95.34 percent to 72.80 percent (22.54% reduction) and improper payments
    from $2,547.91 million to $1,895.26 million ($652.65 million reduction). Due to
    PLTSS reporting over $100 million of overpayments/monetary loss in FY 2021, PLTSS

  cyp20_2: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports reduction target is equal
    to the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
    reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper payment
    estimates.  Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic.
    One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
    improper payments legislation is that it can take three years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '1048.64'
  cyp6: '1048.38'
  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, the payment failed to meet all regulatory and/or statutory requirements.
    Specifically, either the order was placed by an unauthorized individual, VA was
    unable to obtain written documentation to support the ordering officer delegation,
    a valid contract or provider agreement was not in place when required, or the
    contract document was not properly signed and dated by the Contracting Officer.
    These resulted in technically improper payments.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to the payment, authorization,
    or pricing that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or not.
    The agency was missing documentation which contained key information that would
    have enabled the agency's ability to discern whether the payment was proper or
    improper. The missing documentation contained information such as the contract
    price list, authorization, or valid payment data.

    cyp2_1: Overpayments are within the agency control. The agency has the direct
      ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving efficiencies in
      the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally, system
      improvements will allow for automation of the authorization review, decreasing
      human error. These improvements will allow for more accurate payment certification.

  pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its second consecutive year of reductions.
    Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports
    program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 72.80% to 47.45% (25.35%
    reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $1,895.27 million to $1,285.50
    million ($609.77 million reduction).
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all
    requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget
    guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is
    not aware of additional program needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
    a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Purchased Long Term Services
    and Supports program indicated that of the five  actions assessed, one was closed
    and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was closed and
    determined to be ineffective in mitigating the root cause, two were open and determined
    to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined
    that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements
    could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment
    amount from $158.38 million in FY 2020 to $74.79 million in FY 2021, or a 53%
    reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
    reduction in the improper payment amount from $2,131.72 million in FY 2020 to
    $912.36 million in FY 2021, or a 57% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine
    whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies
    did not reduce the unknown payment amount from FY 2020 to FY 2021.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      to ensure invoices are being validated per the contract pricing prior to payment.
      VA will also implement short and long-term contracting options for Community
      Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. In
      addition, VA will enforce contract requirements for third party administrators
      to bill at the correct allowable rates. These actions are designed to address
      overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information,
      technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program
      not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order
      to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment
      processes.

    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include working
      to determine if a system update in the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System is needed to ensure Homemaker/Home Health Aide Service, Community Nursing
      Home, and Veteran Directed Care claims are paid appropriately. VA will then
      develop an effective corrective action for implementation. These actions are
      designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes
      and human error.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app1_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q3
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding automation to address overpayments
      and underpayments included moving all future purchased care to be processed
      through the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System or by third party
      administrators. This will ensure correct authorization, amount of care, and
      correct rate. These actions were taken to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information. Although the overall corrective
      actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY 2023 for actions addressing
      underpayments, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action
      implementation forward.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp1_1

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken regarding change process included monitoring
      errors related to the legacy community care system, which were considered timing
      issues, and should no longer occur with the implementation of the MISSION Act.
      Additionally, VA simplified the documentation request process and utilized tools
      that targeted missing documentation. These actions were taken to address technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met
      and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper
      or improper.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate the appropriate reimbursement rate per the
    contract or agreement. However, the agency currently does not have the documentation
    necessary to determine if the payment is proper or not. Specifically, VA is not
    always able to price home hospice care. This occurs when the provider status is
    not current with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the dates of
    service to validate the appropriate pricing. The missing documentation needed
    will assist VA in determining whether or not the billed amount on the claim or
    the paid amount is accurate. For this reason, we are unable to conclude whether
    the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without that documentation.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation to validate the appropriate contract or agreement pricing. Specifically,
    the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack of
    provider status in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services covering the
    dates of service. Without documentation supporting the valid rate to calculate
    the appropriate reimbursement amount, the program is unable to determine whether
    the amount paid is proper or improper.

    cyp2: '318.46'
    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate payment was made in
      accordance with the contract rate, a valid agreement was in place and/or the
      provider is eligible per the contract or agreement covering the billed dates
      of service, billed services did not exceed the authorized care and were eligible
      per regulatory or contractual requirements, and payment is made in the appropriate
      amount and/or is paid the lesser of billed charges or local VA fee schedule.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving controls in the payment processes, implementing system enhancements
      to include a prepayment check, and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorization review, decreasing
      human error. These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its third consecutive year of reductions.
    Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports
    program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 47.45% to 38.72% (8.73%
    reduction). Due to needs and increased costs, the program did see an increase
    in outlays of 35.18%; therefore, although the program did successfully reduce
    its rate of improper and unknown payments, its overall reported improper and unknown
    payments increased. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these
    actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include working internally with facilities
      to provide education and training to resolve missing documentation errors related
      to authorization, payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process.
      These actions are designed to reduce unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation strategy
      to communicate the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included working to ensure invoices are
      being validated per the contract pricing prior to payment. Additionally, VA
      worked to implement short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing
      Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. Finally,
      VA clarified payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at
      the correct rates. These actions were taken to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Although
      the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY
      2024, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action implementation
      forward. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop
      stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include moving to a standardized rate
      schedule for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition payments
      from a legacy system to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally,
      VA will continue clarifing payment methodology with third-party administrators
      to bill at the correct rates, and will implement short and long term contracting
      options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement
      requirements. In addition, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving
      missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice
      vendor, and will work to establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate.
      These actions are designed to address overpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. Change process was the best
      mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included updating the claims processing
      system to pay or deny Homemaker/Home Health Aid Service, Community Nursing Home,
      and Veteran Directed Care claims appropriately. These actions were taken to
      address overpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and
      unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Although the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed
      during FY 2024, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall
      action implementation forward. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because
      improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes and human error.

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of FY 2024 overpayments
    and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause
    of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of
    the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable
    to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments
    occurred because claims were not paid according to the contracted rates. The majority
    of underpayments occurred because a payment system error resulted in the payment
    being made in an amount less than the contract or agreement rate. The majority
    of technically improper payments occurred because a purchase was made without
    a contract utilizing a Basic Ordering Agreement, which is not a contract. The
    majority of unknown payments occurred because VA was missing documentation such
    as a valid consultation or missing information on the claim document to be able
    to verify substantially all clean claim requirements were met per the contract
    or agreement. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because improper payments
    resulted from manual processes and human error. Change process was the best mitigation
    strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
    existing payment processes. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
    the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.
  act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 38.72% in FY 2023 to 13.52%
    in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $657.90 million, by implementing effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
    is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
    FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
    The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information,
    technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of the
    program not met, and unknown payments were attributed to being unable to determine
    whether proper or improper. Actions taken regarding automation included updating
    the claims processing system to pay or deny Homemaker/Home Health Aid Service,
    Community Nursing Home, and Veteran Directed Care claims appropriately. Actions
    planned regarding automation include updating the claims processing system to
    pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions
    taken regarding change process include working to ensure invoices are being validated
    per the contract pricing prior to payment. Additionally, VA worked to implement
    short and long term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to
    improve compliance with procurement requirements. Finally, VA clarified payment
    methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct rates. Actions
    planned regarding change process include moving to a standardized rate schedule
    for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition from a legacy system
    to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifying
    payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable
    rates, and will work to implement short- and long-term contracting options for
    Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements.
    Further, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures
    and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will establish
    Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. Actions planned regarding training
    include working internally with facilities to provide education and training to
    resolve missing documentation related to authorization, payment or Veteran level
    of care to support the payment process.
  act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and
    no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are
    appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown
    payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly basis.
    Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure if an action
    has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments for
    a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness review
    process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued
    progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas for improvement
    were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. The decrease
    in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from 38.72% in FY 2023 to 13.52%
    in FY 2024 and the $657.90 million reduction in improper and unknown payments
    supports the effective implementation and prioritization of action within the
    agency.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports reduction target is equal
    to the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
    reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown
    payment estimates. Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and
    realistic. One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to
    comply with improper payments legislation is that it can take three to five years
    from the point an error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective
    action, implement it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested
    the following year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

  cyp6_1: VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
    to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
    and/or statutory requirements. Specifically, a valid contract or provider agreement
    was not in place when required for Community Nursing Home care. Most technically
    improper payments resulted from purchases being made without a contract utilizing
    a Basic Ordering Agreement, which is not a contract. These resulted in technically
    improper payments for failing to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation section
    Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General (Part
    1.601) or VA MISSION Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-182).

  cyp7_ucp1_1: VA is required to validate that the provider or third-party administrator
    submits a clean claim. However, the agency currently does not have the documentation
    or information necessary to determine if the payment is proper or not. Specifically,
    the claim does not always comply with substantially all clean claim requirements
    per the contract or agreement. This occurs when the claim lacks the information
    necessary to process the claim or the information submitted was insufficient.
    For this reason, we are unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper
    at time of payment without that documentation or information. The missing documentation
    or information needed from the will assist VA in determining whether or not the
    billed amount on the claim or the paid amount is accurate.
  cyp7_ucp4: '56.54'
  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate that a valid consultation is completed or
    documentation supporting the billed level of care is provided by the VA facility
    prior to processing the payment. However, the agency currently does not have the
    documentation necessary to determine if the payment is proper or not. This occurs
    when the claim lacks the information necessary to process the claim or the information
    submitted was insufficient. For this reason, we are unable to conclude whether
    the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without that documentation.
    The missing documentation or information needed will assist VA in determining
    whether or not the billed amount on the claim or the paid amount is accurate.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
    documentation to validate that clean claim requirements were met per the contract
    or agreement. Specifically, the claim was missing key elements that are required
    per the contract or agreement terms. Additionally, VA had missing or insufficient
    documentation to validate the appropriate consultation, claim documentation, or
    documentation supporting the billed level of care to confirm the appropriate payment
    amount. Without documentation supporting the required claim elements, the program
    is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

    cyp2: '218.3'
    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate payment was made in
      accordance with the contract rate and in the appropriate amount per regulation,
      billed services did not exceed the authorized care, and claims were received
      within the required timeframes. For contract related instances, the Community
      Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA is invoiced
      in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines and VA is responsible
      to ensure the contract terms are met. The agency has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes,
      implementing system enhancements to include a prepayment check, and simplifying
      contract pricing. Additionally, system improvements will allow for automation
      of the review of claim data against the authorization, decreasing human error.
      These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of reductions.
    Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports
    program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 38.72% to 13.52% (25.20%
    reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $1.42 billion to $760.09 million
    ($657.90 million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of
    these actions on its FY 2025 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
    Office acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
    using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: "The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize\

  rnp4: This program was determined noncompliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
    General and reported improper and unknown payments above required thresholds for
    a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers and program
    personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as automation, change process,
    and training. These actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024
    payment integrity testing. VA’s executive managers to include the Deputy Executive
    Director for Geriatrics and Extended Care and program personnel will be held accountable
    through annual performance criteria contained within their performance plans.
    Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties. Depending
    on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper and
    unknown payments through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments
    if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper
    and unknown payments. State and local governments are not involved in the execution
    of this program.
