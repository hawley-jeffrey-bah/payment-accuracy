  pro1: 'Based on guidance from OMB on 10/25/2022, HUD did not report improper payment
    estimates for rental assistance programs TBRA and PBRA as the full payment lifecycle
    could not be verified and testing was unable to be completed. HUD was unable to
    produce estimates due to limitations in obtaining supporting documentation needed
    for testing in a timely manner for FY 2022 disbursements. Without estimates, HUD
    could not determine whether its improper payment plus unknown payment estimate
    was below or above the statutory threshold. As a result, HUD could not implement
    corrective actions and other OMB requirements for programs above the statutory
    threshold. HUD did not perform testing of the full payment cycle for RHAP - TBRA
    and PBRA related to FY 2022 payments due to lack of compliance readiness, including:
    need of further training of personnel at all levels of the payment cycle, resource
    limitations, key person dependencies, and the delay of full implementation of
    corrective actions around privacy and security concerns. Due to this scope limitation,
    HUD is not reporting an error rate for PBRA and TBRA for the FY 2023 reporting
    cycle. Target date is FY2027, dependent on funding.'

  act17_1: 'The level of IP and UP are below HUD''s payment integrity testing for
    the complex multi-layered PBRA processes requires a sophisticated approach to
    effectively assess risk. The greatest risk of improper payments occurs outside
    of HUD''s direct control. The variability in payment controls and documentation
    significantly increases the complexity and risk when testing the full payment
    lifecycle, a high-risk area identified by both HUD and the Office of Inspector
    General (OIG). The identified corrective actions aim to reduce the unknown payments.
    They will provide knowledge to the Owners/Agents on their role in the testing
    process. Due to the absence of adequate documentation from the Owners/Agents to
    substantiate the payments, resulted in the identification of the unknown payments
    In FY24. With improved understanding and support regarding the documentation requirements,
    Owners/Agents will have additional knowledge to furnish the correct documents,
    thereby significantly reducing the number of unknown payments.  If Owners/Agents
    understand and are able to provide the correct documents this could potentially
    reduce the extrapolated error in the statutory level of improper payments.

  act17_2: 'Corrective actions to be undertaken in FY25 are adequate as they target
    the root cause of the unknown payments. After receiving training, the Owners/Agents

    correct documentation after failing to do so initially.


    '
  act17_3: 'Corrective actions are implemented and prioritized to reduce unknown payments.
    Planned actions for PBRA Eligibility to reduce unknown payments focus on training
    Owners/Agents on what is required from them to verify payments. These trainings
    will be prioritized and implemented early in the FY25 testing process. The Unknown
    Payment rate for FY25 will be compared to FY24 as a gauge of the corrective actions
    success and whether continued further actions must be implemented.
