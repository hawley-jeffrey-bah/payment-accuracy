  cyp6_1: The main causes of technically improper payments in the DoD Travel Pay program
    are invalid documentation (e.g. invalid receipt) and failure to following proper
    procedures for travel voucher submission (e.g. missing signature).
  cyp8: The vast majority of DoD unknown payments are due to the traveler failing
    to upload the receipt for various travel expenses (most commonly lodging, rental
    car, and airfare) to the Department’s travel system (Defense Travel System or
    DTS). A valid receipt shows the name of the entity providing the goods/services,
    the dates that the goods/services were provided, the price, any tax levied, the
    total amount due, and must indicate that the total amount was paid. Hence, a missing
    receipt precludes the payment reviewer from determining if the payment was proper
    or improper.

    cyp2_1: The vast majority of the improper or unknown payments in the DoD Travel
      Pay program are due to the missing or invalid receipt on the travel voucher.
      The root cause of the missing or invalid receipts is the traveler failing to
      submit a proper receipt and/or the authorizing official approving the travel
      voucher for payment without ensuring a proper receipt is attached. Hence, the
      improper payments are within the agency control as the travelers and authorizing
      officials are agency employees.

  pro1: The DoD Travel Pay program includes payments disbursed by the Defense Finance
    and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine
    Corps to Active, Reserve, and National Guard Military Service members and civilian
    employees for temporary and permanent travel and transportation-related expenses.
    The Department currently uses Defense Travel System (DTS) for its temporary travel
    and Integrated Automated Travel System (IATS) for its permanent travel. The Department
    is currently in the process of replacing the DTS with SAP Concur – MyTravel, a
    commercial-of-the-shelf solution. This system migration is anticipated to greatly
    reduce the occurrence of improper payments once fully deployed across the Department.
  rap5: "Internal Controls:\nThe Department has the internal controls in place to\
    \ support the reduction of improper payments in the DoD Travel Pay program to\
    \ the levels the Department has targeted, and the Department is making efforts\
    \ to ensure those internal controls are followed. For example, the Defense Finance\
    \ and Accounting Service (DFAS) Post-Pay Review & Analysis (PPRA) team is sending\
    \ monthly reports to all components detailing their improper payment rates and\
    \ the top causes of improper payments. Regular training is provided to educate\
    \ the travelers and approvers to help address those top causes and on proper travel\
    \ pay regulations and procedures. In addition, Defense Travel Management Office\
    \ (DTMO) distributes a monthly newsletter which covers latest travel news, events,\
    \ and training information. Currently, DTMO is planning to use the newsletter\
    \ to bring attention to the DFAS PPRA reports and ways to address the issues reported.\n\

  rap6: The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity
    Team is not aware of any specific payment integrity related budget submission
    for the DoD Travel Pay program.
  rnp3: "The actions taken and planned by the DoD Travel Pay program address the root\
    \ causes of the improper payments which are lack of awareness and proficiency\
    \ in travel regulations and procedures by the travelers and their authorizing\
    \ officials, and travel system limitations. \n\nThe Department has taken various\
    \ actions to increase the communication and educate the workforce on travel procedures.\
    \ Top errors are identified by performing reviews of the travel payments throughout\
    \ the year and focusing the communication and training on those top trending travel\
    \ pay errors identified by the Defense Financial and Accounting Service (DFAS)\
    \ Post-Pay Review team. Communication and training efforts include: individual\
    \ email notifications sent by DFAS to notify individuals making errors, bi-weekly\
    \ Travel Assistance Center Senior Site calls which cover top travel issues, monthly\
    \ post pay review reports sent by DFAS to travel pay leadership with information\
    \ about their current improper payment rate and top improper payment errors, detailed\
    \ error workbooks explaining each error and allowing for rebuttals sent by DFAS\
    \ to travel pay managers, Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) newsletters\
    \ addressing latest travel news, events, and training information, Defense Travel\
    \ System (DTS) push notifications, and various training events. \n\nIn addition\
    \ to the lack of training which is contributing to the improper and missing receipt\
    \ issues in the travel vouchers, the Department recognizes that many of the issues\
    \ related to receipts are furthered by vendors not offering receipts that satisfy\
    \ the department's regulations, or the limitations of the current travel management\
    \ system, DTS. To improve its travel management, the Department is investing into\
    \ a new travel management system, MyTravel which comes with built in capabilities\
    \ that should prevent or resolve the improper and missing receipt issues. The\
    \ new system will also include an enhanced audit feature, Detect, that should\
    \ discover and prevent probable improper payments before they occur."

  rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department
    can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently
    in Phase II. The DoD OIG concluded that the previous Department estimates were
    unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable which led to
    insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull
    the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department has since
    implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
    for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans,
    created a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
    of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
    Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved
    by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes
    by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and
    process will produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the Department’s
    efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
    the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD OIG
    confirmed reliable estimates; the Department will be able to establish effective
    and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

      remediation training for approving officials causing improper payments.  The
      Department will continue to ensure travel-related training is provided across
      the Department.  Error trend analysis will be leveraged to determines training
      focus areas.  Approving officials are provided remediation training and monitored
      for repeat improper payments.  If repeat improper payments are found, the approving
      official is removed from approval responsibilities.  A robotics program identifies
      and corrects unauthorized approval accesses, and personal granting these accesses
      are monitored for repeat offenses to remove from DTS duties.  The Department
      continues its focus on the benefits of effective management, internal controls,
      focused training, and accountability.

    Description_Action_Taken: Periodic training conducted at military bases and mandatory
      training provided to approving officials.  Every four months, the Army conducted
      a Travel PIIA Program collaborative session with the Army Commands, Army Service
      Component Commands, Direct Report Units and Field Army’s Lead Defense Travel
      Administrators (LDTA).  Twice a year, the Army command’s G-8 GS-15, Colonel
      or Chief of Staff equivalent attends with their respective LDTA.  In these two
      sessions during DTS testing year, the USAFMCOM Army Financial Services (AFS)
      Director addressed and emphasized the significance of the travel PIIA program,
      the importance of timely and accurate voucher settlement (supported by valid
      documentations), objectives, guidance, assistance and various training available
      to the Army commands.  Each month, the USAFMCOM AFS briefed the commanding general
      and staffs and the Army National Guard and Army Reserves representatives on
      the performance of travel PIIA program, initiatives, requirements and actions
      for accurate, timely and properly documented DTS vouchers.  Training targeting
      the most common causes of improper payments were included in FY2023 training
      to Navy commands (e.g., examples of valid and invalid receipts).  Navy also
      coordinated with DTMO to include better examples of valid and invalid receipts
      in DTS 101 Training.

  cyp20_2: The Defense Travel System process is decentralized, requiring the Department
    to appoint routing official and approving official roles to personnel at each
    command.  These roles are typically collateral duties, and experience frequent
    turnovers (lack of continuity) and subsequent inefficiencies.  The regulations
    governing federal/military travel are large and complex, requiring stakeholders
    to become subject experts in a collateral duty role.  The travel program also
    requires travelers to understand the complex set of regulations, and relies on
    individual travelers to provide supporting documentation to process claims.  Until
    travel regulations are simplified, travel systems are intuitive enough, automated
    controls can be more relied on, and subject experts can be relied upon (i.e.,
    centralizing travel settlements where approving officials can have continuity
    and become subject experts), the Department will likely continue to exceed statutory
    thresholds.

  cyp6_1: DoD travelers, reviewing officials, and approving officials/certifying officers
    were not properly justifying or reviewing DTS claims.  Reviewing and approving
    officials must fully understand the rules and required substantiating documents
    for travel pay entitlements, including the requirements of a proper receipt for
    substantiating travel-related expenses.  The pillars of travel pay (the traveler,
    reviewing official and approving official), particularly the reviewing and approving
    officials, must ensure travelers provide valid documentations to support proper
    reimbursements for the traveler’s expenses incurred in the performance of official/business
    travel missions.  Approving/Certifying Officials failing to identify vendor invalid
    receipts and verifying adherence to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulations prior
    to approving travel expenses exacerbates the underlying issues associated with
    the DoD’s reliance on Travel Pay record-keeping systems that are decentralized,
    heavily interfaced, manually intensive, and susceptible to human error.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: Some organizations, within the Department, review and approve Defense
    Travel System (DTS) vouchers without first validating that travelers upload proper
    documentations to justify associated expenses.  The approving officials/certifying
    officers do not always match the traveler’s claimed expenses to the valid documents
    to support reimbursement.  Nor, do these approving officials return the DTS voucher
    to the traveler requesting the document(s) for expenses such as lodging/hotel,
    rental cars, and other authorized travel expense.  Organizations do not routinely
    generate internal reports to assist and track completion in the voucher review
    process.  An end-to-end tracking and management program should have been enforced
    to ensure instances of missing or invalid documents are resolved in a timely manner.  Additionally,
    vendors fail to provide receipts that meet the Department’s requirements.  There
    are no known industry standards for vendor receipts.  Without a valid receipt,
    the certifying officer is unable to determine whether there was a valid reimbursable
    expense incurred.
  cyp8: The travelers did not furnish proper documents to substantiate claims for
    the expenses incurred during official travel.  The travelers’ reviewing/approving
    official also overlooked this requirement to support reimbursement upon the Defense
    Travel System (DTS) voucher review and approval process.  The pillars of the travel
    pay program also did not conduct an end-to-end solution and exercise internal
    controls to resolve the absence of valid documentations from travelers prior to
    ensuring the voucher is pay-ready.

    cyp2_1: The vast majority of the improper or unknown payments in the DoD Travel
      Pay program are due to the missing or invalid receipt on the travel voucher.
      The root cause of the missing or invalid receipts is the traveler failing to
      submit a proper receipt or the authorizing official approving the travel voucher
      for payment without ensuring a proper receipt is attached. Hence, the improper
      payments are within the agency control as the travelers and authorizing officials
      are agency employees.

  rap6: The DoD Travel Payment Integrity program did not have any known additional
    resources requested in the most recent budget submission.
  rnp3: Lack of understanding official travel requirements is the primary root cause
    of improper payments.  The Department of Defense (DoD) will continue utilizing
    error trend analysis from post pay reviews as to determine areas of focus for
    training.  By targeting additional training for repeat offenders and/or removing
    approval responsibilities, the Department will instill accountability at every
    level of the program.  Due to the Department utilizing year in arrears in the
    Travel Pay program, the effectiveness of actions taken will be determined when
    FY2023 actual travel payment results are measured.  For invalid receipts, the
    policy change to permit use of other corroborating documentation only resolves
    issues with receipts that do not meet the DoD's definition.  For instances where
    the traveler provides documentation that is other than a receipt (e.g., hotel
    reservation, flight itinerary, or rental car pickup slip), awareness training
    and command accountability will continue to be focus areas.  Resources, guidance,
    support, training, and communication are continuous.  Payment Integrity personnel
    provide commands detailed information, data, and recommendations to reduce improper
    payments and unknown payments.  The DoD Travel Pay program's performance metrics
    and solutions are discussed, explained, and tracked for resolutions.  Effective
    management and oversight will ensure reviewing officials and approving officials
    comply with regulatory guidance and conduct duties to standard that would ensure
    timely and accurate (with valid supporting documentations) DTS voucher disbursements.
