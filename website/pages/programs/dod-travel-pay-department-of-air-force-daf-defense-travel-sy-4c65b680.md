  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: FY2026
    Description_Action_Taken: The bot described previously will continue to run every
      two weeks until the proper internal controls are addressed in the Defense Travel
      System (DTS) by DTMO to prevent wrongful granting of DTS permission levels.
      Additionally, the DTS system has the technology today to identify improper payments
      through their Compliance Tool (CT), but only applies this technology post-payment.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The training corrective actions as described previously
      are continuous. They will continue on a monthly basis as long as there are DAF
      approving officials approving improper payments within Defense Travel System
      (DTS).  In addition to these, the DAF is implementing a quarterly training for
      component and installation level travel pay teams, to help them better train
      and assist their travelers, approving officials, and reviewing officials.

      The root cause for invalid receipts being submitted for travel related payments
      includes the following:

      Travel related payments are processed in DTS with invalid or missing receipts,
      and missing information needed to properly substantiate the travel payment.

      The monthly and quarterly training will address the invalid or missing receipts
      as well as the missing information needed to properly substantiate the travel
      payment.

    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Behavioral/Psych Influence
    Completion_Date: FY2026
    Description_Action_Taken: The behavioral/psych influence corrective actions described
      in previously are continuous.  They began during FY24 and will continue on a
      monthly basis as long as there are DAF approving officials approving improper
      payments within DTS.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app2_1
  - Action_Taken: Not Completed
    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: The corrective action was not fully completed this reporting
      period
    Description_Action_Taken: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) identified a material
      weakness with the DTS system itself that does not have proper internal controls
      for permission level access.  The issue allows anyone with access to appoint
      others to approving official role (without necessarily vetting for proper appointment
      and training completion).  Therefore, DAF has implemented the biweekly use of
      an automation bot to remove approving official permissions for any DAF AOs without
      properly appointed on a DD Form 577 located in the Forms and Account Management
      Service (FAMS) system and without completion of mandatory training. The bot
      compares the list of individuals with approving official permissions in DTS
      with the list of appointed and trained DTS DAOs in FAMS, and automatically removes
      the individuals’ permissions who are not properly appointed as a DAO or have
      not fulfilled all required training as indicated in FAMS.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp1_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Behavioral/Psych Influence
    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: The behavioral/psych influence corrective actions taken
      by the Department of the Air Force (DAF) include the release of metrics by command
      and unit to call out those with a high rate of improper payments.  The most
      notable behavioral/psych influence corrective action is the notification to
      an approving official’s command team when they have been identified of approving
      three or more improper payments and are required to attend remedial training.  Further
      is the notification to an approving official’s command team when they have failed
      to attend the required remedial training and are being removed for non-compliance
      and failure to meet the requirements of a DAF approving official.

    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: "The Department of the Air Force (DAF) has implemented\
      \ the following initiatives to address training needs.  \n1.) Since February\
      \ 2023, the DAF has required Mandatory DTS Approving Official Training for all\
      \ newly appointed Approving Officials and Reviewing Officials and for all Approving\
      \ Officials identified as having approved three or more improper payments. \
      \ This training is designed specifically to address the common errors found\
      \ by the DTS PPR as well as the DTS Compliance Tool.  It also includes all new\
      \ and recent policy changes regarding travel entitlements, which may not be\
      \ known to the larger population of travelers and approving officials. It includes\
      \ specific examples of proper and improper receipts and clearly articulates\
      \ all the requirements for a valid receipt. The training also teaches approving\
      \ officials and reviewing officials how to review and adjust per diem amounts\
      \ in the per diem screens of DTS. \n2.) To address the lack of knowledge and/or\
      \ awareness of newly implemented policy changes affecting travel entitlements,\
      \ the DAF has implemented a new process to disseminate notification of all JTR\
      \ or DAF travel policy changes from SAF/FM to the AFIMSC, NGB, and AFRC Component\
      \ Travel Pay Leads to the installation DTS (Lead Defense Travel Administrator\
      \ (LDTA). All DAF LDTAs have now been notified and trained to disseminate this\
      \ information and provide guidance and explanation to their ODTAs, Approving\
      \ Officials, Reviewing Officials, and Travelers to ensure all are properly informed;\
      \ and \n3.) The DAF has also implemented a monthly travel topic notification\
      \ to disseminate directly to all installation comptroller squadrons.  This notification\
      \ includes tips and FAQs in addition to any new or changing policies or procedures.\n\
      4)\tThe DAF began using established training methods and venues, concentrate\
      \ training on one of the top five error's each month applying the results from\
      \ the latest DTS Post Pay Review.\n5)\tThe DTS Air Force Accounting and Finance\
      \ Office (AFAFO) provided the Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) with the listing\
      \ of the Air Force bases piloting the robotics solution to DTS which would address\
      \ an identified material weakness on DTS unauthorized approvals.  Implemented\
      \ the DTS robotics solution to validate its effectiveness in reducing improper\
      \ payments.\n6)\tAFIMSC tracks Approving Official (AOs) and Air Force bases\
      \ train AOs identified as having approved an improper payment on the DTS Post\
      \ Pay Reviews. Metrics developed will focus on verifying remediation actions\
      \ for officials who cause improper payments.  Tracked remediation actions in\
      \ QART will include training on specific errors to create process improvement\
      \ loop, and ultimately removal from position if behavior is not corrected.\n"

    PPR and Compliance Tool Metrics briefed in front of their peers at leadership
    briefings.  The Approving officials are held accountable through the repercussions
    associated with the requirement for mandatory remedial training, the notification

    of the Air Force (DAF) approving official, and ultimately through the removal
    of their role as a DAF approving official if they continue to approve improper
    payments and fail to complete remedial training. It is incumbent upon the commanders/supervisors

  cyp7_ucp4_1: The primary cause for Department of the Air Force's Defense Travel
    System (DTS) unknown payments were payments awaiting corrective action by travelers
    and/or approving officials.  For example, proper hotel, airline, or rental car
    receipts were not attached, and were awaiting the traveler’s action to provide
    proper receipts in DTS or awaiting the approving official’s action to approve
    the amended voucher in DTS.  At the point identified in the review, there was
    not enough evidence to determine if the payment was a proper or improper, as the
    final documentation needed to be provided was missing.  An example of missing
    documentation required to determine if a payment is proper or improper, which
    resulted in the classification of unknown is a valid airfare receipt.  Some travelers
    inadvertently upload their travel itinerary instead of their final invoice/receipt.  Unfortunately,
    there may have been adjustments made to the travel, which resulted in a change
    in price/expense incurred.  If so, this would be an improper payment with either
    an overpayment or underpayment.  If not, it would be a technically improper payment.

    cyp2_1: Overpayments associated with the Department of the Air Force (DAF) Defense
      Travel System (DTS) vouchers are within the DAF’s overall control and responsibility.   The
      DAF is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of its payments to include DTS
      travel vouchers.  There were several contributing factors identified. The DAF’s
      current construct does not allow for a centralized approach to DTS authorization
      and voucher management for Temporary Duty (TDY) members.  The agency has adopted
      a decentralized approach to allow each unit to handle their own travel needs.  Unfortunately,
      we have discovered this approach correlates to an increased number of approving
      officials (AOs) who are not fully aware of the requirements for validating meal
      authorizations and appropriate lodging rates in the per diem screen of DTS,
      which make up a large portion of our overpayments. The DAF has taken action
      to ensure all newly appointed AOs and all AOs identified as having approved
      3 or more improper payments receive mandatory initial and/or remedial AO training
      to reduce improper payments.  Further, all AOs who do not comply with the training
      requirements, will have their AO permissions removed within 10 days of the established
      training deadline.
