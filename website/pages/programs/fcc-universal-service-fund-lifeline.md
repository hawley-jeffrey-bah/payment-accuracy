  act17_1: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, will continue to implement an Improper
    Payment Analysis. Through this process, USAC management performs an analysis of
    its improper payments to understand the root cause and to identify corrective
    actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with USAC management, the USAC’s
    Fraud Risk Group has developed a process to evaluate common root causes in an
    effort to identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action
    is needed.
  act17_2: The most impactful corrective actions are focused on focused on the robust
    Quality Assurance process to confirm eligibility.  USAC manually reviews appropriate
    documentation to confirm that a consumer is eligible to participate in the Lifeline
    program and is not receiving duplicative support.  The Lifeline Program will review
    the root cause of the errors identified in the assessments and will perform updates
    to training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation.
  act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue to
    review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
    accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
    improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
    a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
    identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is needed.
    This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective actions
    as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future instances
    of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly review process
    to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.

    Quality Assurance (PQA). Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling methodology
    to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC, USF-LL, USF-RHC,
    and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is to estimate an improper
    payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules. To recover improper
    payments, the FCC and USAC have implemented an enterprise recovery policy to standardize
    the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All improper payments are deemed
    collectible and funding is either recovered or is in the process of being recovered.'
