    cyp2_1: Risk Management Agency considers overpayment inside our control when the
      data/information needed does exist and can be accessed however, a breakdown
      in the administrative or procedural processes caused the payment to become improper.  Improper
      payments within the agency’s control result from errors such as inadvertent
      keying errors, calculation errors, administrative errors, or procedural errors.  Reducing
      overpayments within the agency control can be accomplished by strengthening
      quality control processes at the Approved Insurance Provider (AIP) level.

  rap5: At this time, the agency has the necessary resources to reduce improper payments.  This
    assumes that the program remains at the current size.  If the program expands,
    additional resources may be necessary.
  rap6: The agency’s most recent budget request includes funding to comply with A-123
    and financial statement audit requirements, higher staffing and hiring needs,
    and migrate and modernize information technology systems. The agency currently
    has enough resources to reduce improper payments; however, additional resources
    are necessary to sustain program growth and increasing costs.
  rnp3: Failure to access data/information accounted for $169.93M of Risk Management
    Agency's improper dollars.  COVID-19 required Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs)
    to modify how day to day operations were conducted.  These unforeseen modifications
    presented an opportunity for less effective quality control processes resulting
    in payments being issued improperly.  RMA's corrective action plan to address
    these types of improper payments includes meeting with AIPs assess their quality
    control processes they currently have in place.  This will be carried out as part
    of RMA's AIP Performance Reviews.  Improper payments resulting from the inability
    to access data/information address errors made at the time of certification.  Improper
    payments associated with this root cause totaled $134.72M.  To address certification
    errors RMA continually reviews current policy and procedures directly related
    to areas in which the improper payments have occurred.  Strengthening current
    policy and procedure requirements is a means of improving the effectiveness of
    the certification process.

    Description_Action_Taken: A majority of the improper payments related to the inability
      to access data/information were the result of policyholders over-reporting insurable
      acres on rainfall index plans of insurance.  RMA will issue an Informational
      Memorandum reminding external stakeholders of procedural requirements related
      to acreage reporting and reiterate the importance of applying these procedures
      accurately to prevent improper payments.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q3
    Description_Action_Taken: A large amount of RMA's improper payments resulting
      from the inability to access data/information are situations where policyholders
      could not support certifications with acceptable production evidence/records.  As
      a result, RMA Compliance worked with the Product Management Branch to update
      the Apple Crop Policy record requirements in for vertically integrated or direct-marketing
      perennial producers.

    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: Improper payments resulting from a failure to access
      data/information are often the result of process and/or administrative type
      errors (i.e., keying errors, calculation errors, process errors, etc.,) To address
      these types of errors, RMA Compliance reviewed Approved Insurance Provider's
      (AIP's) quality control processes as part of the AIP Performance Review (APR)
      allowing RMA to identify potential vulnerabilities that may lead to improper
      payments.  If vulnerabilities are identified, RMA issues APR outcomes and/or
      observations in which the AIP must respond with a corrective action and a timeframe
      for completion.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: One type of error leading to improper payments for failure
      to access data/information resulted from policies established under a unit structure
      that did not meet the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria
      that must be met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When
      these qualifications are not met the result is an improper payment. To further
      assess improper payments associated with unit structure, RMA will conduct a
      program review in order to determine if Approved Insurance Providers are appropriately
      applying unit structure requirements.

      a breakdown in an administrative or procedural process caused the payment to
      become improper.  Due to the nature of these types of errors (i.e., inadvertent
      keying errors, calculation errors, process errors, etc.) Risk Management Agency
      has the ability to identify root causes and address deficiencies in the quality
      control processes at the Approved Insurance Provider (AIP) level resulting in

    cyp4_1: The Risk Management Agency (RMA) partners with private insurance companies,
      Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs), to deliver the federal crop insurance program
      through agents who sell policies directly to producers.  The Standard Reinsurance
      Agreement which is an agreement between RMA and the AIPs restricts agents and
      AIPs from influencing the premium for a given policy, such as a producer's certification.  Overpayments
      outside the agency's control typically consist of certification errors by the
      policyholder.  These errors include, but are not limited to; inadvertent errors,
      misinterpretation of policy, calculation errors, or the inability to support
      certifications when documentation is requested.  These types of errors are determined
      to be outside the agency's control or unavoidable because they take place during
      certification stages of the crop insurance program.
  rap5: At this time, the agency has the necessary resources to reduce improper payments.  This
    assumes that the program remains at the current size.  If the program expands,
    additional resources may be necessary.
  rap6: The agency’s most recent budget request includes funding to comply with A-123
    and financial statement audit requirements, higher staffing and hiring needs,
    and migrate and modernize information technology systems. The agency currently
    has enough resources to reduce improper payments; however, additional resources
    are necessary to sustain program growth and increasing costs.
  rnp3: RMA's comprehensive analysis of improper payment criteria relates the root
    cause (i.e., the type of error that led to the improper payment, who was responsible
    for the improper payment, and at what stage of the crop insurance life cycle the
    improper payment occurred) of the improper payment directly to the amount of the
    improper payment.  This strategic assessment allows RMA to develop corrective
    action plans that address the root causes that result in larger amounts of improper
    payments. A continuous analysis of root causes and implementation of corrective
    actions that help remediate improper payments has allowed RMA to maintain a tolerable
    error for multiple years.  Federal Crop Insurance is a multi-billion-dollar program.
    RMA’s ability to maintain a improper payment error rate below three percent for
    the past nine years indicates the effectiveness of the measures we’ve taken to
    reduce improper payments.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payment associated with the inability
      to access/data information, RMA will conduct a program assessment of the Spot
      Check List procedures utilized and corrective actions carried out by the Approved
      Insurance Providers (AIPs). To execute this audit, RMA’s Northern Regional Compliance
      Office (NRCO) will obtain documentation used by the AIPs to conduct their reviews
      and support their determinations. Once obtained, the documentation will be reviewed
      to verify compliance with Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) policy and
      procedure.  The anticipated impact of this corrective action is to ensure that
      all AIPs are conducting Spot Check List reviews according to procedure.  In
      auditing AIP performance, RMA hopes to reduce potential program vulnerabilities,
      improper payments, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program.


      Improper payments associated with the failure to access data/information are
      often related to errors in which external stakeholders do not follow Federal
      Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)  policies and procedures.  To address these
      types of errors RMA’s Southern Regional Compliance Office (SRCO) will be conducting
      a Cotton Loss Adjustment Program Review.  This review will determine if AIPs

  act17_1: Upon the completion of RMA’s improper payment review cycle extensive results
    data is captured and analyzed for the purpose of determining root causes.  This
    analysis affords the agency the ability to evaluate the payment processes in order
    to pinpoint any procedural gaps or inefficiencies that led to the improper payments.  By
    focusing on these areas, corrective actions developed can effectively mitigate
    the risk of improper payments recurring in the future.
  act17_2: RMA’s root cause analysis provides the agency the ability to effectively
    identify the underlying causes of the improper payments.  Corrective actions are
    tailored to specific types of improper payments identified, whether they stem
    from procedural errors, inaccurate certification, or administrative deficiencies.  Once
    the root causes have been identified, corrective plans are implemented, monitored,
    and evaluated. Results are shared with stakeholders to ensure accountability and
    foster a culture of continuous improvement helping reduce future improper payments.
  act17_3: Corrective actions are effectively implemented by first establishing clear
    objectives and assigning specific responsibilities to team members.  Regular monitoring
    and feedback meetings ensure that progress is tracked and any obstacles are promptly
    addressed. RMA’s Payment Integrity Specialist communicates with stakeholders carrying
    out the plans in order to assure they are prioritized to meet all applicable deadlines.  This
    strategic approach fosters a clear understanding among team members of where to
    direct efforts, enhancing overall productivity and accountability.

    events may often lead to expedited processes which could increases the probability
    of errors overlooking essential verification steps and maintaining compliance
    with established standards, thereby affecting overall payment integrity and the
    ability to meet reduction targets.
