Actions_By_Year:
  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access
      data/information, the cause of technically improper payments were attributed
      to statutory requirements of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments
      were attributed to unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular,
      the majority of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according
      to contract terms. The majority of underpayments occurred because the claim
      was paid less than the lease agreement rate. The majority of technically improper
      payments occurred because the purchase was made without a contract. The majority
      of unknown payments occurred because VA lacked information in the contract price
      schedule. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop
      stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding change process include restructuring
      existing local and national contracts, requiring secondary level of approval
      on invoices by contract specialists prior to payment, and rejecting invoices
      that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally, VA will ensure
      ordering processes are compliant with statute and regulation, thus reducing
      technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments. These actions
      are designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure
      to access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation
      strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
      existing payment processes.

    Description_Action_Taken: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown
      payments and developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.
      The cause of overpayments and underpayments were attributed to failure to access
      data/information, the cause of technically improper payments were attributed
      to statutory requirements of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments
      were attributed to unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular,
      the majority of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according
      to contract terms. The majority of underpayments occurred because the claim
      was paid less than the lease agreement rate. The majority of technically improper
      payments occurred because VA procurement was done utilizing a VA Form 1358 when
      a request should have been sent to procurement to create a contract. The majority
      of unknown payments occurred because VA lacked information in the contract price
      schedule. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop
      stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: "Actions taken regarding change process to address overpayments\
      \ and underpayments included identifying remedies for improper and unknown payments.\
      \ Examples include continued restructuring existing local and national contracts,\
      \ required secondary level of approval on invoices by contract specialists prior\
      \ to payment, implemented ordering systems, and rejected invoices that do not\
      \ comply with contract requirements. Although the overall corrective actions\
      \ were not fully implemented/completed during FY 2023 for actions addressing\
      \ overpayments and underpayments, tasks within the actions were completed to\
      \ move the overall action implementation forward. \n\nActions taken regarding\
      \ change process included issuing procurement policy updates and reminder memos\
      \ for responsible personnel to ensure contracts are compliant with the Federal\
      \ Acquisition Regulations and monitoring the use of compliant contracts in the\
      \ electronic contract management system to prevent lack of request for procurement\
      \ action. Additionally, VA continued conducting an annual concurrence process\
      \ to meet with field offices which ensures accuracy of testing results and improves\
      \ understanding of requirements for future purchases. VA also obtained additional\
      \ documentation required to determine payment accuracy. These actions were taken\
      \ to address technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements\
      \ of the program not met and unknown payments attributed to being unable to\
      \ determine correct payment amounts."

  2022:
    pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of
      reductions and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 for FY 2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022,
      the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased its improper
      and unknown error rate from 3.58% to 2.70% (0.88% reduction) and improper and
      unknown payments from $63.92 million to $49.10 million ($14.82 million reduction).
    rnp4: null
  2023:
    pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of
      reductions and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 for FY 2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023,
      the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased its improper
      and unknown error rate from 2.70% to 2.49% (0.21% reduction). Due to needs and
      increased costs, the program did see an increase in outlays of 16.93%; therefore,
      although the program did successfully reduce its rate of improper and unknown
      payments, its overall reported improper and unknown payments increased. Given
      the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
      the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on its FY
      2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
    rnp4: null
  2024:
    pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program continued to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduced
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of
      rate reductions and projections under the statutory threshold for significant
      improper payments of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from
      FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased
      its improper and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57%, a reduction of 1.92%
      and improper and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82
      million reduction). At this time, VA is reporting under the statutory thresholds
      established for payment integrity and the Communications, Utilities, and Other
      Rents program will revert to fulfilling legislative requirements for risk assessments
      no less than every three years. Management will also continue its responsibilities
      for internal control outlined in the Government Accountability Office's Green
      Book.
    rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the OIG and reported
      improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for a compliance determination
      in FY 2025. Given the FY 2024 reported improper and unknown payment rate is
      below statutory thresholds, the program will not be required to set or meet
      applicable reduction targets. However, in FY 2025, VA executive managers and
      program personnel will continue responsibilities for internal control outlined
      in the Government Accountability Office’s Green Book. VA’s executive managers
      to include the Executive Director of Acquisition and program personnel will
      be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained within their
      performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all
      their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can include
      preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal controls,
      recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts
      for known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments
      are not involved in the execution of this program.

    act17_3: null
    rnp3: VA continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
      mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced
      by its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Specifically, from
      FY20 to FY21, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased
      its error rate from 12.23 percent to 3.58 percent (8.65% reduction) and improper
      payments from $213.94 million to $63.92 million ($150.02 million reduction).

    rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
      in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Communications,
      Utilities, and Other Rent program indicated that of the four actions assessed,
      two were closed and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause,
      one was open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause,
      and one was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively
      mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root
      cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they
      address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $4.28 million in FY 2020 to $1.07 million in FY 2021, or
      a 75% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not
      met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a
      total reduction in the improper payment amount from $209.44 million in FY 2020
      to $27.87 million in FY 2021, or an 87% reduction. For errors tied to unable
      to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation
      strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2020 to FY 2021.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action
      plans implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as
      well as to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported
      in FY 2023.'

      review will be reported in FY 2024.'
  2024:
    act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
      and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, the
      cause of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements
      of the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority
      of overpayments occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract
      terms. The majority of underpayments occurred because the claim was paid less
      than the lease agreement rate. The majority of technically improper payments
      occurred due to lack of requests for procurement action. The majority of unknown
      payments occurred because VA lacked information in the contract price schedule.
      Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger
      internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
    act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 2.49% in FY 2023 to 0.57%
      in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $39.82 million by implementing effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
      is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
      FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
      The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to VA's failure to access
      data/information, technically improper payments were attributed to statutory
      requirements of the program not met, and unknown payments were attributed to
      being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Actions taken regarding
      change process included restructuring existing local and national contracts
      and rejecting invoices that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally,
      VA ensured ordering processes were compliant with statute and regulation, thus
      reducing technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments.
    act17_3: VA updated corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
      and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned
      were appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and
      unknown payments. VA monitored progress and results of implementation on a quarterly
      basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review was performed annually to measure
      if an action planned had reduced or was properly designed to reduce improper
      and unknown payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The
      annual effectiveness review process allowed VA to create or update actions as
      necessary to ensure continued progress in the remediation of improper and unknown
      payments. If areas for improvement were identified, VA conducted a root cause
      analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address
      and reduce root cause(s) of error. The decrease in the improper payment and
      unknown payment rate from 2.49% in FY 2023 to 0.57% in FY 2024 supports the
      effective implementation and prioritization of action within the agency.
    rnp3: 'The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program prioritized and
      implemented effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of
      rate reductions and projections under the statutory threshold for significant
      improper payments of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from
      FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased
      its improper and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57% (a reduction of 1.92%)
      and improper and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82
      million reduction). In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the
      actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was
      to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within
      the agency. The results for the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program
      indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were effective, two were designed
      effectively, and one was designed ineffectively. If improvements could be made,
      VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies
      to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $23.30 million in FY 2023 to $8.57 million in FY 2024, or
      a 63% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper,
      associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
      reduction in the unknown payment amount from $27.74 million in FY 2023 to $0.73
      million in FY 2024, or a 97% reduction. For errors tied to failure to access
      data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did
      not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024.


      Due to the program successfully reporting an error rate under 1.5% and improper
      payments under $100 million in FY 2024, an effectiveness review will not be
      performed in FY 2025. Management will continue its responsibilities for internal
      control outlined in the Government Accountability Office’s Green Book.'

      that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or not. The agency
      was missing documentation which contained key information that would have enabled
      the agency's ability to discern whether the payment was proper or improper.
      For example, despite having a contract price schedule, the invoice price cannot
      be reconciled to the contract due to lack of detail in the price schedule. For
      this reason, we are unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper
      without that documentation.

      that includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the
      contract price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule
      and/or the vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether
      or not the billed amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives
      an invoice of $1,000 for lease of facility A; however, the contract price schedule
      is $3,000 for "rent" and does not specifically include a line item or rate for
      the billed lease of facility A.  For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether
      the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional
      cost details in the contract price schedule.
    cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation related to invoice pricing that was required to validate whether
      a payment was proper or not. Specifically, the agency was unable to determine
      the appropriate pricing due to the lack information in the contract price schedule.
      Without documentation supporting the appropriate contract rate information,
      the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.
