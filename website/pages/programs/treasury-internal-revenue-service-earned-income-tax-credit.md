  rap6: "The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is\
    \ available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable\
    \ tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design\
    \ and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses,\
    \ financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS\
    \ works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance\
    \ and reduce erroneous payments. \n\nFor  FY 2021 , the Administration included\
    \ the following proposals in its Budget submission:\n\nProvide the IRS with greater\
    \ flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded\
    \ the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases\
    \ where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information\
    \ contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases\
    \ as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer\
    \ has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the\
    \ taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation\
    \ that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal\
    \ would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly\
    \ improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.\n\nIncrease\
    \ Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly\
    \ provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all\
    \ paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid\
    \ tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence\
    \ in the tax system.\n\nFor  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its\
    \ Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal,\
    \ as well as the following additional proposal:\n\nIncrease penalties on ghost\
    \ preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of\
    \ $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer.\
    \ The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty\
    \ may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective\
    \ for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021.\n\n"
  rnp3: The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before
    payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct
    the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools,
    including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent
    the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates
    a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim
    one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers
    make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a disproportionate
    number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of
    other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of
    taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception
    of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness
    to all taxpayers.

    Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional

  rap5: To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
    Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal Year
    2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5 billion
    to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment. If
    the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial
    loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the
    IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to
    audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial
    burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating
    the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such,
    IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is
    a more efficient and cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax
    collections. We further support the reporting of RTC overclaims within the Tax
    Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative
    to the U.S. tax system.
  rap6: 'For FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its
    Budget submission:

    (1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers-

    The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the
    Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal tax
    returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.


    (2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – The proposal
    would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate
    behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers. First, it would increase
    the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless
    or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that do
    not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal would establish new
    penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs)
    and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose
    the use of a paid tax return preparer. Third, the proposal would increase the
    limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s
    identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years. Fourth, the
    proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability
    of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting
    standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.'

    cyp4_1: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to include the lack of a preapproval
      process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are
      accurate, is the primary root cause of EITC improper payments. Specifically,  at
      the time of filing/payment the IRS cannot  readily authenticate eligibility
      for the credit, i.e., whether a claimed child in fact qualifies, meeting the
      many nuances of the Age, Relationship, Residency and Joint Return tests. This
      is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available
      or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer
      income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where
      the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Finally, each year there
      are many taxpayers who claim and receive EITC for the first time, who have to
      understand and apply the complex eligibility requirements. The statutory structure
      and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including EITC,
      prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data prior to making
      a refund.
  rap5: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Earned Income Tax Credit
    (EITC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with
    EITC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around EITC and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff. The Inspector General of Tax Administration (TIGTA) has
    traditionally reported that the issue with improper payments is not an internal
    control deficiency.
  rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
    its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number of
    correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits, including
    the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Focusing on helping taxpayers submit accurate
    filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative burdens
    for the IRS and the tax filer.
  rnp3: The regulatory structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to include
    the lack of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification
    that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of EITC improper payments.
    While the IRS has the ability to identify EITC errors by type, correlating remediation
    efforts to success is challenging. Given its limited authority to directly prevent
    and stop these errors, the IRS focuses on positively influencing taxpayer behavior
    and working with paid preparers and tax preparation software/online filing service
    providers. Further, the IRS has sought legislative authority to enhance verification
    procedures for taxpayers claiming EITC.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
    the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

      refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods
      of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the
      process. As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit
      management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper
      payments are reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and
      the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove
      their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional)
      can occur. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.
      The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas
      in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts
      to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer
      outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits.
      By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that
      delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which
      they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially
      increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Earned
      Income Tax Credit (EITC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next
      filing season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune
      criteria used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from
      prior filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters,
      the IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and
      prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned,
      throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary
      root causes of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) are reliance
      on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval
      process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs
      upfront (as would be the case with a traditional payment program), errors can
      occur due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of
      eligibility. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.
      The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas
      in which errors are most likely to occur.

  act17_1: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
    such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), is the complexity of the credits''
    statutory eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes of RTC improper
    payments are as follows: (1) the lack of a pre-approval process and inability
    to authenticate eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer misrepresentation
    or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility, especially for self-employment
    or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties; and (3) the inability
    for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these root causes, the IRS has
    to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return. The IRS has implemented
    a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating these root causes. The annual
    Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing and adjusting compliance
    filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS to detect errors earlier.
    The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Office of Child Support
    Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would enable the IRS to identify discrepancies
    in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS has invested in taxpayer education and outreach
    efforts, through such venues as the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax
    Fest, to educate tax preparers about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer
    eligibility before filing claims. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further
    its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach
    and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping
    taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds
    and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible,
    the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing
    the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. All of these corrective actions are strategically
    designed to address the root causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy
    of filed returns and mitigating the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
  act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks
    a pre-approval process and causes the IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification
    that their returns claiming RTCs are accurate, is a key factor contributing to
    RTC improper payments. Despite these constraints, the IRS has strategically designed
    corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments by improving
    the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating the risks associated with taxpayer
    self-certification. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions focused

    on the magnitude of the root causes they address and the potential impact of each
    action on reducing improper payments. Data-driven analyses are critical in determining
    which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further
    its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach
    and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping
    taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds
    and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible,
    the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing
    the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. The IRS ensures that its corrective actions
    are continuously monitored, effectively implemented and reprioritized based on
    their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: 'The FY 2025 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2024
    Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments will
    be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited

    authority to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most
    of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors that
    are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies
    on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party sources.
    The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility requirements
    and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments. Error prevention
    and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive examinations
    and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources to audit every
    return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through this process
    are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated for the program.
    Without legislative change to greatly improve effective tools to administer these
    credits, the improper payment rate will not change significantly.'

    cyp4_1: These overpayments include the inability to authenticate data, primarily
      because the data does not exist.  Authentication is difficult because the IRS
      relies primarily on self-reported information from taxpayers, and there is a

  rap5: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
    (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with
    RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Inspector
    General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported that the issue
    with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
    the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.'
  rap6: "The IRS has proposed various legislative changes over the years aimed at\
    \ providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission,\
    \ the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget submission:\
    \ \n\nA. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The\
    \ proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance\
    \ or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.\
    \  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return\
    \ preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as\
    \ for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second,\
    \ the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer\
    \ Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers\
    \ (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. \
    \ Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty\
    \ for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from\
    \ three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s\
    \ authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate\
    \ in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions\
    \ to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\nB. Increase Oversight of\
    \ Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money\
    \ and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all\
    \ paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum\
    \ competency standards. \n\nThese statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors\
    \ to some degree.  However, a meaningful reduction in the estimated error rate\
    \ is unlikely without independent data sources through which the IRS can verify\
    \ taxpayer-provided information and additional time and resources for the IRS\
    \ to address any issues identified."
  rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
    do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
    root causes of the Earned Income Tax Credit improper payments are as follows:
    (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability
    to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
    taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party
    data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on
    taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are
    managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement.
    At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a)
    there''s an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of
    complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing
    with many nuances); (b) there''s instances where taxpayer income is misreported,
    particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported to
    the IRS by a third party; and (c) there''s a turnover of taxpayer who receive
    certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements
    of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not
    have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority.
    However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes a number of filters
    that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules compliance and
    payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data
    sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts aid the Service
    in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of
    outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers
    understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.'
  rnp4: "The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit\
    \ programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.\
    \  The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan\
    \ that addresses erroneous claims.  Each year the IRS updates its strategy using\
    \ the most recent research findings, prior year audit results, TIGTA/GAO audit\
    \ findings and legislative updates.  The IRS also submits legislative proposals\
    \ which, if approved by Congress, may further enhance efforts to address areas\
    \ of risk and reduce improper payments. \n \nThe IRS reviews and updates Internal\
    \ Revenue Manuals throughout the year and ensures that IRS employees who administer\
    \ refundable credits receive annual training and have the requisite knowledge\
    \ to address the evolving nature of improper payments and fraud.  Employees are\
    \ also encouraged to recommend changes that may further strengthen the IRS's internal\
    \ controls and procedures.\n \nThe IRS performance plans also balance the outreach\
    \ and awareness component with its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to\
    \ find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the knowledge of taxpayers\
    \ and paid return preparers of the eligibility and criteria for RTCs."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not been determined.\
    \ It is important to note the Refundable Tax Credits (RTCs) do not have the characteristics\
    \ of a typical payment program. The primary root causes of improper payments of\
    \ RTCs are the inability to authenticate eligibility at return filing because\
    \ the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting related to\
    \ self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported to\
