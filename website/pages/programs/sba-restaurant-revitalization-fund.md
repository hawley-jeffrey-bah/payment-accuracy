    estimates encompassed all disbursements for the program.  There was no funding

    for 53 of the 122 Awards, SBA had collected enough information and completed a
    significant portion of the reviews to be able to identify that an improper payment
    is likely.  For 31 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an Award calculation
    error.  For 20 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an eligibility issue.

  pro1: "The RRF program was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to\
    \ eligible restaurants, bars, and other qualifying businesses as a result of the\
    \ COVID-19 pandemic. In total the program provided 100,745 grants to eligible\
    \ program participants, of which 99.83% of those grants were approved and processed\
    \ between the period May 10, 2021, to June 30, 2021. The remaining disbursements\
    \ were processed between the period April 1, 2022, through March 31, 2023. The\
    \ SBA leverages separate sampling and estimation methodologies for each of the\
    \ distinct RRF disbursement periods and combines the results of the two estimates\
    \ to derive improper and unknown payment estimates for the program.\n\nFor RRF\
    \ grant reviews, sample cases were chosen using PPS Sampling with replacement\
    \ from all disbursements during the period May 10, 2021, through June 30, 2021.\
    \ This population was divided into five strata based on their review tier. The\
    \ SBA determined the appropriate total sample size to be 384 awards from this\
    \ population. Additionally, a census sample was drawn for all disbursements during\
    \ the period April 1, 2022, through March 31, 2023. The combined samples included\
    \ aggregate outlays of $461,969,300 and an absolute value of improper payments\
    \ of $71,708 within the samples. \n\nBecause the improper and unknown payments\
    \ were calculated from FY2022 and FY2023 rates and estimates, the program’s rates\
    \ listed here apply to FY2022 and FY2023, and do not apply to FY2024.  The estimated\
    \ program improper payment rate for the RRF grant population is 0.0003 percent.\
    \  The program’s Unknown payment rate for the period was 30.32 percent. At the\
    \ time of this writing, the SBA had not completed its review of 122 awards of\
    \ the 384 awards in the sample of awards originated in FY2021. However, for 53\
    \ of the 122 Awards, SBA had collected enough information and completed a significant\
    \ portion of the reviews to be able to identify that an improper payment is likely.\
    \  For 31 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an Award calculation error.\
    \  For 20 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an eligibility issue.   SBA\
    \ does not see intent on the part of the Awardees to commit fraud for these 51\
    \ Awards.  In conducting these Post Award Reviews, SBA has only seen an indication\
    \ of potential fraud in 4 Awards.\n\nThe RRF program ended on June 30, 2021. \
    \ FY 2024 improper payment rate estimates encompassed all disbursements for the\
    \ program.  There was no funding for this program in FY2024, no disbursements\
    \ will be made in FY2025, and therefore no improper payment rates will be extrapolated.\n"
  rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure.
  rap6: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission
    of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: This program ended in June 2021.  No additional RRF disbursements were made
    in FY2024, and none will be made in FY2025.  As such, SBA has not established
    a corrective action plan specific to this program.
  rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
    process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable reduction
    targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and recovering overpayments.  Nevertheless,
    this program ended in June 2021.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The RRF program ended on June 30, 2021.  FY 2024 improper payment rate estimates
    encompassed all disbursements for the program.  There was no funding for this
    program in FY2024, no disbursements will be made in FY2025, and therefore no improper
    payment rates will be extrapolated.  Further, SBA has not set a reduction target
    or a tolerable rate range, as this program has ended.
