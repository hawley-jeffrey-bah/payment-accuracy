  pro1: Head Start was determined to be risk-susceptible in FY 2021. As with other
    programs, developing and implementing a new improper payment estimation methodology
    and process can be a time-intensive process.  HHS is developing an improper payment
    measurement and expects to report an error rate for this program in FY 2023.

      actions taken by HHS include working with grant recipients in areas such as
      procurement, source documentation, cost allocation, allowability of cost and

    Description_Action_Taken: HHS plans to provide ongoing training to recipients
      on the issues that caused payment errors in the Head Start program.  Training
      will be conducted in areas such as procurement, source documentation, cost allocation,
      allowability of cost and other common fiscal challenges that lead to payment
      errors.  HHS also plans to issue Information Memorandum and Program Instructions
      as needed to ensure fiscal and program integrity.    In addition, targeted technical
      assistance will be provided to individual recipients to address their specific
      error causes.  Further, HHS plans to take recovery action on payment errors
      identified during improper payment reviews and continue to issue disallowances
      on errors discovered through HHS Office of Inspector General audits, HHS program
      reviews, and Single Audits.

  cyp7_ucp1_1: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head
    Start recipient failed to provide.  In one instance, the limitation was imposed
    because of an active fraud investigation, which prevented HHS from obtaining any
    information from the recipient.  In the other instance, the Head Start recipient
    did not provide transaction level detail to support expenditures.  Therefore,
    HHS could not determine the nature of the individual expenditures or the documentation
    required.
  cyp7_ucp2_1: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head

  cyp7_ucp3_1: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head
    Start recipient failed to provide.  In one instance, the limitation was imposed
    because the Head Start recipient is the subject of an active fraud investigation,
    which prevented HHS from obtaining any information from the recipient.  In the
    other instance, the Head Start recipient did not provide transaction level detail
    to support expenditures therefore, HHS could not determine the nature of the individual
    expenditures or the documentation required.  In both scenarios, HHS is unable
    to determine if the payment is proper or improper without the documentation to
    conclude if the expenditures qualified as an allowable use of funds under the
    Head Start program.
  cyp7_ucp4_1: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head
    Start recipient failed to provide.  In one instance, the limitation was imposed
    because the Head Start recipient is the subject of an active fraud investigation,

    to determine if the payment is proper or improper without the documentation to
    conclude if the expenditures qualified as allowable use of funds under the Head
    Start program.
  cyp8: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of the
    HHS review, the available documentation was not sufficient to determine if the
    payments were proper or improper.  There were two Head Start recipients that fell
    into this category.  In one instance, the Head Start recipient was the subject
    of an active fraud investigation and thus could not be tested.  In the other instance,
    the Head Start recipient failed to provide sufficient documentation at the level
    of detail necessary to conduct the review.

    cyp4_1: Overpayments are outside of HHS's control for the Head Start program because
      pre-approval of individual expenditures is not required.   Funds are awarded
      to recipients who then disburse the funds within the parameters of approved
      budget categories.  Periodically, recipients submit financial reports summarizing
      the cash transactions made for its federal award.  Detail transaction level
      data is not submitted to HHS pre or post payment unless specifically requested
      by HHS in special circumstances, and  even then, is limited to specific funding
      recipients and not across all recipients and/or payments.
  pro1: HHS annually awards over $10 billion in federal grants to approximately 2,100
    funding recipients for the Head Start program.  HHS is committed to ensuring the
    most vulnerable families benefit from enrollment in the Head Start program.  To
    accomplish this, HHS strives to identify strategies to strengthen our monitoring
    and oversight of the Head Start program to ensure that funds are used for their
    intended and allowable purposes.
  rap5: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this
    is the first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown Payment
    estimate for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates determining
    a tolerable rate in the future once more performance data is available.  Once
    HHS establishes a baseline and develops a tolerable rate for the Head Start program,
    we can assess needs with respect to internal controls, human capital and information
    systems and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown payments
    to a determined tolerable rate.
  rap6: HHS did not request resources in the most recent budget submission of the
    agency specific to establishing and maintaining controls in the Head Start program
    to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.  HHS
    has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this is the
    first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown Payment estimate
    for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates determining a tolerable
    rate in the future once more performance data is available.  Once HHS develops
    a tolerable rate for the Head Start program, we will assess resource needs to
    reduce improper payments and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate,
    and include in the HHS budget submission if warranted.
  rnp3: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper Payments
    and Unknown Payments because they focus on the specific errors identified during
    the review.  Targeted technical assistance is provided to address the underlying
    causes of the errors, along with follow-up action to ensure that corrective action
    was taken to address the root cause of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments
    in the Head Start program.  Based on our initial assessment, these actions are
    deemed proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root
    cause since the Improper Payments error rate for the Head Start program is 1.83%
    and the Unknown Payments error rate is 3.28%, resulting in an overall error rate
    of 5.10%, which is below the statutory threshold of 10%.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this

      program. Training will be conducted in areas such as procurement, source documentation,
      cost allocation, allowability of cost and other common fiscal challenges that
      lead to payment errors. HHS also plans to conduct improper payment training
      to ensure Head Start funding recipients and sub-recipients understand the purposes,
      processes, and expectations around payment integrity.  In addition, HHS plans
      to conduct training specific to financial record keeping, sharing comprehensive
      and practical approaches to financial records management.

  act17_1: HHS's planned and completed actions are focused on the causes of the Improper
    Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because they are based
    on the specific errors identified during the improper payment review.  Targeted
    technical assistance will be provided to Head Start funding recipients to address
    the underlying causes of the errors.  Further, the corrective actions are focused
    not only on specific errors identified at the Head Start funding recipient level,
    but also on policies, procedures, and processes at the Federal level to support
    Head Start funding recipients.
  act17_2: HHS's corrective actions for the Head Start program are adequate because
    they not only focus on the specific errors identified during the improper payment
    review, but will also evaluate policies, processes, and procedures that could
    lead to improper payments. Corrective actions will also address not only areas
    warranting improvement at the Head Start funding recipient level, but also at
    the HHS level.  HHS also plans to monitor the implementation and interim effectiveness
    of the corrective actions to determine if the corrective actions are adequate
    and having the desired effect or if additional corrective actions are warranted.
  act17_3: HHS will effectively implement and prioritize planned actions to focus
    on the cause of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program.  HHS
    will provide targeted technical assistance to Head Start funding recipients to
    address the causes of the identified errors. HHS will also issue Information Memorandum
    and Program Instructions as needed to ensure fiscal and program integrity. In
    addition, HHS will follow-up with individual Head Start funding recipients to
    ensure that corrective action was taken to address the identified error causes.
    HHS is also designating an official who will be accountable for the progress of
    HHS reducing Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program.
    While HHS cannot immediately determine if the planned corrective actions are reducing
    Improper Payments and Unknown Payments, HHS plans to monitor the implementation
    and interim effectiveness of the corrective actions and enhance the corrective
    actions as deemed necessary.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The reduction target is equal to the estimated future Improper Payment
    and Unknown Payment rate for the Head Start program because the reported Improper
    Payment and Unknown Payment rate exceeded the statutory threshold.  Therefore,
    HHS is taking aggressive action and set a goal to reduce the Head Start Improper
    Payment and Unknown Payment rate below the statutory threshold.

  cyp6_1: The causes of the technically improper payments in the Head Start program
    were primarily accounting related errors and missing required documentation in
    the records of the sampled Head Start funding recipients.  In several instances,
    payments were made from the incorrect account at the time of payment for which
    the allocation was corrected in a subsequent period.  Additionally, while the
    validity of some payments could be determined, all of the required supporting
    documentation was not maintained in the financial records.

    or improper without the documentation to conclude if the expenditures qualified
    as an allowable use of funds under the Head Start program.
  cyp8: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of the
    HHS review, the available documentation was not available or sufficient to determine
    if the payments were proper or improper. For two large Head Start funding recipients
    selected for testing, the Head Start funding recipients were unable to provide
    sufficient documentation at the level of detail necessary to conduct the review.
    In other instances, the documentation provided was insufficient to support the
    calculations related to the payments.

    not expect the rate to be over 10% for the Head Start program in FY 2025.  HHS
    is putting a number of mitigation strategies in place to support stronger internal
    processes to support this goal, including securing consultant services to conduct
    a review of current processes, enhancing training and technical assistance for
    grantees, and strengthening current oversight. Since the Improper Payments and
    Unknown Payments error rate for the Head Start program is based on a one-year
    look back, HHS believes that the corrective actions implemented in FY 2024 will
    be reflected in the FY 2025 results.
  rap5: HHS has not determined if they have in place what is needed with respect to
    internal controls, human capital, information systems, and other infrastructure
    to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate for the
    Head Start program.   HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start
    program as this is the second year for calculating and reporting an Improper and
    Unknown Payment estimate for the Head Start program under a new methodology.  HHS
    anticipates determining a tolerable rate in the future once more performance data
    is available.
  rap6: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees request
    an increase for the Head Start program to support funding to stabilize their workforce
    through increased wages and benefits.  Qualified staff are leaving Head Start
    for better paying jobs, including in public school settings and in different sectors
    such as retail and hospitality. The staffing crisis is due to a confluence of
    factors, including persistently low and stagnant wages, particularly for frontline
    staff, lack of comprehensive benefits, and insufficient supports for staff health
    and wellness. This Budget request provides $543.7 million to account for a full
    Cost of Living Adjustment to support Head Start programs to keep pace with inflation.
    The lack of qualified staff is a contributing factor to limited understanding
    of financial and programmatic policies, processes, and procedures, which leads
    to an increase in the likelihood of improper and unknown payments.
  rnp3: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper Payments
    and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because they not only focus on
    the specific errors identified during the improper payment review, but will also
    evaluate policies, processes, and procedures that could lead to improper payments.
    Targeted technical assistance will be provided to Head Start funding recipients
    to address the underlying causes of the errors. Planned corrective actions will
    also address not only areas warranting improvement at the Head Start funding recipient
    level, but also at the HHS level.  HHS also plans to monitor the implementation
    and interim effectiveness of the corrective actions to determine if additional
    corrective actions are warranted.  HHS's planned actions are proportional to the
    severity of the associated amount and rate of the root causes of errors in the
    Head Start program as they are based on the root causes of errors at both the
    recipient and federal level.
  rnp4: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with the
    requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
    Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
    Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this annual
    assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control and Risk
    Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable office.
    Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement which represents
    the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to the overall adequacy
    and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating Division related
    to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal entities that
    receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes, and non-profit
    organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single Audit Act of
    1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative Requirements,
    Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that was in effect
    during 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities that expend $750,000
    or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal year. With the
    Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released revisions to the Uniform
    Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective October 01, 2024. In
    addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities, overpayments
    are identified and recovered through Single Audits and HHS Office of Inspector
    General audits. Foreach of the aforementioned activities, recipients are subject
    to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with program regulations.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as this
    is the second year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown Payment
    estimate for the Head Start program under a new methodology.  The wide variance
    between the FY 2023 Improper Payments and Unknown Payments rate of 5.10% compared
    to the FY 2024 Improper Payments and Unknown Payments rate of 11.98% is indicative
    that HHS does not have sufficient data to determine a tolerable rate for the Head
    Start program.  HHS anticipates determining a tolerable rate in the future once
    more performance data is available.
