  rap6: "The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is\
    \ available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable\
    \ tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design\
    \ and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses,\
    \ financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS\
    \ works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance\
    \ and reduce erroneous payments. \n\nFor  FY 2021 , the Administration included\
    \ the following proposals in its Budget submission:\n\nProvide the IRS with greater\
    \ flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded\
    \ the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases\
    \ where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information\
    \ contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases\
    \ as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer\
    \ has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the\
    \ taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation\
    \ that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal\
    \ would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly\
    \ improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.\n\nIncrease\
    \ Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly\
    \ provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all\
    \ paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid\
    \ tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence\
    \ in the tax system.\n\nFor  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its\
    \ Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal,\
    \ as well as the following additional proposal:\n\nIncrease penalties on ghost\
    \ preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of\
    \ $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer.\
    \ The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty\
    \ may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective\
    \ for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021."
  rnp3: The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before
    payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and correct
    the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement tools,
    including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then prevent
    the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the IRS allocates
    a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit returns that claim
    one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because lower-income taxpayers
    make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are subjected to a disproportionate
    number of audits (RTC claimants are audited at almost three times the rate of
    other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers make up a significant portion of
    taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers can lead to a negative perception
    of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness
    to all taxpayers.

  rap5: "To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity\
    \ Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal\
    \ Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5\
    \ billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment.\
    \ If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA,\
    \ a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would\
    \ result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and\
    \ tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions\
    \ would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits\
    \ and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law\
    \ with integrity and fairness. \n\nAs such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement\
    \ resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to\
    \ minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We further support the reporting\
    \ of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS\
    \ approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system."
  rap6: "For  FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its\

    \ Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal\
    \ tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.\n\
     \n(2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – \n\
    The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance\
    \ or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.\
    \ First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers\
    \ for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms\
    \ of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal\
    \ would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification\
    \ Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\nNumbers (EFINs) and for\
    \ failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. Third, the proposal\
    \ would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure\
    \ to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years\
    \ to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify the\nSecretary’s authority\

    Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments will
    be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited

    authority to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most
    of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors that
    are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies
    on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party

    sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility
    requirements and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments.
    Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive
    examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources
    to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through
    this process are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated for

    cyp4_1: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), to include the lack of
      a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax
      returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of ACTC improper payments. Specifically,
      at the time of filing/payment the IRS cannot readily authenticate eligibility
      for the credit, i.e., whether a claimed child in fact qualifies, meeting the
      many nuances of the Age, Relationship, Residency and Joint Return Tests. This
      is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available
      or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer
      income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where
      the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Finally,  each year
      there are many taxpayers who claim and receive ACTC for the first time, who
      have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and
      design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including ACTC, prevents
      the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a
      refund.
  pro1: "The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) included a one-time, one-year\
    \ amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, expanding the existing Child\
    \ Tax Credit (CTC) laws for tax year 2021, which provided Child Tax Credit Improvements\
    \ for Tax Year (TY) 2021 (TY 2021 CTC). Total claimed under this new CTC was $125.9\
    \ billion which includes advanced payments totaling $92.7 billion to eligible\
    \ taxpayers from July to December 2021.\n \nTY 2021 CTC is structured and processed\
    \ differently than any previous non-refundable CTC, as eligible taxpayers automatically\
    \ received advance payments (unless they opted-out) and later had to reconcile\
    \ the credit on their 2021 tax returns. Eligibility and other criteria for ACTC\
    \ also changed significantly. TY 2021 CTC was designed and implemented as part\
    \ of the COVID-19 assistance programs; thus, the credit is similarly temporary\
    \ in nature and has no basis for future improper payment estimates. \n \nTo estimate\
    \ improper payment rates for refundable tax credits, the IRS must perform comprehensive\
    \ audits over a large sample of tax returns. Given the statutory timelines, IRS\
    \ needs a minimum of three years to calculate an estimated improper payment rate,\
    \ long after the TY 2021 CTC has ended.\n"
  rap5: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Additional Child Tax
    Credit (ACTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The
    issue with ACTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around ACTC and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff.
  rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
    its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number of
    correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits, including
    the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). Focusing on helping taxpayers submit accurate
    filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative burdens
    for the IRS and the tax filer.
  rnp3: The IRS has the ability to identify Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) errors
    by type. Correlating remediation efforts to success is challenging. Given its
    limited authority to directly prevent and stop these errors, the IRS focuses on
    positively influencing taxpayer behavior and working with paid preparers and tax
    preparation software/online filing service providers. Further, the IRS has sought
    legislative authority to enhance verification procedures for taxpayers claiming
    ACTC and penalties for individuals or entities found guilty of abusing RTCs. Taxpayer
    education and outreach efforts, such as the IRS's annual Dependent Database (DDb)
    meetings, inform taxpayers about program eligibility requirements.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: "Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.\
    \ Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Additional
      Child Tax Credit (ACTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next filing
      season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune criteria
      used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from prior
      filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters, the
      IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. Due to the taxpayer’s
      misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility requirements,
      especially for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties,
      and reliance on taxpayer self-certification, errors (both unintentional and
      intentional) can occur. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting helps to

      inability to access data/information at the time the return is filed. Improved
      compliance filters can identify non-compliance issues after returns are filed
      but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary
      result of this effort enhances allocating resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Cross Enterprise Sharing
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements
      with the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and the Social Security
      Administration (SSA) to access critical information that aids in validating
      eligibility for the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). This data-sharing involves
      the exchange of key data points, such as income verification, household composition
      and income limits and the eligibility to claim certain dependents. With this
      information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers meet the eligibility
      requirements for the ACTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing allows the IRS to detect
      discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as misreported income or invalid dependent
      claims, and prevent improper payments during the return processing stage. Another
      root cause of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) is taxpayer
      misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility requirements. Given that RTCs
      rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information, taxpayers may inaccurately
      claim the ACTC due to misunderstanding income limits or dependency. By leveraging
      third-party data sources from OCSE and SSA, the IRS can verify key elements
      of returns. This is especially important given the lack of a pre-approval process
      for these credits. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic
      initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education,
      in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file
      accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring
      taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the
      IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the
      burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Action_Type: Change Process
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and IT divisions, to review and adjust the value of prior-year compliance
      filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Additional Child Tax Credit
      (ACTC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters
      to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. The annual Dependent
      Database (DDb) meeting helps to mitigate the refundable tax credits (RTCs) improper
      payment primary root causes (1) data/information needed does not exist at the
      point of return filing and (2) inability to access data/information at the time
      the return is filed. Due to the taxpayer’s misrepresentation or misunderstanding
      of key points of eligibility requirements, especially for self-employment or
      other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties, and reliance on taxpayer
      self-certification, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved
      compliance filters can enhance these issues after returns are filed but before
      payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result
      of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur.

    such as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), is the complexity of the credits''
    statutory eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes of RTC improper
    payments are as follows: (1) the lack of a pre-approval process and inability
    to authenticate eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer misrepresentation
    or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility, especially for self-employment
    or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties; and (3) the inability
    for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these root causes, the IRS has
    to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return. The IRS has implemented
    a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating these root causes. The annual
    Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing and adjusting compliance
    filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS to detect errors earlier.
    The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Office of Child Support
    Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would enable the IRS to identify discrepancies
    in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS has invested in taxpayer education and outreach
    efforts, through such venues as the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax
    Fest, to educate tax preparers about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer
    eligibility before filing claims. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further
    its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach
    and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping
    taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds
    and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible,
    the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing
    the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. All of these corrective actions are strategically
    designed to address the root causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy
    of filed returns and mitigating the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
  act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), such as the
    Additional Child Tax Credit, which lacks a pre-approval process and causes the
    IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification that their returns claiming
    RTCs are accurate, is a key factor contributing to RTC improper payments. Despite
    these constraints, the IRS has strategically designed corrective actions to address
    the root causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns
    and mitigating the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification. The IRS

    on the magnitude of the root causes they address and the potential impact of each
    action on reducing improper payments. Data-driven analyses are critical in determining
    which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further
    its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach
    and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping
    taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds
    and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible,
    the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing
    the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. The IRS ensures that its corrective actions
    are continuously monitored, effectively implemented and reprioritized based on
    their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: 'The FY 2025 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2024
    Improper Payment Rate for the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The unique nature
    of tax administration means that traditional target-setting as a means of approaching
    reductions in refundable tax credit (RTC) improper payments will be ineffective.
    The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited authority to make changes to the
    claims during return processing. More so, most of the eligibility and

    credit determination requirements depends on factors that are generally not known
    by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies on taxpayer-provided
    information without verifiability by third-party sources. The complexity of the
    law contributes to confusion around eligibility requirements and is one of

    the major contributing factors of improper payments. Error prevention and recoveries
    are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive examinations and other
    compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources to audit every return claiming
    RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through this process are small relative
    to the amount of improper payments estimated for the program. Without legislative
    change to greatly improve effective tools to administer these credits, the improper
    payment rate will not change significantly.'

    cyp4_1: The overpayments outside of the agency control include the inability to
      authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      also include the inability to authenticate data due to program design limitations.
      Barriers caused by program design occur when information needed to confirm payment
      accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed.
  rap5: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
    (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with
    RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Inspector
    General of Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported that the issue
    with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
  rap6: "Further improving the integrity of RTC programs will take actions beyond\
    \ the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) control. The IRS has proposed various\
    \ legislative changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for\
    \ managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included\
    \ the following proposals in its Budget submission: \n\n1. Expand and increase\
    \ Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal would increase\
    \ and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior\
    \ by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would increase\
    \ the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless\
    \ or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance that\
    \ do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish\
    \ new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs)\
    \ and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose\
    \ the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal would increase the\
    \ limitations period during which the penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s\
    \ identifying number may be assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the\
    \ proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and\
    \ suitability of persons who participate in the authorized e-file program, including\
    \ setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file\
    \ program.  \n\n2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal\
    \ would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary\
    \ with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns,\
    \ including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese\
    \ statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
    \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data sources\
    \ through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and additional\
    \ time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
  rnp3: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs), such
    as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), is the complexity of the credits''
    statutory eligibility requirements.  The fundamental root causes of the Additional
    Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack
    of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments
    (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility
    belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available
    at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification
    that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within and follow the
    regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower level, the
    root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there is an inability
    to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility
    rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing many nuances); (b)
    there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related
    to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third
    party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayer who receive certain credits for the
    first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the credit.
    Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability to
    deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the IRS''s
    information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS uses
    to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility rules and payment certification.
    The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing with
    other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts aid the IRS in mitigating
    the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of outreach and
    education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers understand the
    program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.'
  rnp4: "The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit\
    \ programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.\
    \  The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan\
    \ that addresses erroneous claims.  Each year the IRS updates its strategy using\
    \ the most recent research findings, prior year audit results, TIGTA/GAO audit\
    \ findings and legislative updates.  The IRS also submits legislative proposals\
    \ which, if approved by Congress, may further enhance efforts to address areas\
    \ of risk and reduce improper payments. \n \nThe IRS reviews and updates Internal\
    \ Revenue Manuals throughout the year and ensures that IRS employees who administer\
    \ refundable credits receive annual training and have the requisite knowledge\
    \ to address the evolving nature of improper payments and fraud.  Employees are\
    \ also encouraged to recommend changes that may further strengthen the IRS's internal\
    \ controls and procedures.\n \nThe IRS performance plans also balance the outreach\
    \ and awareness component with its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to\
    \ find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the knowledge of taxpayers\
    \ and paid return preparers of the eligibility and criteria for RTCs.\n\nReducing\
    \ the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
    \ restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not yet been\
    \ determined. It is important to note the Refundable Tax Credits (RTCs) do not\
    \ have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The primary root causes\
    \ of improper payments of RTCs are the inability to authenticate eligibility at\
    \ return filing because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting\
    \ related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported\
    \ to the IRS by a third party. Put simply, payment eligibility and certification\
    \ decisions for RTCs are made by the taxpayer during the filing process. \n\n\
    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
    \ restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,\
    \ the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate."
