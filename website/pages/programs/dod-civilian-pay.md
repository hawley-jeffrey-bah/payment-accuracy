    The Department has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
    payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  Moreover,
    Federal Civilian Pay Services, which support the end-to-end delivery of payroll
    processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational Control

    (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2021.


    Human Capital:

    The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the
    Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.  However, as the
    Civilian Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
    and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


    Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

    The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to
    reduce improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department
    has targeted.  The primary system currently used by the Department to process
    Civilian Pay is the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS).  The general and application
    controls of DCPS were included in the scope of the Federal Civilian Pay Services
    FY 2021 Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 examination,
    which received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2
    report.  Additionally, the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System, which provides
    employment verification information, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report
    under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2021.  Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the
    Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are
    the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified SOC
    1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2021.  As technology advances, the Department
    continues to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian Pay through implementation
    of new payroll and entitlement processing systems and enhancements to existing
    systems.

  rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department
    can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently
    in Phase II. The DoD OIG concluded that the previous Department estimates were
    unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable which led to
    insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull
    the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department has since
    implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
    for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans,
    created a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
    of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
    Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved
    by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes
    by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and
    process will produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the Department’s
    efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
    the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD OIG
    confirmed reliable estimates; the Department will be able to establish effective
    and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Army Civilian Field Offices were unable to provide
      complete SF 1190s with authorizing signatures. Addressing the root causes for
      the samples determined Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that
      combined is above the statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan
      (CAP) is a combination of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions
      aimed at reducing the likelihood of Technically Improper or Unknown Payment
      errors occurring during the payment process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army
      Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian
      pay personnel offices to ensure that block 25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation
      of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army
      Command partners. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly
      coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue
      to review the requirements that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting
      existing SF 1190s), and will coordinate with our Command partners appropriately.


      An additional Department CAP has been created specifically for Department of
      Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard
      Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  Completion
      of the SF-1190 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount
      for all overseas allowances.  During the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 audit, the SF-1190
      was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found that the SF-1190 did not have
      consistent signatures and dates on the standard forms. DoDEA is in the process
      of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System
      (DAPS) which is to be housed on their internal ServiceNow network. With the
      upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled signatures and dates.'

      the lack of or inability to provide adequate key supporting documentation for
      disbursements from samples selected during post pay review of the program.  The
      error reason for the majority of the civilian payments was that the SF 1190s

    and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Civilian
    Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. The primary system currently
    used by the Department to process Civilian Pay is the Defense Civilian Pay System
    (DCPS). The general and application controls of DCPS were included in the scope
    of the Federal Civilian Pay Services fiscal year (FY) 2023 SSAE No. 18 examination,
    which received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report. Additionally, the Defense Civilian
    Personnel Data System, which provides employment verification information, received
    an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. Moreover, the
    Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable
    Disbursing System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department,
    received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. As technology
    advances, the Department continues to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian
    Pay through implementation of new payroll and entitlement processing systems and

    enhancements to existing systems.'
  rap6: The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) has requested resources
    during the most recent budget submission to provide a system modernization to
    DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS). The modernization will allow the system
    to become audit compliant with information technology regulations as well as audit
    policies and procedures related to the review and approval of SF1190s. DoDEA has
    multiple audits each year and a Resource Management (RM) Financial Analysis Branch
    (FAB) and Strategic and Excellence (SOE) Risk Management Internal Control (RMIC)
    Program which reviews internal controls to ensure DoDEA's compliance with laws,
    regulations, policies, and procedures.
  rnp3: "Army Civilian Field Offices were unable to provide complete SF 1190s with\
    \ authorizing signatures. Addressing the root causes for the samples determined\
    \ Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that combined is above the\
    \ statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is a combination\
    \ of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions aimed at reducing the likelihood\
    \ of Technically Improper and Unknown Payment errors occurring during the payment\
    \ process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA)\
    \ provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that block\
    \ 25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block\
    \ 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army Command partners. Any SF 1190s that\
    \ are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands\
    \ to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review the requirements\
    \ that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting existing SF 1190s),\
    \ and will coordinate with Army Command partners appropriately.\n\nA DoDEA employee\
    \ must complete a Standard Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and\
    \ payment for overseas allowances.  Completion of the SF-1190 provides the necessary\
    \ information to determine the correct amount for all overseas allowances.  During\
    \ the FY2023 audit, the SF-1190 was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found\
    \ that the SF-1190 did not have consistent signatures and dates on the standard\
    \ forms. DoDEA is in the process of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA\
    \ Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be housed on DoDEA's internal\
    \ ServiceNow network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled\
    \ signatures and dates. \n\nThe Department has a strong and overall highly effective\
    \ and refined CAP process that has a proven track record of reducing improper\
    \ and unknown payments which is further evidenced by the DoD OIG awarding PIIA\
    \ Compliance specific to the Department's published CAPs."
