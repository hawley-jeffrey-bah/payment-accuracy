    \ processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only\
    \ make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation\
    \ at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\nFarm Service Agency will\
    \ require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal\
    \ controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting\
    \ more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   \n\
    \nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve\
    \ the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity\
    \ and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional\
    \ compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive\
    \ and robust compliance program.  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions\
    \ whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related\
    \ issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer,\
    \ but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency\
    \ to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability\
    \ and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
    \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal\
    \ controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are\
    \ still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity\
    \ to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
    \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating\
    \ the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency\
    \ program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues\
    \ to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering\
    \ Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers\
    \ duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties.\
    \ Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing\
    \ a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal\
    \ year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.\n\nInformation\
    \ Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive\
    \ measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to\
    \ reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance;\
    \ therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal\
    \ controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance\
    \ of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning\
    \ to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software\
    \ to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster\
    \ programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative\
    \ entries and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software\
    \ “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the\
    \ increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current\
    \ deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems.\
    \ \n\nFrom an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has\
    \ invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues\
    \ to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
    \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
    \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
    \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
    \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned\
    \ through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s\
    \ new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions\
    \ to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to:\
    \ 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical,\
    \ survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling”\
    \ and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are\
    \ delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a\
    \ risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified\
    \ to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics\
    \ that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating\
    \ a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators,\
    \ anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment\
    \ of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation\
    \ of authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
    \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and\
    \ determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm\
    \ Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling\
    \ of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval\
    \ and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and\
    \ the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency,\
    \ data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant\
    \ investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations\
    \ have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase\
    \ transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to\
    \ support important mission-focused decision-making.  \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm\
    \ Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program\
    \ 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity\
    \ Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss\
    \ Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio,\
    \ Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.\
    \  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity,\

  rnp3: Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s historical top errors are related
    to acreage reporting and production records. The errors typically occur when county
    office employees fail to access data, fail to enter data, or enter it incorrectly,
    such as data from the National Crop Table, or data entered on CCC-576 (Appraisal
    and Production form). The agency's Safety Net Division has addressed these errors
    through training, such as National training in Phoenix (August 2019), and Noninsured
    Crop Disaster Assistance Program's monthly calls with State office program specialists.
    These trainings are posted on Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs' internal
    training page and available to all Farm Service Agency employees. As a result,
    the programs improper payment error rate has decreased the past four consecutive
    years and is now below ten percent.

      a combination of, harvested, appraised, and assigned production of a crop within
      a county, which may also include production from multiple farms with multiple
      fields. If one of the three types are determined incorrectly, the sum of the
      three will be incorrect, leading to an improper payment.  Training on how to
      determine production was provided in January 2023 in Dallas TX.'

  act17_1: "The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements of\
    \ program not met.  To address these findings, Safety Net Division established\
    \ a Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program task force in 2024 primarily consisting\
    \ of State and county office Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program specialists\
    \ for comments and to discuss Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s findings\
    \ and policy challenges and suggest possible policy improvements. The task force\
    \ met in Kansas City from February 5-9, 2024, and virtually throughout the spring\
    \ of 2024. Based on their findings, amendments to policy were presented at national\
    \ training during the week of July 15, 2024. \n\nAt the same time, Safety Net\
    \ Division established an acreage reporting task force consisting of State and\
    \ county office Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program specialists to discuss\
    \ issues, findings, and suggest solutions relating to acreage reporting. The outcome\
    \ was 2-CP amendment 28 issued on April 12, 2024. The above corrective actions\
    \ are focused on the cause of the improper payments. \n"
  act17_2: "The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements of\
    \ program not met.  Proof that corrective actions such as training and awareness\
    \ have had a positive impact is that Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s\
    \ Statutory Requirements Not Being Met category was reduced in Fiscal Year 2024\
    \ by 42% percent compared to Fiscal Year 2023. \n\nOverall, Noninsured Crop Disaster\
    \ Assistance Program’s improper payment percentage has remained between 9-11 percent\
    \ for the last three years which included many pandemic related ad hoc programs\
    \ which were being administered during this time by the same people administering\
    \ Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. The above corrective actions are\
    \ adequate to address the cause of the improper payments. \n"
  act17_3: 'Actions taken to reduce Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s
    improper payment percentage has been effective. The 2014 Farm Bill had policy
    changes for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program including multiple coverage
    levels. Policy, forms, and program automation had to be developed to accommodate
    the new legislation. In Fiscal Year 2019, Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance
    Program’s improper payment percentage increased to 23 percent. Safety Net Division
    began a concentrated effort to reduce Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s
    improper percentage and in Fiscal Year 2022, Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance
    Program’s improper payment percentage was reduced to 9.47 percent. Noninsured
    Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s improper payment percentage has increased one
    percent in each of the last two fiscal years in part due to increased participation
    in Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, and a lack of funding for software
    enhancements.


    Actions taken included developing payment software to calculate the multiple coverage
    level options, updating the CCC-NAP 770 and requiring it to be completed with
    a second party review prior to a payment being disbursed became a policy requirement.
    Also, Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program monthly calls were established,
    and improper payment awareness was increased. All contributed to reducing Noninsured
    Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s improper payment percentage. These corrective
    actions will be effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency to reduce
    improper payments.

    '
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: With the implementation of the current corrective actions and the planned
    corrective actions for the program, it is the agency’s anticipation that the projected
    reduction target will be less than the estimated future improper payment rate.

  cyp6_1: "Incorrect grazing acres and production accounting errors were the two primary\
    \ findings that contributed to statutory requirements not being met.  1) Various\
    \ grazing information such as animal units are manually entered in the Grass for\
    \ Grazing worksheet, which is a customized excel spreadsheet that converts the\
    \ information into acres. If for example, animal units are determined incorrectly,\
    \ or the data is erroneously entered in the worksheet or payment software, the\
    \ payment amount will be incorrect.  This manual process has been identified as\
    \ a software enhancement to automate the process preventing many of these specific\
    \ data entry errors. However, the resources have not been available.  2) Production\
    \ accounting may include, or be a combination of, harvested, appraised, and assigned\
    \ production of a crop within a county, which may also include production from\
    \ multiple farms with multiple fields. If one of the three types are determined\
    \ incorrectly, the sum of the three will be incorrect, leading to an improper\
    \ payment. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program task force formed in\
    \ the spring of 2024, suggested policy improvements to reduce findings associated\
    \ with calculating production. One example is removing the requirement that all\
    \ production must be verifiable or reliable. Policy has been amended to give the\
    \ County Office Committee the authority to determine if production submitted is\
    \ reasonable. \n\n7 U.S. Code §7333 (d) specifies acres and yield, and (e) production,\
    \ are part of the calculation for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance payments\
    \ for yield-based crops.\n"

  rap5: A tolerable rate for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program has not been
    established however, the Agency is in the process of establishing additional internal
    controls for its permanent programs such as Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance
    Program. For example, Farm Service Agency is in the process of establishing a
    monitoring system to assure that county offices review payments before being issued.
    The system also has an accountability component to identify offices that struggle
    to disburse proper payments. Once implemented, Farm Service Agency will be in
    a position to determine a tolerable rate based on established data.
  rap6: In order to reduce Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s improper
    payments, system enhancements and training for staff is required however, Farm
    Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to implement
    the requested enhancements.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit
    Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit
    Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills.  Estimated
    funding requirements for system enhancement is $2 million.
  rnp3: Incorrect acreage reporting and production accounting have been perennial
    findings for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. Accurate accounting
    can be complex when producers have multiple fields, and especially in multiple
    counties, or when determined animal units are converted to acres. While training
    has kept these findings from increasing, automation enhancements are needed to
    assure that acres are not missed, and animal units are converted correctly; however,
    funding has not been available. In the meantime, current payment software has
    hard stops or warning boxes to alert users when data is missing, or procedures
    are not being followed. Specific national training has been given as recently
    as July 15-19, 2024. All trainings are recorded and posted on Deputy Administrator
    for Farm Program’s Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program Training page.
    Further, Safety Net Division holds monthly Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance
    Program calls with State Office Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program specialists
    to discuss findings and answer questions. All calls are recorded and posted on
    Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program
    Training page. These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate Noninsured
    Crop Disaster Assistance Program’s improper dollars of $8.85 million related to
    statutory requirements not met.
  rnp4: "Farm Service Agency has incorporated an accountability mechanism into the\
    \ performance plans applicable to supervisory positions, as specified in Notice\
    \ PM-3065 “Fiscal Year 2023 Performance Plans” (published December 5, 2022), to\
    \ ensure adequate internal controls compliance for all programs are in place to\

  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program
    is to have an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this may not
    represent the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions taken
    by the agency have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent
    threshold.
