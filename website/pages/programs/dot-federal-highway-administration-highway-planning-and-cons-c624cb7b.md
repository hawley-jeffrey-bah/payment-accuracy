    highway system. Additionally, the program includes relief and infrastructure supplemental
    funding for the repair or reconstruction of highways and roads which have suffered
    serious damage because of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from external
    causes. The program is susceptible to significant improper payments and plans
    to report a phase 2 estimate for FY 2023.

    cyp4_1: 'FHWA’s Highway Planning and Construction program is not administered
      at the Federal level and overpayments are outside of FHWA control when grant
      recipients make administrative errors. The program supports States and Local
      Public Agencies (LPA) in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s
      highway system and various federally and tribal owned lands. FHWA funds provides
      the financial resources and mechanism to perform these activities. Tax dollars
      are allocated and distributed by FHWA directly to the State DOTs, as a direct-recipient,
      or LPAs, as sub-recipients, for eligible activities. In turn, the State DOTs
      provide oversight of LPA projects and ensure that local agencies that receive
      and deliver federally funded projects comply with Federal and State requirements.


      In recognition of FHWA’s assignment of responsibilities to the State DOTs, Congress
      requires that a formal written agreement be established between FWHA and each
      State DOT regarding the use of federal funds. The State DOT, acting on behalf
      of FHWA, is expected to exercise judgments similar to FHWA based on Federal
      laws, regulations, and policies. These responsibilities provide assurance that
      approval actions will be performed in accordance with State policies, practices
      and standards and all requirements of federal law.


      Two important characteristics of FHWA Highway Planning and Construction financial
      assistance are that it is both a reimbursable and a matching program. Reimbursable
      means that FHWA pays grantees and subrecipients the actual eligible expenses
      incurred. Money is not provided in advance, so a State DOT or LPA must initially
      finance the project and request reimbursement. A matching program means that
      the Federal funds are matched with State or local resources to cover the total
      project cost. Thus, State DOTs and LPAs are responsible for the accuracy of
      their reimbursement requests in accordance applicable Federal and State requirements.


      In summary, much of the authority for administering the FHWA financial assistance
      falls to the State DOTs, which are responsible for providing oversight and to
      ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements including the accuracy
      of payment requests.'

    payment. The corrective actions described above will address the five programmatic
    root cause categories of ineligible cost; incorrect federal share; contractual
    non-compliance; administrative error; and insufficient documentation.
  act17_2: In developing the corrective actions, FHWA considered the observations
    and remediation recommendations from FY 2024 testing and drafted agency-wide actions
    that directly address root causes for IPs. FHWA also evaluated historical improper
    payments and confirmed that two State recipients had improper payments in the
    past two years (FY 2023 and FY 2024) with one of the recipients having similar
    root causes in each year.

  pro1: FHWA’s Highway Planning and Construction program supports State and local
    governments in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s highway
    system. Additionally, the program includes relief and infrastructure supplemental
    funding for the repair or reconstruction of highways and roads which have suffered
    serious damage because of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from external
    causes. The program is susceptible to significant improper payments and plans
    to report a phase 2 estimate for FY 2025.
  rap5: At the Federal level, the program has what is needed with respect to internal
    controls, human capital, and information systems to reduce improper payments and
    unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides additional resources for administrative
    expenses as takedowns from the Highway Infrastructure Programs (HIP).  FHWA’s
    administrative funding supports salaries and benefits for approximately 2,800
    employees, as well as rent, communications, utilities, contractual services, travel,
    supplies, and equipment to support the delivery of FHWA’s programs. The FY 2025
    Administrative Expenses request will be used to effectively deliver and manage
    the $71.5 billion requested in the FY 2025 Budget for FHWA’s programs.
  rnp3: FHWA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (HCF) monitors Enterprise Financial
    Integrity Review and Evaluation (eFIRE) Program findings and recommendations to
    address identified procedures and internal control weaknesses to ensure they are
    addressed by its accessible units (AU). The AUs develop responses for procedural
    and internal control weaknesses based on the various reviews completed for eFIRE
    and other program evaluations. HCF monitors the AUs implementation periodically
    and assesses the AUs yearly performance documentation. The HCF monitors the AUs
    progress to ensure timely and effective response actions were completed.
  rnp4: 'DOT focuses its accountability mechanisms on the closure of corrective actions
    associated with improper payment remediation plans. DOT''s Deputy Chief Financial
    Officer (DCFO) is the senior accountable official responsible for completion of
    the improper payments-related remediation plans. The DCFO''s performance plan
    contains accountability mechanisms, which include closure of corrective actions
    associated with improper payment remediation plans.


    At the agency-level, FHWA''s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (HCF) administers
    the implementation of the Administration''s PIIA requirements. FHWA develops improper
    payment reduction targets, implements corrective actions and coordinates the recapture
    of improper payments identified during PIIA reviews. In addition to the PIIA-related
    sampling, FHWA conducts additional transaction testing of States and territories
    for improper payments under its Enterprise Financial Integrity Review and Evaluation
    (eFIRE) program. FHWA, through the eFIRE program and other risk-based oversight,
    incorporates additional reviews, including focus areas such as inactive projects,
    grant administration, and procurement under the administration of State DOTs using
    Federal funds. In order to effectively hold States and local governments accountable,
    the Division Office will refuse approval for project authorizations that do not
    meet federal requirements and will recover funding that was reimbursed but later
    determined to be improper.'
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: 'FHWA intends to evaluate and consider establishing a tolerable rate using
    OMB guidance throughout FY 2025. It is anticipated that a reasonable tolerable
    rate will be between 1 and 1.5%. This considers the fact that proper payment cost
    controls are significantly out of the Federal agency’s control due to statutory
    implementation requirements that provides that the State grant recipients assume
    substantial responsibility for administering the program.


    The agency works with each grant recipient to address localized root causes of
    the improper payments as identified in testing. This effort addresses the weaknesses
    in controls that are outside the agencies direct authority and will improve improper
    payment results over the long term.'

Description: The Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s (FHWA) Highway Planning and Construction
  (HPC) program supports State and Local Public Agencies in the design, construction,
  and maintenance of the Nationâ€™s highway system as well as various federally and
  tribal owned lands. The program includes relief and infrastructure supplemental
  funding for the repair or reconstruction of highways and roads which have suffered
  serious damage because of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from external
  causes. FHWA HPC is not administered at the Federal level and overpayments are outside
  of FHWA control when grant recipients make administrative errors. The program is
  susceptible to improper payments and the plan is to report a phase 2 estimate for
  FY 2025.
