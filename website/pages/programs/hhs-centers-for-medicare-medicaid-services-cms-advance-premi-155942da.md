    cyp2_1: The overpayments identified under the EIPM program are considered to be
      within the agency's control because they resulted from the improper application
      of established policies and procedures. The majority of the overpayments identified
      resulted from the agency not following it's own guidance designed to help them
      complete their tasks. These actions include improper calculation of annual income
      amounts by not conducting those calculations in accordance with established
      guidelines and accepting documentation that does not meet requirements to resolve
      data matching issues. There are also system issues that lead to overpayments
      that can be addressed by the agency, such as limits on functionality to process
      data provided by consumers.

  pro1: This year marks the first time CMS has measured the improper payment rate
    for the Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) program. CMS estimated the improper
    payment rate based on a review of a stratified random sample of applications to
    determine if the FFE properly performed the required eligibility determinations
    and paid the appropriate benefits for each sampled application. The FFE improper
    payment estimate does not reflect payments made by State-based Exchanges (SBEs).
    CMS continues to develop the SBEs improper payment measurement methodology and
    will continue to provide updates on the development status through its annual
    Agency Financial Report.
  rap5: 'The program is still trying to identify the improper payment rate below which
    further expenditures to reduce improper payments would cost more than the amount
    those expenditures would save

    '
  rap6: 'The CMS FY 2023 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees
    includes funding requests for the agency''s core responsibiities associated with
    the Exchanges.  These include verifying eligibility data for financial assistance
    through the Exchanges or other health insurance programs (including Medicaid and
    the Children’s Health Insurance Program), and ensuring the proper payment of financial
    assistance in the form of APTC to issuers where an applicant is determined eligible.  In
    order to meet these responsibilities, CMS sought funding for the Data Services
    Hub, which provides a query-based verification service with Federal entities and
    private data sources for information supplied by individuals during the application
    process. Verified data includes citizenship/immigration status, income, household
    size, and eligibility for Medicare, veteran’s benefits, or Federal employee benefits.
    When consumer-provided information does not match electronic data sources, data
    match inconsistencies are generated and CMS subsequently reviews consumer-submitted
    supporting documentation to resolve the issue.  CMS also sought funding to support
    the back end functionality of the Federal Exchange including plan management,
    and the eligibility and enrollment processes.

    when a legally applicable requirement related to payment conditions is not satisfied
    by the Exchange, however, there was no impact on the total advance premium tax
    credit.  Per 45 CFR §155.330 (d), the Federally-facilitated Exchange must periodically
    examine available data sources to identify changes in death, Medicare, Medicaid,
    and CHIP. In this scenario, the Federally-facilitated Exchange conducted periodic
    data match checks against the Social Security Administration for death data during
    the benefit year.  A large volume of periodic data match checks occurring simultaneously
    caused the technical limitation which prevented the generation of the Death Periodic
    Data Matching verification request for an enrollee   As a result of an enrollee
    was omitted from the batch in error.

  act17_1: HHS developed effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that
    are focused on identified root causes for improper payments and plans to continue
    these actions in FY 2024.  The payments that fall into the overpayment category
    are largely related to manual administrative errors and process errors. In particular
    the majority of overpayments occurred because of system defects within the Exchanges
    that may impact APTC payments. Corrective actions focused on identifying and remediating
    system defects are the best mitigation strategy since they are closely aligned
    with the largest drivers of the error rate. In addition to remediating system
    defects, HHS also plans to use staff training, audits, and risk models to address
    the root causes of improper payments in FY 2025.
  act17_2: HHS’s corrective actions largely focus on identifying and remediating system
    defects within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments. In FY 2024, HHS continued
    to remediate system defects, conduct trainings, conduct audits, and used risk
    models to address the root causes of overpayments. These actions led to an error
    rate of 1.01%. HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2025 in order to further
    reduce the error rate.
  act17_3: The planned and completed actions provide a number of corrective action
    plans designed to target the APTC error rate. Audits, automation, education, and
    risk models are all key corrective action plans to reduce the error rate and address
    the causes of improper payments.

  cyp6_1: The technically improper payments identified under the EIPM program are
    the improper payments that are recognized when a legally applicable requirement
    related to payment conditions is not satisfied by the Exchange, however, there
    was no impact on the total advance premium tax credit.  The cause of the Technically
    Improper payments was due to the Federally Facilitated Exchange failing to conduct
    periodic verifications of consumer eligibility due to technical problems interacting
    with trusted data sources.

    cyp2_1: The overpayments identified under the EIPM program are considered to be
      within the agency's control because they resulted from the improper application
      of established policies and procedures. The majority of the overpayments identified
      resulted from the agency not following it's own guidance designed to help them
      complete their tasks. These actions include improper calculation of annual income
      amounts by not conducting those calculations in accordance with established
      guidelines and accepting documentation that does not meet requirements to resolve
      data matching issues. There are also system issues that lead to overpayments
      that can be addressed by the agency, such as failing to conduct periodic verifications
      of consumer eligibility due to technical problems interacting with trusted data
      sources.

  pro1: The Reporting Year (RY) 2024 Federally-facilitated Exchange improper payment
    rate is statistically similar to the RY 2023 Federally-facilitated Exchange improper
    payment rate.
  rap5: A tolerable rate has not been established for this program. The tolerable
    rate will be identified when the State-based Exchange improper payment methodology
    is developed and the tolerable rate methodology is developed. Once the tolerable
    rate is developed, the agency can determine if we have what is needed with respect
    to internal controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure
    to reduce Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: HHS did not include program integrity proposals related to APTC in its FY
    2026 Budget request.
  rnp3: The planned and completed actions provide a number of corrective action plans
    designed to target the APTC error rate. Audits, automation, education, and risk
    models are all key corrective action plans to reduce the error rate and address
    the causes of improper payments.
  rnp4: HHS reports the agency’s improper payment targets annually in the AFR. In
    addition, HHS sets annual Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals
    tied to reducing the improper payments. HHS executive officials are held accountable
    for assessing improper payment rates and taking meaningful steps to address the
    root causes of error. These efforts are reflected in each executive’s performance
    plan, as appropriate. HHS also reports quarterly on the specific actions taken
    to address the improper payment rates through the quarterly scorecard process
    for high-priority programs, providing a level of public oversight over these efforts. 
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency has not yet established a baseline or tolerable rate, as the
    measurement does not yet include state-based exchanges.

Description: Advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) provide financial assistance
  to Marketplace consumers by reducing their monthly insurance payments. The consumer's
  APTC is based on the estimated annual household income and household size reported
  on their Marketplace application. Overpayments identified resulted from the improper
  application of established policies and procedures. Overpayments mainly occurred
  due to the improper calculation of annual income amounts caused by not following
  guidelines, and acceptance of documentation that does not meet requirements to resolve
  data matching issues. There are also system issues that lead to overpayments, such
  as limits on functionality to process consumer provided data.
