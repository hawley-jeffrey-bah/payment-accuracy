  cyp20_2: The Supplies and Materials reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper payment estimates.  Reduction
    targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has
    learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments
    legislation is that it can take three years from the point an error cause is isolated
    during testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then wait for
    payments to be made that can then be tested the following year since VA tests
    and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '129.762'
  cyp6: '129.76'
  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, all laws and regulations were not followed. Specifically, the order was
    placed by an unauthorized individual resulting in an unauthorized commitment.
    This resulted in a technically improper payment.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to the invoice pricing
    not reconciling to contract that was required to validate whether a payment was
    proper or not. The agency was missing documentation which contained key information
    that would have enabled the agency's ability to discern whether the payment was
    proper or improper. The missing documentation contained information such as the
    patient roster, contract price schedule, or despite having a contract price schedule,
    the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract due to lack of detail in
    the invoice or price schedule. For these reasons, we are unable to conclude whether
    the payment is proper or improper without that documentation.

  pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for
    FY 2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Supplies and Materials program
    decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 6.81% to 4.03% (2.78% reduction)
    and improper and unknown payments from $216.94 million to $132.01 million ($84.93
    million reduction).
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all
    requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget
    guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is
    not aware of additional program needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
    a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Supplies and Materials
    program indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were closed and determined
    to be effective in mitigating the root cause, two were open and determined to
    be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined
    that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements
    could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment
    amount from $12.55 million in FY 2020 to $3.83 million in FY 2021, or a 69% reduction.
    For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met, associated
    corrective actions contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment amount
    from $281.73 million in FY 2020 to $144.21 million in FY 2021, or a 49% reduction.
    For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated
    corrective actions did not reduce the unknown payment amount from FY 2020 to FY
    2021.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      were attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.  Change

    Specifically, the ordering officer placed a funded order; however; the required

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
    contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
    includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
    price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
    vendor's invoice. For example, VA receives an invoice of $10 for one pair of surgical
    scissors; however, the contract price schedule is $30 for "surgical supplies"
    and does not specifically include a line item and rate for the billed pair of
    surgical scissors. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether the payment
    is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost details in
    the contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing. Specifically, the
    agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack information
    in the contract price schedule. Without documentation supporting the appropriate
    contract rate information, the program is unable to determine whether the amount
    paid is proper or improper.

      in accordance with the contract rate or to validate goods billed on invoices
      were received prior to issuing payment. The agency has the direct ability to
      prevent overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes
      to ensure goods or services are received and by simplifying contract pricing.
      These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for
    FY 2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Supplies and Materials program
    decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 4.03% to 3.55% (0.48% reduction)
    and improper and unknown payments from $132.01 million to $117.46 million ($14.55
    million reduction).  Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these
    actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
  rnp3: 'The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
    were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause of technically
    improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of the program not
    met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable to determine
    whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments occurred
    because the claim was not paid according to contract terms. The majority of technically
    improper payments resulted from lack of ordering officer delegation documentation.
    The majority of unknown payments resulted from invoice pricing that did not reconcile
    to the contract. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop
    stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.
  act17_2: 'Although the overall error rate for this program increased from 3.55%
    in FY 2023 to 7.57% in FY 2024, VA made improvements. Through implementation of
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Supplies and Materials
    reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31 million in FY 2024,
    or a 96% reduction despite a $395 million increase in outlays. VA plans to expand
    and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas.


    VA''s process for development of corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    ensures the severity of the error is considered and the action is adequate. VA''s
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies have been evaluated by the Office
    of Inspector General during their FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable
    with no recommendations for improvement. The overpayments were attributed to VA''s
    failure to access data/information. The technically improper payments were attributed
    to statutory requirements of the program not met. The unknown payments were attributed
    to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Actions taken included
    restructuring existing local and national contracts and rejecting invoices that
    do not comply with contract requirements, including no receipt for goods or services.
    Additionally, VA ensured ordering processes were compliant with statute and regulation.
    Actions planned regarding change process include VA will improve contract processes
    for the Medical Supplies Prime Vendor payments and the Nutrition and Food Services
    payments to ensure payment accuracy. In addition, VA will provide education and
    training to contracting officers and/or ordering officials to ensure contracts
    contain required signatures and proper approvals are obtained prior to placing
    orders. Finally, VA will restructure existing contracts and provide education
    and training to certifying officials for rejecting invoices that do not comply
    with contract requirements.'
  act17_3: 'VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,
    and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned
    are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown
    payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly basis.
    Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure if an action
    has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments for
    a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness review
    process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued
    progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas for improvement
    were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    Through implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
    Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31
    million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction despite a $395 million increase in outlays.
    VA plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to high-risk
    program areas.'
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Supplies and Materials reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown payment estimates.
    Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing
    VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper
    payments legislation is that it can take three to five years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

  cyp6_1: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
    to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
    and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the
    right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper delegation for the order placed,
    VA lacked evidence that the order was placed by an authorized individual, or the
    contract was missing a required signature. Specifically, the ordering officer
    placed a funded order; however, the required written delegation was not in place
    at the time of the order. Also, a purchase order was not approved by an authorized
    individual prior to the purchase which resulted in an unauthorized committment.
    In addition, a contract administrative error occurred because the contract was
    missing a signature. These resulted in technically improper payments for failing
    to comply with VA Acquisition Regulations sections: Career Development, Contracting
    Authority, and Responsibilities/General (Part 801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering
    Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering Officers (Part
    816.570).'

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to obtain a proper invoice and validate invoice amounts
    are in accordance with the contract rate prior to issuing payment. A proper invoice
    was missing or despite having a contract in place that includes a price schedule,
    the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract price schedule due to lack
    of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the vendor's invoice. For example,
    VA receives an invoice of $10 for one pair of surgical scissors; however, the
    contract price schedule is $30 for "surgical supplies" and does not specifically
    include a line item and rate for the billed pair of surgical scissors. For these
    reasons, VA is unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper at
    time of payment without a proper invoice or the additional cost details in the
    contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
    payment documentation or information to validate the appropriate contract pricing.
    Specifically, the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to
    the lack information in the contract price schedule or a proper invoice was missing.
    Without a proper invoice or documentation supporting the appropriate contract
    rate information, the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is
    proper or improper.

    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed. Specifically, overpayments occur
      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Supplies
      and Materials is able to validate the correct payment to be made per the invoice
      or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements will allow for more
      accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. The
    Supplies and Materials projected improper and unknown payments remain under the
    10% compliance threshold established by the Payment Integrity Information Act
    of 2019 for the fifth consecutive year. Further, the program underwent improvements
    in FY 2024 that will increase its ability to reduce improper payments in the future.
    Through implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
    Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31
    million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction despite a $395 million increase in outlays.
    VA plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to high-risk
    program areas as well as increase the FY 2025 sample size to gain additional insight
    into the root cause errors occurring.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, Government Accountability Office
    acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments using
    effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: "The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement\
    \ corrective actions and mitigation strategies designed to reduce improper and\
    \ unknown payments. In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions\
    \ developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess\
    \ the appropriateness of corrective actions or mitigation strategies and whether\
    \ the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency.\
    \ The results for the Supplies and Materials program indicated that of the two\
    \ actions assessed, two were open and determined to be designed effectively to\
    \ mitigate the root cause. \n\nThrough implementation of effective corrective\
    \ actions and mitigation strategies, Supplies and Materials reduced overpayments\
    \ from $8.72 million in FY 2023 to $0.31 million in FY 2024, or a 96% reduction.\
    \ Additionally, Supplies and Materials experienced a $395 million increase in\
    \ outlays, specifically in program areas where technically improper payments tend\
    \ to occur. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met and for\
    \ errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective\
    \ actions did not result in a reduction from FY 2023 to FY 2024. VA plans to expand\
    \ and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas\
    \ to ensure they address the root cause(s) of error. \n\nVA will perform an effectiveness\
    \ review in FY 2025 of the corrective action plans developed and implemented in\
    \ FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions as well as to\
    \ impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2025."
  rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
    General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for
    a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers and program
    personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as change process. These
    actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024 payment integrity testing.
    VA’s executive managers to include the Executive Director of Acquisition and program
    personnel will be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained
    within their performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive
    of all their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can
    include preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal controls,
    recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts for
    known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments are
    not involved in the execution of this program.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper and
    unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively within
    existing budget authority.
