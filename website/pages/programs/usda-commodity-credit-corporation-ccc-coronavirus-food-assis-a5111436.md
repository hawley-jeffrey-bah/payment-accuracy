  rap5: "Farm Service Agency continues to strategically take the necessary steps to\
    \ strengthen internal controls measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance\
    \ processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only\
    \ make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation\
    \ at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\nFarm Service Agency will\
    \ require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal\
    \ controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting\
    \ more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   \n\
    \nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve\
    \ the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity\
    \ and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional\
    \ compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive\
    \ and robust compliance program.  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions\
    \ whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related\
    \ issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer,\
    \ but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency\
    \ to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability\
    \ and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
    \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal\
    \ controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are\
    \ still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity\
    \ to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
    \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating\
    \ the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency\
    \ program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues\
    \ to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering\
    \ Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers\
    \ duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties.\
    \ Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing\
    \ a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal\
    \ year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.\n\nInformation\
    \ Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive\
    \ measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to\
    \ reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance;\
    \ therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal\
    \ controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance\
    \ of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning\
    \ to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software\
    \ to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster\
    \ programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative\
    \ entries and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software\
    \ “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the\
    \ increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current\
    \ deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems.\
    \ \n\nFrom an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has\
    \ invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues\
    \ to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
    \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
    \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
    \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
    \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned\
    \ through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s\
    \ new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions\
    \ to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to:\
    \ 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical,\
    \ survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling”\
    \ and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are\
    \ delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a\
    \ risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified\
    \ to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics\
    \ that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating\
    \ a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators,\
    \ anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment\
    \ of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation\
    \ of authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
    \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and\
    \ determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm\
    \ Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling\
    \ of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval\
    \ and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and\
    \ the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency,\
    \ data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant\
    \ investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations\
    \ have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase\
    \ transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to\
    \ support important mission-focused decision-making.  \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm\
    \ Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program\
    \ 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity\
    \ Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss\
    \ Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio,\
    \ Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.\
    \  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity,\
    \ and the geographic servicing areas for Farm Service Agency leadership and managerial\
    \ staff have also been developed throughout fiscal year 2022.\n \n"

  rnp3: Coronavirus Food Assistance Program training was held nationwide with all
    Farm Service Agency staff before program sign up began.  Agency also held biweekly
    meetings with State Office Employees to review policy and address common program
    questions.  A notice was issued annually to discuss root causes of improper payments
    and policy review associated with those findings.  The root cause of administrative
    errors is primarily isolated to failures to follow compliance and understanding
    policy during COVID-19 pandemic.  Coronavirus Food Assistance Program was developed
    to assist producers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  COVID-19 caused offices
    to be closed to the public resulting in minimal interaction with producers to
    provide the proper guidance.  Due to previously identified staffing issues and
    requirements for rapid program implementation, Farm Service Agency has relied
    on producers to self-certify to meet program eligibility requirements (without
    the need to provide documentation) and obtain assistance.  Producer ineligibility
    is caught during an Agency spot check, after assistance has been rendered and
    payment has been made, which can result in an improper payment. With the use of
    self-certification as part of the program’s sign-up process, producers can unintentionally
    misinterpret program eligibility requirements and obtain access to federal funding
    they are ineligible to receive; thereby impeding reduction of improper payments.

  pro1: Since Coronavirus Food Assistance Program is no longer an active program,
    program risks and controls will be reviewed and updated as part of the Internal
    Controls process when new self-certification programs are developed and implemented.
    To assist in strengthening and mitigating potential risks, Farm Service Agency
    will review policies to determine where adjustments are needed to improve controls
    over payment accuracy. Corrective Actions are not at risk because the program
    has ended.
  rap5: Coronavirus Food Assistance Program has not determined a tolerable rate, as
    it is no longer an active program.
  rap6: Program did not have a budget request; Coronavirus Food Assistance Program
    is no longer an active program.
  rnp3: Since Coronavirus Food Assistance Program is no longer an active program,
    risks and controls will be reviewed and updated as part of the Internal Controls
    process when new self-certification programs are developed and implemented. To
    assist in strengthening and mitigating potential risks, Farm Service Agency will
    review policies to determine where adjustments are needed to improve controls
    over payment accuracy. These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate Coronavirus
    Food Assistance Program’s improper dollars of $7.52 million related to statutory
    requirements not met.
  rnp4: Not applicable, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program is no longer an active
    program.  FSA leadership is held accountable through annual performance appraisal
    criteria for reducing and preventing improper payments.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Coronavirus Food Assistance Program is to have
    an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this may not represent
    the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions taken by the agency
    have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent threshold.
