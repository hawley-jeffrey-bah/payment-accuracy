    cyp4_1: Overpayments outside the Agency’s control occur when the program’s failure
      to access data/information due to human errors effect the determination of whether
      or not a beneficiary or recipient should be receiving a payment. Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) provides State agencies with grants to administer the Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC,
      as established by statute, is a state-managed federal program. The nature of
      FNS programs, as established by statute, inherently makes all overpayments outside
      of Agency control.
  pro1: The cyp13 and cyp14 are not applicable as there is no margin of error or confidence
    interval associated with the data. The answer choices in cyp13 has the correct
    option. However, in cyp14, we have to choose a margin of error as a number and
    therefore, we selected zero; but the actual answer is that there is no margin
    of error associated with the estimate.
  rap5: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
    Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has what is needed with respect to internal
    controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce
    Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.  WIC program integrity
    is a priority for FNS. FNS WIC has the administrative infrastructure for meeting
    reduction targets, establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls,
    and producing yearly estimates of WIC improper payment rates and dollar values.
    Management evaluations (MEs) are FNS's primary oversight mechanisms. MEs include
    onsite reviews of State and local agency operations, and reviews of program-specific
    documentation. FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related to program integrity and
    analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
    and integrity.
  rap6: The expectation is to continue the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
    for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) funding at a level that will allow monitoring
    via Management Evaluations (MEs), provide technical assistance, and Electronic
    Benefits Transfer (EBT) support.
  rnp3: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for

    Description_Action_Taken: A prime example of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
      implementing corrective actions is through WIC oversight. FNS uses management
      evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity
      by assessing WIC State agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating
      the accomplishment of WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance
      to State agencies and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2025-2027,
      FNS' ME target area for WIC is Food Delivery and Vendor Management. Food Delivery
      involves the security and accountability of food benefits, to include the process
      of managing and monitoring the disposition of all food benefits. Vendor management
      involves the ongoing management of selection, authorization, cost containment,
      training, monitoring, and sanctioning of vendors, to include claims against
      vendors as well as the conduct of vendor-related administrative appeal procedures.
      In addition to the ME target area, FNS also conducts a national risk-based ME
      assessment to identify State agencies with known program integrity issues. Program
      integrity issues include issues relating to improper payments, vendor management,
      certification/eligibility, fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary
      values risk to the Program. The target area supports the United States Department
      of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer
      service to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC
      Program through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS
      continues to analyze ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
      and integrity. This includes addressing certification and vendor issues that
      could result in improper payments.

    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has implemented
      several opportunities of training for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
      for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Annual training is provided on FNS’
      National Management Evaluation (ME) guidance to regional office staff who conduct
      MEs. The goal of this training is to establish standards for FNS to effectively
      communicate findings and corrective action expectations to State agencies, provide
      necessary technical assistance, and support State agency program improvements.
      Additional WIC specific ME training is conducted throughout the year to support
      regional staff by holding bi-monthly meetings to discuss best practices and
      provide technical assistance, as well as specific technical assistance as needed
      to improve understanding and compliance of ME activities. Additional training
      is provided to state agencies through specific technical assistance during oversight
      activities. Training activities for State agency staff are further identified
      through the results of an annual target area report. This report looks at national
      trends of program integrity issues as well as programmatic deficiencies across
      all State agencies to issue technical assistance, policy memos, and training
      as needed. FNS has also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies
      that target improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification.
      These resources include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook,
      a new toolkit on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and
      an updated tool for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality.

  act17_1: The mitigation strategy for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is to
    provide additional guidance on vendor cost containment which will be designed
    to increase compliance which could reduce improper payments. FNS uses management
    evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs enforce program integrity
    by assessing the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
    Children (WIC) state agency compliance with requirements and provide technical
    assistance to agencies. ME materials are continuously being reviewed, improved,
    and updated. The ME process supports integrity in the WIC program through the
    timely resolution of issues that could result in improper payments.
  act17_2: Program specific training on program regulations, policies, and guidance
    is provided to the Food and Nutrition Service(FNS) and State agency staff of the
    Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).
    Policies and guidance, such as memos and handbooks, cover both root causes of
    certification and vendor errors. If FNS oversight activities of WIC State agencies’
    operations reveal specific problems in these or any other Program functional areas,
    it's addressed through a corrective action plan and monitored until implementation
    and all issues are resolved.
  act17_3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regularly conducts training and evaluates
    effectiveness of training and oversight of the Special Supplemental Nutrition
    Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) via management evaluations (MEs).
    When FNS identifies errors immediate feedback and technical assistance is provided
    to the State agency. When issues are identified during a ME it is the priority
    of FNS that they be addressed timely. State agencies are required to submit a
    corrective action plan for ME findings within 60 calendar days. FNS will then
    respond to the corrective plan within 20 calendar days. FNS monitors each corrective
    action until it is fully implemented. FNS verifies the implementation before closing
    the finding.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: 'The target reduction rate is equal to the estimated future Improper Payment
    and Unknown Payment rate because the current error rate is based on administrative
    or process errors made by State or Local Agencies (i.e., is outside of FNS'' direct
    control). For FY 2024, WIC''s error rate was 1.42% ($62.85 million) based on two
    components: certification and vendor error. FNS makes use of periodic studies
    to assess the level of error in program payments and will not field a new study
    to establish a revised error rate before next year’s reporting cycle. Since measuring
    the level of error in the program annually is cost prohibitive, and the current
    error rate will bring the Program into phase one, it wouldn’t be prudent use of
    taxpayer dollars to pursue a low error rate.'

    cyp4_1: Overpayments outside the agency’s control occur when the programs failure
      to access data/information due to human errors effect the determination of whether
      or not a beneficiary or recipient should be receiving a payment. The Food and
      Nutrition Service (FNS) provides State agencies with grants to administer The
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  WIC,
      as established by statute, is a state-managed federal program. The nature of
      FNS programs, as established by statute, inherently makes all overpayments outside
      of Agency control.
  pro1: "1) Please note that USDA made a mistake in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 reporting\
    \ on paymentaccuracy.gov and need to make the following correction to the Special\
    \ Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) data call.\
    \ The question asking \"Does the Improper Payment and Unknown Payment estimate\
    \ establish a baseline (starting point or benchmark) against which future progress\
    \ can be assessed or comparisons made?\" was answered \"no\" in FY23.  The Food\
    \ and Nutrition Service received clarity on what is considered a baseline after\
    \ the FY2023 WIC Data call was submitted, and revises this response for FY23 to\
    \ \"yes.\" \n2) Note for FY 2024 WIC there is no margin of error with the data.\
    \ FNS reported zero to represent that there is no margin of error associated with\
    \ the estimate."
  rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments and
    Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
    for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program integrity is a priority for the
    Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). FNS has the administrative infrastructure for
    meeting reduction targets, establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls,
    and producing yearly estimates of WIC improper payment rates and dollar values.
    Management evaluations (MEs) are FNS's primary oversight mechanisms. MEs include
    onsite reviews of State and local agency operations, and reviews of program-specific
    documentation. FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related to program integrity and
    analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
    and integrity.
  rap6: The expectation is to continue the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
    for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) funding at a level that will allow monitoring
    via management evaluations (MEs), provide technical assistance, and Electronic
    Benefits Transfer (EBT) support.
  rnp3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses management evaluations (MEs) as
    its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing the Special
    Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) State agency
    compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of WIC Program
    objectives, and providing technical assistance to State Agencies and supporting
    efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024, FNS' ME target area for WIC
    was Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition services is essential
    to carrying out the Program's mission. The Nutrition Services Management Evaluation
    examines how State agencies plan for and deliver nutrition services, including
    nutrition and breastfeeding education. The FY 2020-2024 target area also included
    a focus on updating existing ME materials and technology. The target area supports
    USDA and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer service to
    WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC Program through
    the timely resolution of issues identified through Management Evaluations. FNS
    continues to analyze Management Evaluation data to identify opportunities to improve
    program administration and integrity. The FY 2020-2024 target area and ongoing
    Management Evaluation data analysis support integrity in the WIC Program through
    the timely resolution of issues identified through reviews. This includes addressing
    certification and vendor issues that could result in improper payments.
