      death may go unreported. OPM relies on annuitant's family members and other
      sources to officially report the annuitant's death.  However, OPM conducts surveys
      and matches to mitigate potential improper payments resulting from these events.
      OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies that may exist between the
      OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system.
      The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly
      to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA. The Validated Agency
      Match System processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits
      and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for
      any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match
      is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA
      Death Master File (DMF).

    Description_Action_Taken: 'RS is aware of the improper payments; however, systemic
      limitations prevent RS from providing the needed level of specificity. OPM’s
      systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of
      data. Therefore, based on OMB''s predetermined root cause categories, only the
      category "failure to access data" applies. There are overpayments within the
      agency’s control that are are the result of annuitant''s family members and
      other sources failing to report annuitant''s death. The overpayments are considered
      to be within the agency''s control because RS has access to the death master
      file but does not

      access for each recurring payment. However, as our on-going internal control
      activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper
      payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies

    cyp2_1: Overpayments within the agency’s control are generally the result of antiquated
      systems that fail to automate the processing of available intra-agency data
      while the payments are being processed. Additionally, the outdated systems fail
      to provide large quantities of specific data in order to pinpoint risk areas
      of improper payments. For example, overpayments occurred because the death data
      isn’t directly linked to the payment file to allow for immediate suspension
      of accounts. The overpayments are considered to be within the agency’s control
      because RS has access to the death data. The agency has put measures in place
      to mitigate improper payments to include annuitant surveys sent electronically
      or by mail to solicit eligibility. It also conducts a Consolidated Death Match
      (CDM), comparing the annuity roll to the full death master file from SSA on
      a weekly cadence, suspending and dropping accounts on the list that fail to
      respond to notices. The agency also utilizes Bureau of Fiscal Services’ Do Not
      Pay (DNP) portal, conducting monthly searches of annuitants who are reported
      as deceased through the death data sources (i.e. EVVE-FOD, DOD, DOS, AIS-OBIT,
      AIS-PROB, PACER, DMF-Public), verifying death and stopping further payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: RS acknowledges the occurrence of improper payments;
      however, systemic limitations hinder the provision of detailed specificity.
      OPM's systems were not designed to analyze large data sets. Consequently, based
      on OMB's established root cause categories, only "failure to access data" is
      applicable. Overpayments within the agency’s purview result from family members
      or other sources failing to report an annuitant's death. These overpayments
      are deemed under the agency’s control because RS has access to the Do Not Pay
      file but is unable to search Do Not Pay prior to each recurring payment. Nevertheless,
      OPM engages in ongoing internal control activities, including surveys and data
      matching, to reduce potential improper payments from these occurrences. OPM
      performed the Consolidated Death Match (CDM) to identify discrepancies between
      the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system.
      This weekly match helps identify annuitants reported deceased by the SSA, while
      the Validated Agency Match System processes death information to terminate federal
      benefits and prevent further improper payments. Collection actions are initiated
      for any discovered overpayments.  Additionally, OPM utilizes the Treasury's
      Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants who should have been reported deceased.

      Tool converts information into a confidence score based on the likelihood the
      individual is truly deceased. The Office of Payment Integrity at the Department
      of Treasury then uses the confidence score in combination with payment information

  act17_1: An upgrade to the current legacy system is necessary to accurately categorize
    the root causes of improper payments. RS is currently seeking additional funding
    to enhance process automation.  The FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification
    includes $6.5 million for improving the online retirement application and digital
    file system.   RS is unable to properly categorize $243.70 million in overpayments.
    However, regular Quality Assurance audits help assess accuracy and identify any
    training or systemic deficiencies.  Delayed or absent reporting from an annuitant's
    family or other sources can result in improper payments. The improper payment
    rate decreased from FY 2023 to FY 2024, demonstrating the effectiveness of current
    corrective actions.
  act17_2: The corrective actions provided focus on the steps RS has taken to accurately
    categorize the root causes of improper payments.  RS continues to request addition
    funding from OMB to achieve this goal. The use of Quality Assurance audits help
    assess accuracy and identify any training or systemic deficiencies.  The improper
    payment rate decreased from FY2023 to FY2024, demonstrates the effectiveness of
    the current corrective actions.
  act17_3: The corrective actions provided focus on the steps RS has taken to accurately
    categorize the root causes of improper payments.  RS continues to request addition
    funding from OMB to achieve this goal. The use of Quality Assurance audits help
    assess accuracy and identify any training or systemic deficiencies.  Delayed or
    absent reporting from an annuitant's family or other sources can result in imroper
    payments.  RS plans to use the Death Record Scoring Tool (DRC Scoring Tool).  This
    tool is a product used to identify payments at risk of being issued to a deceased
    payee.  The goal of adding this tool to the corrective actions is to reduce improper
    payments.   The improper payment rate decreased from FY2023 to FY2024, demonstrates
    the effectiveness of the current corrective actions.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: RS is committed to the objective of reducing improper payments. OPM set
    a goal of lowering the improper rate by 0.01 percent for each subsequent year.
    The current Improper Payment and Unknown Payment rate was 0.33 percent.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: Federal agencies are required to provide complete retirement packages.
    Through audits, the Quality Assurance Group identifies retirement claims that
    need additional information or clarification to determine if a recipient is receiving
    the correct monthly benefit. Insufficient or missing evidence can result in unknown
    payments. These types of errors can impact the amount of the improper payment
    amount. The improper payment amount is also impacted by the length of time it
    takes to receive sufficient information. The payment cannot be moved out of the
    unknown category and classified as proper or improper until all necessary documentation
    is received.
  cyp8: Payments may be classified as unknown when additional information is required
    to confirm the accuracy of a recipient's monthly benefit. Insufficient or missing
    evidence can also result in unknown payments.  More accurate Agency application
    submissions would potentially mitigate common causes of unknown payments.

    cyp2_1: 'Overpayments within the agency''s control typically stem from outdated
      systems that do not automate the processing of available intra-agency data during
      payment processing. These antiquated systems lack the capability to provide
      comprehensive data necessary for identifying risk areas related to improper
      payments. For instance, overpayments often occur because death data is not directly
      linked to the payment file, preventing immediate account suspensions. Although
      the agency has access to this death data, overpayments are still considered
      within our control.  To mitigate improper payments, the agency employs several
      measures, including: Annuitant Surveys: These are sent electronically or by
      mail to verify eligibility.   Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal: Monthly searches are
      performed to verify deaths reported through various sources (e.g., EVVE-FOD,
      DOD, DOS) to prevent further payments.'

  rap5: Using the existing internal controls, human capital, and information systems
    and other infrastructure RS was able to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown
    Payments to achieve the tolerable rate. The FY 2024 Improper Payments and Unknown
    Payments rate is 0.33 percent. The improper payment rate for overpayments was
    0.32 percent.
  rap6: An upgrade to the current legacy system is essential for properly categorizing
    the root causes of improper payments. RS leadership is actively pursuing modernization
    initiatives to prevent such payments, collaborating with OPM leadership to prioritize
    and secure funding. An IT Roadmap has been delivered, with modernization costs
    assessed through FY 2028.

  rnp4: The Retirement Services Associate Director is accountable for the improper
    payment rate.  This criteria is an item included in the annual performance appraisal.  In
    addition, RS operation managers are held accountable for achieving accuracy in
    the initial adjudication of claims.  The Quality Assurance audit results provide
    the accuracy rate.   Another step taken is the Annual Assurance Statement and
    Management Controls.  The Retirment Services Associate Director sign a memo statement
    that she is aware of the internal controls and meeting the requirements of the
    Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA)

Description: RS provides Federal employees, retirees and their families with benefits
  that offer choice, value, and quality to be a competitive employer. Eligible retirees
  and survivors generally receive recurring monthly benefits. The status of an annuitant
  may change and result in a change to the benefits due. Life event changes may occur
  (i.e. a death, marriage, termination of a marriage, child eligibility, or earnings
  limitations). A known barrier is reliance on self-reporting by annuitants and on
  other sources. Delayed or the absence of reporting can result in improper payments.
  To mitigate improper payments, RS conducts various surveys and matches. An additional
  barrier is the legacy system doesn't provide the needed granularity for root cause.
