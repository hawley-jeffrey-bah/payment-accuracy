  cyp20_2: The FY 2022 improper payment rate estimate of 1.99 percent for this program
    is less than the target reduction rate of 2.97 percent from FY 2021.   Because
    the lower bound of its confidence interval, 0.21 percent, is lower than the reduction
    target of 2.97 percent, in accordance with OMB Appendix C to Circular A-123 (March
    2021), the 504 loan guaranty approval program is considered to have met the reduction
    target. For FY 2023, the SBA established a reduction target of 1.89 percent for
    the 504 Certified Development Loans Approvals program.

    one 504 loan was identified with an unknown improper payment in the amount of
    $116,781 was categorized as an unknown payment.  SBA is awaiting real estate appraisal

    identified as a result of the FY 2022 PIIA reviews have been resolved through
    obtaining additional documentation, loan modification, or cancellation of the
