  cyp20_2: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements reduction target is equal to
    the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
    reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper payment
    estimates.  Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic.
    One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
    improper payments legislation is that it can take three years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '22.21'
  cyp6: '22.21'
  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, all laws and regulations were not followed. Specifically, either the order
    was placed by an unauthorized individual or the contract was missing the proper
    signature, or a request was not sent to procurement to create a contract. These
    resulted in technically improper payments.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to the vendor invoice
    or certification of receipt, inability to validate pricing, or invoice pricing
    does not reconcile to contract that was required to validate whether a payment
    was proper or not. The agency was missing documentation which contained key information
    that would have enabled the agency's ability to discern whether the payment was
    proper or improper. The missing documentation contained information such as the
    patient roster, contract price schedule, or despite having a contract price schedule,
    the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract due to lack of detail in
    the price schedule. For these reasons, we are unable to conclude whether the payment
    is proper or improper without that documentation.

  pro1: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments and is expected to achieve compliance with the Payment
    Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY 2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY
    2022, the Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program decreased its improper
    and unknown error rate from 15.99% to 7.47% (8.52% reduction) and improper and
    unknown payments from $159.34 million to $78.49 million ($80.85 million reduction).
  rap5: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program has not yet determined the
    tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all requirements for establishing a
    tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting
    to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program
    needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
    a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Medical Care Contracts
    and Agreements program indicated that of the four actions assessed, one was closed
    and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, and three were open
    and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root
    cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine
    the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s)
    of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information as well as for errors tied
    to statutory requirements of program were not met, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2020
    to FY 2021. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
    reduction in the unknown payment amount from $116.34 million in FY 2020 to $78.20
    million in FY 2021, or a 33% reduction.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      which ensures accuracy of testing results and improves understanding of requirements
      for future purchases, as well as obtaining additional documentation required
      to determine payment accuracy. These actions are designed to reduce overpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      were attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Change process

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
    contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
    includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
    price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
    vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether or not the billed
    amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice of $10
    for a complete blood test lab service but the contract price schedule only indicates
    a total cost of $300 for all blood lab services. In this scenario, the contract
    price does not contain sufficient detail to confirm the cost of a complete blood
    test is $10. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether the payment is
    proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost details in the
    contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing, lack of payment documentation,
    or lack of documentation related to invoice submittal requirements. Specifically,
    the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack of
    information in the contract price schedule, or insufficient information on the
    invoice to be able to determine the appropriate amount billed and paid. In addition,
    the agency was unable to determine if the required invoice submittal documentation
    was obtained per the contract. Without documentation supporting the appropriate
    information per the contract or per the invoice, the program is unable to determine
    whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Medical
      Care Contracts and Agreements is able to validate the correct payment to be
      made per the invoice or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements
      will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its second consecutive year of reductions.
    Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Medical Care Contracts and Agreements
    program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 7.47% to 3.95% (3.52%
    reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $78.49 million to $45.72 million
    ($32.77 million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of
    these actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes of improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
    and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause
    of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of
    the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable
    to determine whether proper or improper. The majority of overpayments occurred
    because claims were not paid according to the contract. The majority of technically
    improper payments occurred due to a lack of request sent for procurement action
    when a contract was required for purchase. The majority of unknown payments occurred
    because the invoice pricing did not reconcile to the contract and inability to
    validate pricing. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to
    develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment
    processes. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate the importance
    of consistencies in standard operating procedures.
  act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 3.95% in FY 2023 to 2.28%
    in 2024. This resulted in a reduction of $17.47 million by implementing effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
    is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
    FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
    The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to VA's failure to access data/information.
    The technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of
    the program not met. The unknown payments were attributed to being unable to determine
    whether proper or improper. Actions taken regarding change process included restructuring
    existing local and national contracts and rejecting invoices that do not comply
    with contract requirements. Additionally, VA ensured ordering processes were compliant
    with statute and regulation. VA also continued conducting an annual concurrence
    process to meet with field offices, which ensures accuracy of testing results
    and improves understanding of requirements for future purchases, as well as obtaining
    additional documentation required to determine payment accuracy. Actions planned
    regarding training include providing training to individuals who are incorrectly
    certifying invoices for payment.
  act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and
    no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are
    appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown
    payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a quarterly basis.
    Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to measure if an action
    has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments for
    a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness review
    process allows VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued
    progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas for improvement
    were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. The decrease
    in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from 3.95% in FY 2023 to 2.28%
    in FY 2024, and the $17.47 million reduction in improper and unknown payments
    supports the effective implementation and prioritization of action within the
    agency.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements reduction target is equal to
    the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
    reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown
    payment estimates. Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and
    realistic. One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to
    comply with improper payments legislation is that it can take three to five years
    from the point an error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective
    action, implement it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested
    the following year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

  cyp6_1: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
    to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
    and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the
    right person in the right amount, the purchase was made without a required contract
    or VA lacked evidence the purchase was made by an authorized individual. Specifically,
    there was a lack of request for procurement action when a contract was required
    for purchase or a purchase order was not approved by an authorized individual
    prior to the purchase which resulted in an unauthorized committment. This resulted
    in technically improper payments for failing to comply with VA Acquisition Regulations
    sections: Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General
    (Part 801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering Officers (Part 808.470), and
    Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering Officers (Part 816.570).'

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
    contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
    includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
    price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
    vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether or not the billed
    amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice of $10
    for a complete blood test lab service but the contract price schedule only indicates
    a total cost of $300 for all blood lab services. In this scenario, the contract
    price does not contain sufficient detail to confirm the cost of a complete blood
    test is $10. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether the payment is
    proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost details in the
    contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
    documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing or missing documentation
    related to invoice submittal requirements. Specifically, the agency was unable
    to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack of information in the contract
    price schedule, or insufficient information on the invoice to be able to determine
    the appropriate amount billed and paid. In addition, the agency was unable to
    determine if the required invoice submittal documentation was obtained per the
    contract. Without documentation supporting the appropriate information per the
    contract or per the invoice, the program is unable to determine whether the amount
    paid is proper or improper.

    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed. Specifically, overpayments occur
      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Medical
      Care Contracts and Agreements is able to validate the correct payment to be
      made per the invoice or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements
      will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its third consecutive year of reductions.
    Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Medical Care Contracts and Agreements
    program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 3.95% to 2.28% (1.67%
    reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $45.72 million to $28.25 million
    ($17.47 million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of
    these actions on its FY 2025 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
    Office acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
    using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: "The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program continues to prioritize\

    \ FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and implement actions as well as to\
    \ impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2025."
  rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
    General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for
    a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers and program
    personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as change process. These
    actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024 payment integrity testing.
    VA’s executive managers to include the Executive Director of Acquisition and program
    personnel will be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained
    within their performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive
    of all their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can
    include preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal controls,
    recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts for
    known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments are
    not involved in the execution of this program.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper and
    unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively within
    existing budget authority.
