  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program will establish
      Defense

      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) site and commercial pay system-specific
      working groups in fiscal year 2024. The primary purpose of this Department-wide
      working group initiative to ensure the creation of the new standard operating
      procedures and appropriate milestones are established to reduce technically
      improper and unknown payments associated with documentation retention to substantiate
      the payments. DFAS Post-Pay Review & Analysis team will provide training to
      review teams regarding proper documentation required for government credit card
      transactions. This Training will be provided to the review teams during the
      annual kick off meeting on the appropriate documentation required to complete
      sample packages along with specific examples of acceptable documentation.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The Department Commercial Pay Working Groups will collaborate
      to identify the repository systems for payments made under the Commercial Pay
      Program. Each Defense Finance and Accounting Service site responsible for payments
      under the Commercial Pay program will determine whether the program lacks information
      or data systems to confirm eligibility or provide for other payment integrity
      needs. Furthermore, the Department is establishing an additional Department-wide
      working group to perform a Risk Assessment to identify the causes and volume
      of technically improper payments made when regulatory and/or statutory requirements
      were not met to substantiate the payment.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app4_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program cross enterprise
      sharing corrective actions will focus on the collaboration from various Components
      throughout the

      Department to bolster internal controls preventing improper payments. This Department
      endeavor will be fairly complex given the nature of commercial vendor payments
      coupled with existing accounting and contracting systems. Additionally, the
      Department will synchronize various efforts with the Treasury

      Department''s Payment Integrity resources and available tools.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app5_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The two contributing categories that caused the Department's
      Commercial Pay program to exceed the OMB statutory threshold is a combination
      of Technically Improper ($119.21 Million) and Unknown Payments ($104.37 Million).
      The planned corrective actions addresses the root cause problems responsible
      for the increase in improper and unknown payments from fiscal year 2022 to 2023.
      Primarily the lack of a formal process to ensure documentation is retained to
      substantiate payments and a risk assessment on the severity of lack of adherence
      to proper contractual and or invoice regulations.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Department pursues continuous training actions for
      current and new employees throughout the Commercial Pay program. Additionally,
      through trend and root cause analysis, specific training is provided to prevent
      improper payments for technician error. When the root cause is for other than
      technician error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault
      i.e., contracting personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name
      a few.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp17_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program did not have
      a formal corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on prior year findings.
      Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual improper payments
      plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the prior reporting
      year, the

      Department''s Commercial Pay program reported a total of $67.48 million in improper
      plus unknown payments, which is significantly below the statutory threshold.
      Hence, no specific corrective actions were taken for this program.


      The Department pursues continuous training actions for current and new employees
      throughout the Commercial Pay program. Additionally, through trend and root
      cause analysis specific training is provided to prevent improper

      payments for technician error. When the root cause is for other than technician
      error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana
      detection tool is continually monitored and evaluated to rank and rate proposed

      integrity checks to identify and prevent improper payments in the pre-payment
      environment.'

  2022:
    pro1: The Department’s Commercial Pay Payment Integrity program consists of payments
      disbursed by Defense Finance and Accounting Service, the Army, and the Navy
      to vendors and contractors for goods and services.  It also includes Disaster
      Relief and Coronavirus response funding payments made by the Military Services
      and DoD Components.

    rnp3: In FY 2021, there were no total estimated improper and unknown payments
      identified for the Commercial Pay program.  As the amount of improper and unknown
      payments estimated in this program differed greatly from the results of payment
      recovery audit and activity (PRA) efforts, the Department performed an assessment
      of the Payment Integrity Commercial Pay program.  To ensure accuracy in reporting
      and streamline efforts, the Department developed a new Sampling & Estimation
      Methodology Plan (S&EMP), effective in FY 2022, designed in accordance with
      the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and the guidelines in the
      OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C.  The S&EMP also incorporates recommendations
      from the DoD Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.  In
      addition to the S&EMP, the DoD established a Program-wide Payment Integrity
      Risk Appetite Statement to prioritize strategic payment integrity objectives
      while balancing the cost benefits and operational considerations to the Department.  In
      order to facilitate the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders throughout
      the Department, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Payment
      Integrity Team, established the Payment Integrity Commercial Pay Compliance
      Working Group with the Military Departments and components of the Defense Finance
      and Accounting Service. By establishing this Department objective of fully complying
      with the requirements of the PIIA the monthly working group contributed to the
      alignment of the Payment Integrity Program review operations and provided a
      platform for training and the flow of feedback across the Department.  Simultaneously
      with the Commercial Pay program revamp, the PRA Commercial Pay Working Group
      made great strides in streamlining the monitoring and recovery of overpayments
      made by the Department in an effort to ensure accuracy in reporting.

      deliberate effort to achieve compliance with Payment Integrity Information Act
      of 2019. The Department will be targeting payments with a higher risk of being

    rap6: The Commercial Pay Payment Integrity program did not have any specific Payment
      Integrity recent budget submissions, which the Office of the Under Secretary

    rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the
      Department can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs
      that are currently in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded
      that the previous Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily
      by using an inappropriate variable which led to insufficient sample sizes, and
      incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample
      population for testing. The Department has since implemented several DoD OIG
      recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations for the Payment Integrity
      Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating a Payment
      Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the population
      to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity teams
      have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by the
      DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by testing
      higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and process
      is anticipated to produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline the
      Department’s efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance
      during the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has
      DoD OIG confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish
      effective and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    cyp6_1: The Commercial Pay - program's Technically Improper Payments were attributed
      to payments made to vendors not adhering to contractual law and/or regulations.
      One example is a vendor that was inadvertently paid the correct amount and timely;
      however, the invoice and subsequent voucher was processed for a different contract
      modification.

    cyp8: When a payment cannot be reviewed due to missing or insufficient key supporting
      documentation, the payment is considered unknown until an accurate determination
      can be made.  Occasionally the key supporting documentation is maintained by
      a different Component or section within the Department, then the Component who
      is assigned to perform the Payment Integrity review. The Component maintaining
      the key supporting documentation may not be able to respond to requests to obtain
      the substantiating payment related documentation within a predetermined performance
      timeline for the Payment Integrity compliance operational reviews.

      The Department''s Commercial Pay program''s Unknown Payments were transactions
      where the source documentation supporting the payment were not able to be obtained
      prior to the deadlines for the program year. The majority of the unknown payments
      were from two entitlement systems for Government Credit Cards. The payments
      information is electronically transmitted to the entitlement system but the
      original payment documentation to support the payment does not reside in the
      entitlement system. The payment sites have reached out to request the original
      documentation to support the interfaced payments but were not able to access
      the documentation before the end of the reporting year.'
