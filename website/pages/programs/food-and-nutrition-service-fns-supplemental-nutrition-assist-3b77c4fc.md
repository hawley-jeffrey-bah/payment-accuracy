  2023:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) plans to conduct additional
      training and provide resources aimed at equipping State agencies with the knowledge
      needed to improve their own specific causes of payment error. This is critical
      since each State agency will vary in terms of causes of error and approaches/options
      to reduce error. At a higher level, the Keys to Payment Accuracy will also provide
      additional, updated guidance on how State agencies can improve payment accuracy.
      Additionally, by providing third-party income verification resources to all
      State agencies, FNS is addressing a common cause of payment errors in SNAP related
      to accurate income determinations in the financial criteria element.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Since the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) is administered by State agencies, who also determine the structure of
      SNAP amongst numerous policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects, corrective
      actions must originate in and be tailored to each individual State agency's
      circumstances and particular root causes of payment error. As such, FNS is primarily
      focused on providing training and equipping State agencies with the knowledge
      and tools needed to individually develop meaningful root cause analysis and
      corrective action plans, including through the issuance of policy guidance.
      Additional tools planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 include new dashboards for
      State use in conducting root cause analysis and a new payment accuracy data
      entry and analysis system for State and Federal users. FNS has also contracted
      support to update the Keys to Payment Accuracy, a guidance document for State
      SNAP administering agencies on key strategies for improving payment accuracy.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: Because payment errors in the Supplemental Nutrition
      Assistance Program (SNAP) will vary by State agency, Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) takes an approach that equips each State agency with the knowledge and
      tools needed to conduct an individualized root cause analysis and develop targeted
      corrective action plans. This approach allows each State agency to apply the
      knowledge learned to their specific situation, including chosen program options,
      waivers, and demonstration projects, and target corrective actions specific
      to their unique root causes. Additionally, FNS regional office staff and national
      office staff regularly provide technical assistance on an individual, as needed,
      basis - including targeted training, assistance in identifying root causes of
      error, or, for issues with more general applicability, through policy memoranda
      and guidance.

      State agencies with the knowledge and tools needed to individually develop meaningful
      root cause analysis and corrective action plans, including through the issuance
      of policy guidance. In FY 2023, FNS conducted a root cause analysis training
      series that provided training to State agencies on how to conduct a root cause
      analysis using FNS-provided and widely available tools (such as Excel). The
      series featured policy staff at FNS that explored different policy responses
      and resources available to address root causes of payment error. Several State
      agencies presented throughout the series on approaches they took and the results
      they saw. All sessions offered a question and answer component as well, allowing
      State agencies to ask questions tailored to their situation. FNS also developed
      tools to assist with conducting root cause analysis by State agencies, created
      dashboards for FNS to better identify State agencies struggling with payment
      errors, and issued guidance to State agencies on improving verification procedures
      and developing corrective action plans. FNS verification guidance documents
      related to income verification sources and using information received from other
      public assistance programs. FNS also provided significant guidance and technical
      assistance to assist States in managing the transition from COVID-19 related
      administrative flexibilities back to normal processes while keeping a focus
      on payment accuracy.

  2024:
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue to
      conduct training for State agencies and will provide additional tools to conduct
      root cause analysis and identify trends in error rate data. Additional tools
      include new dashboards for State use and a new payment accuracy data entry and
      analysis system.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) entered into contracts
      to provide State Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administering
      agencies with access to two commercial databases of employment and earnings
      records. As of September 12, 2024, 27 states have onboarded to one or both vendors'
      services. States can use these services to verify earned income sources and
      amounts for SNAP households. Since income is a key factor in the SNAP benefit
      calculation, these efforts are expected to help improve payment accuracy.

      with conducting root cause analysis by State agencies, including publishing
      two dashboards for State Quality Control (QC) managers and staff to use to analyze
      causes of payment errors and trends over time and held two training sessions
      with both State and Federal users. FNS also introduced the new Keys to Payment
      Accuracy, that provides best practices to states on how to improve payment accuracy
      and began a series of webinars targeted to state and regional office staff to
      discuss how to use the Keys as they develop their payment accuracy related corrective
      action plans.

    pro1: "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will not issue an error\
      \ rate for FY 2021 due to a lack of information. Specifically, COVID-19 related\
      \ flexibilities provided to the State agencies that administer SNAP, and provisions\
      \ in both 2021 continuing appropriations acts (P.L. 116-159 and 116-260), suspended\
      \ the quality control system SNAP uses to collect error rate data for significant\
      \ portions of FY 2020 and FY 2021. Quality control activities have resumed for\
      \ FY 2022 and as a Phase 2 program, SNAP will submit official improper payment\
      \ rates in 2023.\nAlthough SNAP is unable to report an improper payment estimate\
      \ for the current reporting year, certain payment integrity activities continue,\
      \ including the following:\nThere are a number of recovery-related activities\
      \ to identify and recover overpayments. Recipient claims are established against\
      \ households that receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\
      \ benefits than they are entitled to receive or households that have trafficked\
      \ benefits (exchanged for cash). According to section 13(b) of The Food and\
      \ Nutrition Act of 2008, States must collect all over- issuances of SNAP benefits.\
      \ SNAP regulations at 7 CFR 273.18(b) require State agencies to develop plans\
      \ to establish and collect on claims. State agencies use various methods to\
      \ collect claims. The two primary methods are allotment reduction and the Federal\
      \ debt collection programs such as the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Allotment\
      \ reduction is when the household’s benefits are reduced each month to collect\
      \ the claim. Allotment reduction is the primary collection method for households\
      \ that continue to participate in SNAP. \nState agencies refer delinquent claims\
      \ to the TOP. This is the most effective collection method for households that\
      \ no longer participate in SNAP. TOP intercepts Federal payments to individuals.\
      \ The sources for these offsets vary but currently they are primarily from Federal\
      \ income tax refunds and Federal salaries. \nOther methods of collection include\
      \ but are not limited to: lump sum and installment payments, wage garnishments,\
      \ unemployment compensation benefit intercepts, and State income tax refund\
      \ and lottery winnings. \nIn order to monitor and oversee State agency management\
      \ and operations of SNAP, FNS regional office staff conduct Management Evaluations\
      \ and Financial Management Reviews each year to ensure State and local agencies\
      \ are complying with Federal regulations and using funds for intended purposes.\
      \ Data gathered through this process provides a basis for assessing the administration\
      \ of FNS programs and planning future management objectives. With this information,\
      \ FNS can identify the types, frequency, and scope of problems that are occurring\
      \ and target resources to correcting the problems. \nFNS regional offices conduct\
      \ Recipient Claims Management Evaluation Reviews (RCMERs) which examine a State\
      \ agency’s or local SNAP office’s operations to determine compliance with Federal\
      \ SNAP requirements governing establishment and collection of SNAP claims. The\
      \ review focuses on recipient claim establishment activities, including recoupment\
      \ and collection, TOP procedures, and quality control error review.\nAlthough\
      \ SNAP will not issue a payment error rate for FY 2021, because legislation\
      \ related to the COVID-19 public health emergency suspended the QC system for\
      \ significant portions of the year, other oversight activities such as management\
      \ evaluations, technical assistance, and CAPS continue. \nOne example of technical\
      \ assistance conducted in FY 2021 to help prevent improper payments and ensure\
      \ those that do occur are promptly detected and recovered involved verification\
      \ of household earned income. State agencies are required to verify a household’s\
      \ gross non-exempt income prior to certification in all cases. States typically\
      \ meet this requirement for earned income, a common top driver of errors year\
      \ to year, by requesting that the household provide documentary evidence such\
      \ as pay stubs. In addition, many States consult a third-party income database\
      \ to request documentation of the household's income. In FY 2021, FNS provided\
      \ grants to 16 States to evaluate best practices and effects of State SNAP agency\
      \ usage of commercially available third-party income databases to verify household\
      \ earned income. States participated in interviews and submitted two datasets\
      \ designed to systematically measure variations in usage and impacts. FNS is\
      \ still reviewing that data."

    rnp4: The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, provides disincentives in
      the form of financial penalties to encourage States to accurately issue Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and maintain low improper payment
      rates. The liability process to establish financial penalties against State
      agencies is statutory. In addition, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has
      a regulatory process that requires States to enter into corrective actions at
      the State level to address payment error rates that exceed six percent, a standard
      established by law.

  2024:
    act17_1: In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) conducted
      additional training and provided resources aimed at equipping State agencies
      with the knowledge needed to improve their own specific causes of payment error.
      This is critical since each State agency will vary in terms of causes of error
      and approaches/options to reduce error. At a higher level, the Keys to Payment
      Accuracy also provide additional, updated guidance on how State agencies can

    act17_3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) continues to place an emphasis in
      assisting State agencies in conducting robust root causes of error analysis
      and in providing tools to assist states with this analysis. Training and guidance
      will be implemented with the assistance of FNS regional offices and prioritized
      by leadership at all levels of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) but specific implementation details will vary based on the training and
      guidance needed. Both the Keys to Payment Accuracy and grants for third party
