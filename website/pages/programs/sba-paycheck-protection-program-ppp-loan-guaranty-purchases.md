  cyp8: In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit conducted by OIG, the SBA
    separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
    PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases, and subsequently initiated the improper payments
    review process shortly after. SBA generated the loan sample and requested supporting
    documentation from lenders. In many instances, PPP loans guaranty purchase requests
    were submitted via SBA’s PPP platform and, although the lenders were required
    to retain supporting documentation, they were not required to submit that documentation
    to SBA.  SBA requested documentation from lenders for those guaranty purchases
    that were a part of the sample, with the added instruction to submit the documentation
    as soon as possible. As a result of the compressed time between documentation
    requests and reporting improper payment rates, many lenders were unable to provide
    complete documentation. Those PPP loans with documentation requests outstanding
    were categorized as “Unknown” payments since SBA did not have sufficient supporting
    documentation to make a determination as to whether the guaranty purchase payments
    were proper or improper.

    keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Funding for
    this program ended in 2021, with no new funds advanced.  As PPP loan guaranties
    are purchased, outstanding PPP loans will eventually be reduced to a nominal amount.
    Because of this, no tolerable rate has been established.

  act17_1: Demanding repayment from the lender is the first step in the recovery process.  To
    recover PPP Loan Guaranty improper payments, the SBA will use processes similar
    to the process used for its 7(a) guaranty purchase portfolio, which begin with
    demanding repayment from the lender.
  act17_2: Effective corrective actions address the root cause of the overpayments.  The
    predominate reasons for improper payments in PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases were
    (1) lender’s failure to verify that the borrower was in business on February 20,
    2020; lender’s failure to verify average monthly payroll; and, unacceptable or
    missing identification of the borrower.  To recover the SBA will use processes
    similar to the process used for its 7(a) guaranty purchase portfolio, which begin
    with demanding repayment from the lender.
  act17_3: Effective corrective actions address the root cause of the overpayments.  The
    predominate reasons for improper payments in PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases were

  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: SBA has set a reduction target for PPP Loan Guaranty Purchase  at 10.0
    percent, the statutory limit, for FY2025.  Meeting this reduction target will
    also bring this program into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information

    cyp2_1: PPP Loan Guaranty Purchase payments are reviewed after the guaranty has
      been paid to the lender.   Borrower and lender documentation is reviewed to
      determine whether the lender is eligible, and whether the amount of guaranty
      purchase request equaled the amount in SBA systems.  SBA also verifies that
      the lender received borrower certifications, including whether the borrower
      had been in business on or around February 20, 2020.  SBA also checked that
      the eligible payroll was accurately accounted for.
