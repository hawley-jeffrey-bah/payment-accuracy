    funds awarded to existing COVID-EIDL applicants who meet certain eligibility criteria.  The
    EIDL Advances are similar to grants (without the typical requirements for grants)
    and are not required to be repaid.  There are two forms of EIDL Advances, Targeted
    EIDL Advance and Supplemental Targeted Advance.  Targeted EIDL Advance provides
    up to $10,000 to eligible low-income applicants that met specific program eligibility
    criteria.  Supplemental Targeted Advance provides $5,000 to eligible low-income
    applicants that meet specific program eligibility criteria and does not need to
    be repaid.
