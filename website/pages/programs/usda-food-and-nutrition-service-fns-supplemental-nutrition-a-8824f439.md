  rap5: "The following barriers apply to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\
    \ (SNAP) program: \n\nSNAP benefits are processed and administered by State agencies,\
    \ with FNS oversight. State policy options, organizational structures, and use\
    \ of technology vary from State to State, resulting in different root causes contributing\
    \ to payment errors. The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, provides\
    \ disincentives in the form of financial penalties to encourage States to accurately\
    \ issue SNAP benefits and maintain low improper payment rates. The liability process\

    \ FNS has a regulatory process that requires States to enter into corrective actions\
    \ at the State level to address payment error rates that exceed six percent, a\
    \ standard established by law. FNS provides oversight and technical assistance,\
    \ to States in measuring and reporting improper payments. Because FNS does not\

  pro1: "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will not issue an error\
    \ rate for FY 2021 due to a lack of information. Specifically, COVID-19 related\
    \ flexibilities provided to the State agencies that administer SNAP, and provisions\
    \ in both 2021 continuing appropriations acts (P.L. 116-159 and 116-260), suspended\
    \ the quality control system SNAP uses to collect error rate data for significant\
    \ portions of FY 2020 and FY 2021. Quality control activities have resumed for\
    \ FY 2022 and as a Phase 2 program, SNAP will submit official improper payment\
    \ rates in 2023.\nAlthough SNAP is unable to report an improper payment estimate\
    \ for the current reporting year, certain payment integrity activities continue,\
    \ including the following:\nThere are a number of recovery-related activities\
    \ to identify and recover overpayments. Recipient claims are established against\
    \ households that receive more Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\
    \ benefits than they are entitled to receive or households that have trafficked\
    \ benefits (exchanged for cash). According to section 13(b) of The Food and Nutrition\
    \ Act of 2008, States must collect all over- issuances of SNAP benefits. SNAP\
    \ regulations at 7 CFR 273.18(b) require State agencies to develop plans to establish\
    \ and collect on claims. State agencies use various methods to collect claims.\
    \ The two primary methods are allotment reduction and the Federal debt collection\
    \ programs such as the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Allotment reduction is when\
    \ the household’s benefits are reduced each month to collect the claim. Allotment\
    \ reduction is the primary collection method for households that continue to participate\
    \ in SNAP. \nState agencies refer delinquent claims to the TOP. This is the most\
    \ effective collection method for households that no longer participate in SNAP.\
    \ TOP intercepts Federal payments to individuals. The sources for these offsets\
    \ vary but currently they are primarily from Federal income tax refunds and Federal\
    \ salaries. \nOther methods of collection include but are not limited to: lump\
    \ sum and installment payments, wage garnishments, unemployment compensation benefit\
    \ intercepts, and State income tax refund and lottery winnings. \nIn order to\
    \ monitor and oversee State agency management and operations of SNAP, FNS regional\
    \ office staff conduct Management Evaluations and Financial Management Reviews\
    \ each year to ensure State and local agencies are complying with Federal regulations\
    \ and using funds for intended purposes. Data gathered through this process provides\
    \ a basis for assessing the administration of FNS programs and planning future\
    \ management objectives. With this information, FNS can identify the types, frequency,\
    \ and scope of problems that are occurring and target resources to correcting\
    \ the problems. \nFNS regional offices conduct Recipient Claims Management Evaluation\
    \ Reviews (RCMERs) which examine a State agency’s or local SNAP office’s operations\
    \ to determine compliance with Federal SNAP requirements governing establishment\
    \ and collection of SNAP claims. The review focuses on recipient claim establishment\
    \ activities, including recoupment and collection, TOP procedures, and quality\
    \ control error review.\nAlthough SNAP will not issue a payment error rate for\
    \ FY 2021, because legislation related to the COVID-19 public health emergency\
    \ suspended the QC system for significant portions of the year, other oversight\
    \ activities such as management evaluations, technical assistance, and CAPS continue.\
    \ \nOne example of technical assistance conducted in FY 2021 to help prevent improper\
    \ payments and ensure those that do occur are promptly detected and recovered\
    \ involved verification of household earned income. State agencies are required\
    \ to verify a household’s gross non-exempt income prior to certification in all\
    \ cases. States typically meet this requirement for earned income, a common top\
    \ driver of errors year to year, by requesting that the household provide documentary\
    \ evidence such as pay stubs. In addition, many States consult a third-party income\
    \ database to request documentation of the household's income. In FY 2021, FNS\
    \ provided grants to 16 States to evaluate best practices and effects of State\
    \ SNAP agency usage of commercially available third-party income databases to\
    \ verify household earned income. States participated in interviews and submitted\
    \ two datasets designed to systematically measure variations in usage and impacts.\
    \ FNS is still reviewing that data."

      of policy guidance. In FY 2023, FNS conducted a root cause analysis training
      series that provided training to State agencies on how to conduct a root cause
      analysis using FNS-provided and widely available tools (such as Excel). The
      series featured policy staff at FNS that explored different policy responses
      and resources available to address root causes of payment error. Several State
      agencies presented throughout the series on approaches they took and the results
      they saw. All sessions offered a question and answer component as well, allowing
      State agencies to ask questions tailored to their situation. FNS also developed
      tools to assist with conducting root cause analysis by State agencies, created
      dashboards for FNS to better identify State agencies struggling with payment
      errors, and issued guidance to State agencies on improving verification procedures
      and developing corrective action plans. FNS verification guidance documents
      related to income verification sources and using information received from other
      public assistance programs. FNS also provided significant guidance and technical
      assistance to assist States in managing the transition from COVID-19 related
      administrative flexibilities back to normal processes while keeping a focus
      on payment accuracy.

    cyp4_1: Overpayments related to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
      are outside of FNS' control because SNAP benefits are processed and administered
      by State agencies. FNS provides State agencies with guidance related to eligibility
      determinations, provides oversight and technical assistance to States, and measures
      and reports improper payments. State agencies make decisions about how to administer
      the program amongst various policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects;
      directly determines eligibility for SNAP; and provides benefits to recipients.
      Therefore, FNS must work with its State agency partners to measure, monitor,
      and address improper payments.

    structures, and use of technology vary from State to State. FNS provides oversight
    and technical assistance to States in measuring and reporting improper payments.
    Because FNS does not provide benefits directly to recipients, the Program must
    work through its State administering agencies to measure, monitor, and address
    improper payments and is not positioned to determine or control each State agency's
    internal controls, human capital, or information systems.

    \ provide technical support to State agencies as they implement corrective actions\
    \ to ensure the root causes being addressed are properly targeted. \n\nIn addition,\
    \ FNS has contracted for support to help update the Keys to Payment Accuracy,\

    \ to address variations in SNAP administration across all 53 SNAP State and Territorial\
    \ agencies. \n\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, FNS will provide third-party income\
    \ verification services for all State SNAP agencies. Errors related to earned\
    \ income regularly account for the top three causes of error nationally and within\
    \ State agencies. This is expected to provide States with improved resources to\
    \ accurately determine income for the SNAP benefit calculation. FNS plans to make\
    \ an official announcement about the vendor(s) awarded the contract in October\

  act17_1: In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) conducted
    additional training and provided resources aimed at equipping State agencies with
    the knowledge needed to improve their own specific causes of payment error. This
    is critical since each State agency will vary in terms of causes of error and
    approaches/options to reduce error. At a higher level, the Keys to Payment Accuracy
    also provide additional, updated guidance on how State agencies can improve payment
    accuracy. Additionally, by providing grants for third-party income verification
    resources to all State agencies, FNS is addressing a common cause of payment errors
    in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) related to accurate income
    determinations in the financial criteria element.
  act17_2: "Since the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is administered\
    \ by State agencies, who also determine the structure of SNAP amongst numerous\
    \ policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects, corrective actions must\
    \ originate in and be tailored to each individual State agency's circumstances\
    \ and particular root cause of payment error. As such, the Food and Nutrition\
    \ Service (FNS) is primarily focused on providing training and equipping State\
    \ agencies with the knowledge and tools needed to individually develop meaningful\
    \ root cause analysis and corrective action plans, including through the issuance\
    \ of policy guidance. By equipping all 53 State agencies with the ability to identify\
    \ root causes of error and develop corrective action plans, FNS is adequately\
    \ supporting  efforts in improving payment accuracy. The Keys to Payment Accuracy\
    \ are a critical resource for States that has proved beneficial over the years\
    \ and the updates to this document will ensure its continued usefulness. Additionally,\
    \ third party income verification grants directly target certain income-based\
    \ payment errors. \n"
  act17_3: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) continues to place an emphasis in
    assisting State agencies in conducting robust root causes of error analysis and
    in providing tools to assist states with this analysis. Training and guidance
    will be implemented with the assistance of FNS regional offices and prioritized
    by leadership at all levels of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
    but specific implementation details will vary based on the training and guidance
    needed. Both the Keys to Payment Accuracy and grants for third party income verification
    systems will be implemented following a specific communications and implementation
    strategy for each.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: "The CY+1 improper payment targeted reduction rate is based on available\
    \ state reported data for the in-progress program year. This is based on the best\
    \ available data at the time. While the state provided data shows a downward trend\
    \ for the improper payment rate, historically the improper payment rate based\
    \ on state and federal data is greater than the rate based on state data alone.\
    \ The agency therefore gives a more conservative estimate of 11 percent. \n"

    cyp4_1: Overpayments related to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
      are outside of the Food and Nutrition Service's control because SNAP benefits
      are processed and administered by State agencies. FNS provides State agencies
      with guidance related to eligibility determinations, provides oversight and
      technical assistance to States, and measures and reports improper payments.
      State agencies make decisions about how to administer the program amongst various
      policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects; directly determines eligibility
      for SNAP; and provides benefits to recipients. Therefore, FNS must work with
      its State agency partners to measure, monitor, and address improper payments.
  rap5: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are processed and
    administered by State agencies, with Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversight.
    State policy options, organizational structures, and use of technology vary from
    State to State. FNS provides oversight and technical assistance to States in measuring
    and reporting improper payments. Because FNS does not provide benefits directly
    to recipients, the Program must work through its State administering agencies
    to measure, monitor, and address improper payments and is not positioned to determine
    or control each State agency's internal controls, human capital, or information
    systems.
  rap6: "The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has not determined a tolerable rate\
    \ for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n"
  rnp3: "\"The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will continue to conduct training\
    \ to assist State agencies in identifying the specific corrective actions needed\
    \ to address the root causes of error found in their States. FNS will also utilize\
    \ its payment error report and dashboard tools to provide technical support to\
    \ State agencies as they implement corrective actions to ensure the root causes\
    \ being addressed are properly targeted. \n\nIn addition, FNS has updated the\
    \ Keys to Payment Accuracy, a document for State Supplemental Nutrition Assistance\
    \ Program (SNAP) administering agencies on key strategies for improving payment\
    \ accuracy. As part of the development of the update, FNS focused on solutions\
    \ that incorporate caseload size and administrative characteristics to address\
    \ variations in SNAP administration across all 53 SNAP State and Territorial agencies.\
    \ \n\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, FNS provided non-competitive grants for third\
    \ party income verification services for all State SNAP agencies based on state\
    \ population size. Errors related to earned income regularly account for the top\
    \ three causes of error nationally and within State agencies. These third party\
    \ income verification services provide States with improved resources to accurately\
    \ determine income for the SNAP benefit calculation. FNS  awarded the contract\
    \ in October 2023 and then made the income verification resource available to\
    \ all States shortly thereafter. \""
  rnp4: The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, as amended, provides disincentives in
    the form of financial penalties to encourage States to accurately issue Supplemental
    Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and maintain low improper payment
    rates. The liability process to establish financial penalties against State agencies
    is statutory. In addition, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has a regulatory
    process that requires States to enter into corrective actions at the State level
    to address payment error rates that exceed six percent, a standard established
    by law.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Prgoram (SNAP) benefits are processed
    and administered by State agencies, with Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversight.
    State policy options, organizational structures, and use of technology vary from
    State to State, resulting in different root causes contributing to payment errors.
    FNS provides oversight and technical assistance to States in measuring and reporting
    improper payments. Because FNS does not provide benefits directly to recipients,
    the Program must work through its State administering agencies to measure, monitor,
    and address improper payments. As a result of this statutory structure, establishing
    a tolerable rate that would apply to each State agency has proved difficult.

Description: SNAP provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their
  grocery budgets. It is the largest domestic nutrition assistance program. SNAP is
  a Federal program administered by States (All 50 States, D.C., Guam, and the Virgin
  Islands). States are responsible for determining a SNAP applicant's eligibility
  and issuing benefits to eligible residents following Federal requirements. Within
  those requirements, State agencies have flexibility to tailor the program to meet
  the needs of their residents through various policy options, waivers, and demonstration
  projects. As a result, corrective actions to address payment errors must originate
  in and be tailored to each individual State agency's circumstances/particular root
  cause of error.
