    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program does
      not have a formal corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on current
      year findings. Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the
      Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual
      improper payments plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the
      current reporting year, the Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program reported
      an estimated total of $96.29 million of improper plus unknown payments, which
      is only 0.04 percent of the total outlays. Hence, no specific corrective actions
      were taken for this program. The Department pursues continuous training actions
      for current and new employees throughout the Commercial Pay MOCAS program. Additionally,
      through trend and root cause analysis, specific training is provided to prevent
      improper payments from technician error. For root causes other than technician
      error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault (i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana
      detection tool is continually monitored and evaluated to rank and rate proposed
      integrity checks to identify and prevent improper payments in the pre-payment
      environment.

    rnp4: 'Within the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), all Commercial
      Pay operations are responsible for tracking OMB metrics, proper payment count
      and dollars. Metrics are tracked monthly and updates are provided to the Director
      of DFAS at least three times per year. A green rating for this metric is greater
      than or equal to 99.6%, yellow is less than 99.6% and greater than or equal
      to 99.0% and red is less than 99.0%. Management must provide narratives and/or
      Corrective Action Plans for Red and Yellow ratings. At the operational level,
      entitlement technicians are held accountable through appraisal standards which
      limit them to no more than 5 errors per quarter, certifying official appraisal
      standards hold them to no more than 1% of payments certified during the rating
      period identified as improper. In addition, certifying officials have pecuniary
      liability for loss of funds unless relieved. Managers have overall responsibility
      to ensure metric targets are met and maintained.


      Furthermore, the Department of Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable
      Officials Steering Committee (the Committee) was created in FY 2018, and it
      institutionalized a forum of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s
      actions required by Appendix C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full
      compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee
      is chaired by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy
      Chief Financial Officer and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting
      Service, Deputy Director of Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service
      representatives from the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The Committee
      provides oversight to the DoD Payment Integrity program and drives action for
      compliance with the PIIA. More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status
      of improper payments testing, the root causes of improper payments and appropriate
      actions to reduce them, payment recovery activities, and solutions to resolve
      DoD-wide audit findings and recommendations related to improper payments. Additionally,
      the Committee supports audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations,
      performance of risk assessments and oversees the identification of root cause(s)
      and the development and implementation of corrective actions to address areas
      of noncompliance.'

    act17_2: The Department's Commercial Pay MOCAS program did not have a formal corrective
      action plan based on current year findings. Specifically, corrective action
      plans are required under the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)
      when a program's total annual improper payments plus unknown payments exceed
      the statutory threshold. In the current reporting year, the Department's Commercial
      Pay program reported a total of $96.3 million in improper plus unknown payments,
      which is below the statutory threshold.
    act17_3: 'Although below the statutory threshold, the $96 million in improper
      and unknown payments made by the Department under the Commercial Pay - MOCAS
      program should be preventable based on the following processes and controls:
      (1) The agency contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the
      payment terms are entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification
      is received; (2) The agency is also responsible for verifying the accuracy of
      the payment, to include payment terms, prior to release; (3) Requiring that
      prior to payment, entitlement technicians complete a review of the contract
      and supporting documentation; (4) A procedure is in place for any payments greater
      than $1 million to undergo secondary review to ensure entitlements are legal,
      proper, and correct; and (5) The contract input team utilizes a daily report
      to track contracts and modifications received to ensure timely input into the
      system. The above controls are being reviewed to determine how they can be strengthened
      and if additional training or controls are needed.

      MOCAS program are being reviewed to determine how they can be strengthened and
      if additional training or controls are needed to address potential deficiencies.
      DFAS Post Pay Review & Analysis team will provide training to review teams regarding
      proper documentation required for government credit card transactions. This
      Training will be provided to the review teams during the annual kick off meeting
      on the appropriate documentation required to complete sample packages along
      with specific examples of acceptable documentation. Additionally, through trend
      and root cause analysis, specific training will be provided to prevent technician
      error improper payments. In cases when the root cause is for other than technician
      error, the issue will be addressed with the applicable party at fault i.e.,
      contracting personal, receiving entities and systemic controls.

    rap5: 'Internal Controls:

      The Department has the internal controls in place to support the reduction of
      improper payments in the Commercial Pay – MOCAS program to the levels the Department
      has targeted. However, a material weakness in Contract Administration related
      to improper payments was reported in fiscal year (FY) 2021 through the Risk
      Management/Internal Control Program. Moreover, the Office of the Under Secretary
      of the Defense (Comptroller) provides ongoing oversight to ensure material weaknesses
      are resolved by their target dates and coordination continues between the Risk
      Management/Internal Control Program and the Payment Integrity Program to leverage
      best practices in internal controls.


      Human Capital:

      The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in
      the Commercial Pay – MOCAS program to the levels the Department has targeted.
      However, as the Commercial Pay -MOCAS program evolves and DoD operations change,
      additional skill sets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance
      the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Department has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs
      to reduce improper payments in the Commercial Pay - MOCAS program to the levels
      the Department has targeted. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)
      Contract Pay, received an unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC)
      1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE)
      No. 18 in FY 2024. The general and application controls of the Mechanization
      of Contract Administration Services System (which accounts for more than 50%
      of the outlays of all Commercial Pay programs) were included in the scope of
      the DFAS Contract Pay SSAE No. 18 examination. As technology advances, the Department
      continues to consider ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency of commercial
      pay through implementation of new commercial and entitlement processing systems
      and enhancements to existing systems.'
    rap6: The MOCAS Commercial Pay program did not have any recent specific Payment
      Integrity budget submissions that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
      (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team is aware. Furthermore, the Department is
      not aware outside the normal system upgrade requirements that will require additional
      resources.

    cyp2_1: The Department’s Payment Integrity Commercial Pay – Mechanization of Contract
      Administration Services (MOCAS) program focuses on commercial vendors who deliver
      goods to or perform services for the DoD. The Department’s contractual payments
      require a three-way match between contract, invoice, and goods receipt and acceptance.
      Through internal controls and prepayment authorizations, overpayments are usually
      prevented. The Department's overpayments within the agency control under the
      Commercial Pay – MOCAS program in FY 2024 were mainly attributed to human input
      error. During the FY 2024 post-payment reviews of the program, it was found
      that payment terms were entered incorrectly into MOCAS when contract modifications
      were implemented. These overpayments are classified as within agency control
      because the contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the payment
      terms are entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification
      is received. The contract input team is also responsible for verifying the accuracy
      of the payment, to include payment terms, prior to release. The Department has
      several controls in place to prevent overpayments from occurring, including
      requiring that prior to payment, entitlement technicians complete a review of
      the contract and supporting documentation.  In addition, a procedure is in place
      for any payments greater than $1 million to undergo secondary review to ensure
      entitlements are legal, proper, and correct.  The contract input team also utilizes
      a daily report to track contracts and modifications received to ensure timely
      input into the system.  The above controls that failed are being reviewed to
      determine how they can be strengthened and to determine if additional training
      or controls are needed.
