  pro1: "The Grants payment stream is not susceptible to significant improper payments\
    \ reaching that status during FY 2022.  For the Agency’s grants payment stream,\
    \ overpayments principally consist of unallowable costs or lack of supporting\
    \ documentation. When overpayments arise, EPA seeks to recover them either by\
    \ establishing a receivable and collecting money from the recipient or by offsetting\
    \ future payment requests. The Agency follows established debt collection procedures\
    \ to recapture overpayments. \n. EPA also seeks to prevent improper payments.\
    \ Prior to the issuance of a grant award, OGD’s Compliance Team conduct pre-award\
    \ certification of non-profit recipients that receive awards in excess of $200K\
    \ to ensure their written policies and procedures specify acceptable internal\
    \ controls for safeguarding federal funds. Re-certifications are conducted every\
    \ four years. Grants Management Officers (GMOs) concur on all certifications."

  act17_1: The agency is taking a two-pronged approach. One is improved training and
    information among agency staff. This addresses errors that new, inexperienced
    staff. The other is making agency staff regular available for live Q & A sessions
    increases the understanding of grant recipients in etermining the appropriate
    timing of their grant draws.
  act17_2: The Grants program is no longer considered susceptible to significant improper
    payments. While some additional improvements are planned for this coming fiscal
    year, no extraordinary efforts are necessary.
  act17_3: The Corrective Actions requirements are included in mandatory trainings
    and are reviewed at monthly staff meetings.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: We anticipate a modest improvement in Improper Payment and Unknown Payment
    rates due additional staff training and enhance Project Officer outreach to grantees.

    cyp4_1: "For the agency's Grants program, overpayments occur when a recipient\
      \ erroneously overdraws funds in advance of immediate cash needs or uses funds\
      \ for unallowable costs. \nThe EPA seeks to prevent improper payments through\
      \ mechanisms such as:  (Prior to the issuance of a grant award,) the agency’s\
      \ Compliance Team conduct pre-award certification of non-profit recipients that\
      \ receive awards in excess of $200K to ensure their written policies and procedures\
      \ specify acceptable internal controls for safeguarding federal funds. Re-certifications\
      \ are conducted every four years. Grants Management Officers (GMOs) concur on\
      \ all certifications. EPA conducts annual baseline monitoring reviews of all\
      \ recipients to ensure overall compliance with assistance agreement terms and\
      \ conditions, as well as all applicable federal regulations. If deemed necessary,\
      \ recipients can be placed on a reimbursement payment plan which requires submission\
      \ of cost documentation (receipts, invoices, etc.) for review and approval prior\
      \ to receiving reimbursement."
  pro1: The agency's Office of the Controller recently completed a reorganization
    that put the agency's Program Integrity and Payment Integrity functions with additional
    staff in their own branch.
  rap5: No additional resources have been requested. Some relevant staffing requirements
    have not been brought on board yet or some positions are still in the announcement
    phase.
  rap6: No new payment integrity resources have been requested.
  rnp3: 'The agency anticipates the steps taken in FY 2024 along with the planned
    activities in the forthcoming fiscal year will be adequate. As the agency Grants
    Program has a combined improper payment questioned cost rate below the 1.5% threshold
    rate, no additional efforts are planned.

    How the corrective action plan affects "unknown payments" is not certain because
    the agency did not have any this year.'
  rnp4: No addition measurers are required as this program has been determined through
    a statistically valid sample of the agency grants payments as no longer likely
    to be susceptible to significant improper payments.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency does not have adequate data to determine that the IPs and UPs
    have hit a plateau. The agency expects it will take at least two more years of
    consistent results.
