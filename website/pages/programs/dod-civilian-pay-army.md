    Description_Action_Taken: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed
      civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are
      signed by their Command partners. The reason this is still causing technically
      improper payments is that the employee’s current three to five year tour includes
      prior year SF1190s that are not being properly signed.

    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: The corrective action was not fully completed this reporting
      period
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The majority of the technically improper and unknown
      payments were due to Standard Form (SF) 1190s with missing authorizing signatures.
      SF-1190s substantiate overseas entitlements like the Living Quarters Allowance
      and the Foreign Post Allowance. The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency
      (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure
      that block 25 of SF-1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses and block 26
      on all SF-1190 forms are signed by their Command partners. This is a requirement
      aligned with the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation Volume
      8, Chapter 3, subparagraph 4.1.1.  This mandate will prevent overseas entitlements
      from paying out to an employee without a properly signed SF1190; thus, substantially
      reducing (if not eliminating), technically improper and unknown payments in
      the coming years.


      Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated
      with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review
      and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with Command partners to resolve
      discrepancies as they are identified.

  act17_1: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
    offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
    partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is that
    the employee’s current three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s that
    not being properly signed. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will
    be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA
    will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with Command
    partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified.
  act17_2: A strong indicator of the adequateness of the planned corrective actions
    is they align with prior efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments. Specifically,
    the Army’s portion of the previous Department wide Civilian Pay program prior
    to the FY 2024 restructure was $108.57 million in FY 2023. In FY 2024 the restructured
    Army Civilian Pay program successfully reduced improper and unknown payments by
    $61.62 million down to $46.95 million. It is through this significant reduction
    in improper payments and subsequent ending amounts which are below the OMB statutory
    threshold that the Department is confident in the Army’s Civilian Pay corrective
    actions planned based off prior success.
  act17_3: The actions planned are only required for programs reporting an improper
    plus unknown payment estimate exceeding the statutory threshold. In the current
    reporting year, the Civilian Pay – Army program reported a total of $46.95 million
    in improper plus unknown payments, which is below the statutory threshold. Hence,
    no specific corrective actions are planned to be taken for this program. Furthermore,
    the Department anticipates the Civilian Pay - Army program to automatically move
    to Phase 1 in FY 2025 after achieving PIIA compliance. The U.S. Army Civilian
    Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that all
    Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command partners. The reason this
    is still causing technically improper payments is that the employee’s current
    three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s that not being properly signed.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Department’s Payment Integrity program - Army Civilian Pay’s reduction
    target is less than the estimated future Improper Payment and Unknown Payment
    rate. Currently the Army Civilian Pay estimated rate is $46.95 million which is
    substantially lower than the OMB statutory threshold and is expected to remain
    underneath the allowable $100 million in projected improper and unknown payment
    projections. The Department is confident in the Army’s ability to continue their
    progress in ensuring that the appropriate forms are fully signed and readily available
    going forward.

  cyp6_1: The technically improper payment errors for Army were caused by payments
    received from improperly signed Standard Forms (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances
    Application, Grant and Report” that are required to authorize the payment(s) for
    submission into the payroll system for processing.  The employees were all entitled
    to receive the payments; however, because the SF1190 was not signed by all required
    parties, the payment was improper.  From the Department of Defense (DoD) Financial
    Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 8 , Chapter 3 in subparagraph 4.1.1, “Foreign
    differentials and allowances are paid upon receipt through the interface of a
    properly completed and signed SF 1190, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant,
    and Report.” In 2021, at the direction of senior leadership in Human Resource,
    SF1190s did not require all signatures because the information was being sent
    from the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) system to the payroll system.  This
    guidance was not accurate and could not be authorized because it was not in alignment
    with DoD FMR Volume 8 “Civilian Pay Policy.”

  cyp7_ucp4_1: The Army’s civilian unknown payments are very similar in nature to
    the technically improper payment errors for Army and were caused by payments received
    from an improperly signed Standard Form (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances Application,
    Grant and Report” that were sent to the payroll system for payment but also were
    missing additional key supporting documentation (KSD) required to authorize and
    substantiate these payment types.  The employees were all entitled to receive
    the payments, however technically, because the SF1190 was not signed by all required
    parties, the payment is improper.  From the DoD Financial Management Regulation
    (DoD FMR) Volume Civilian Pay Policy. Foreign Area. Allowances and differentials
    payable to employees officially stationed in foreign areas are established by
    the Secretary of State and published in the Department of State Standardized Regulations
    (DSSR). See Title 5 U.S. Code Sections 5921-5928. The DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1400.25-V1250
    sets forth additional rules regarding foreign allowances and differentials for
    DoD civilian employees. Foreign differentials and allowances are paid upon receipt
    through the interface of a properly completed and signed SF 1190, Foreign Allowances
    Application, Grant, and Report.  In 2021, at the direction of senior leadership
    in the Army Human Resource Command (HRC), SF1190s did not require all signatures
    because the information was being sent from the HR system to the payroll system.  This
    guidance was not accurate and could not be authorized because it was not in alignment
    with the DoD FMR Volume Civilian Pay Policy.  The missing KSD for these errors
    were specifically missing the  Travel Orders authorizing the location and subsequently
    the Living Quarter Allowance amounts.  Travel Orders contain the location of the
    Duty Station.
  cyp8: The Army’s unknown payments are very similar in nature to the technically
    improper payment errors for Army and were caused by payments received from an
    improperly signed Standard Form (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances Application, Grant
    and Report” that were sent to the payroll system for payment but also were missing
    additional key supporting documentation (KSD) required to authorize and substantiate
    these payment types.  The employees were all entitled to receive the payments,
    however technically, because the SF1190 was not signed by all required parties,
    the payment is improper.  From the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR)
    Volume Civilian Pay Policy. Foreign Area. Allowances and differentials payable
    to employees officially stationed in foreign areas are established by the Secretary
    of State and published in the Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR).

    cyp2: '0.5'
    cyp2_1: The overpayments annotated as ‘Monetary Loss within Agency Control’ (MLA)
      are within the  Army’s control because the root cause of the overpayments is
      the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) processing the incorrect information on
      standard HRC personnel actions on the Standard Form (SF); specifically, the
      Standard Form (SF) 50, “Notification of Personnel Action” and/or the SF1190,
      “Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report” required to authorize the
      payment(s).  In many of these cases a retroactive personnel action can be processed
      to correct the employees pay record and recoup the over payments.  The Army
      can avoid this type of overpayment by ensuring the information on the SF50 and/or
      SF1190 contain the accurate pay information and personal information prior to
      sending the information to the payroll system for payment.  The root cause is
      human error through the lack of attention to detail when reviewing the personnel
      actions.  The Army prevents the majority of these similar errors by double checking
      the personnel actions and ensuring the appropriate signatures are on the required
      forms prior to sending to the payroll system.

  rap5: 'Internal Controls:

    The Army has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
    payments in its Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.
    Moreover, Federal Civilian Pay Service, which support the end-to-end delivery
    of payroll processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational
    Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements
    (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2024.


    Human Capital:

    The Army has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Civilian
    Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as the Army’s
    Civilian Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
    and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


    Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

    The Army has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
    improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has
    targeted. However, as technology advances, the Army and the Department continue
    to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian Pay. Lastly, the Automated
    Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing
    System (which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department) received
    an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2024.

    '
  rap6: The Army's Civilian Pay Payment Integrity program has not had any specific
    or known additional resources requested in their most recent budget submission.
    Furthermore, the ongoing corrective actions are cost beneficial and relatively
    straightforward to implement to ensure the proper signatures are on the appropriate
    and relevant forms.
  rnp3: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
    offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
    partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is that
    the employee’s current three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s that
    not being properly signed. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will
    be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA
    will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with Command
    partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified. Another strong indicator
    of the effectiveness of the planned corrective actions is they align with prior
    efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments. Specifically, the Army’s portion
    of the previous Department wide Civilian Pay program prior to the FY 2024 restructure
    was $108.57 million in FY 2023. In FY 2024 the restructured Army Civilian Pay

    and subsequent ending amounts which are below the OMB statutory threshold that
    the Department is confident in the Army’s Civilian Pay corrective actions planned
    based off prior success.
  rnp4: The Department of Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials Steering
    Committee (the Committee) was created in FY 2018, and it institutionalized a forum
    of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required by Appendix
    C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with the Payment
    Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired by the Office
    of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial Officer
    and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy Director
    of Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives from
    the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The Committee provides oversight to
    the DoD Payment Integrity program and drives action for compliance with the PIIA.
    More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of improper payments testing,
    the root causes of improper payments and appropriate actions to reduce them, payment
    recovery activities, and solutions to resolve DoD-wide audit findings and recommendations
    related to improper payments. Additionally, the Committee supports audits related
    to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations, performance of risk assessments
    and oversees the identification of root cause(s) and the development and implementation
    of corrective actions to address areas of noncompliance.
