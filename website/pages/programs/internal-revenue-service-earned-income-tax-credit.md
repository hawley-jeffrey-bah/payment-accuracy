  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: Much of the difficulty administering refundable tax
      credits derives from the complexity of its statutory eligibility requirements,
      and much of the related information is known only to the taxpayer and cannot
      be independently confirmed using third-party corroborating data. The primary
      root causes of improper payments of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are
      the the inability to authenticate eligibility at return filing because the data
      needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment
      income and other income where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third
      party. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing
      with other federal agencies and outreach/education to aid the Service in focusing
      their efforts in mitigating the impact of these root causes.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in the Wage & Investment, Small Business &
      Self Employed, and IT divisions, with the goal of increasing voluntary taxpayer
      compliance, to evaluate the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit
      selection of (1) the inability to authenticate eligibility; (2) taxpayer income
      misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where the income
      is not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (3) the many taxpayers who
      claim and receive EITC for the first time, who have to understand and apply
      the complex eligibility requirements. The IRS will analyze returns claiming
      the EITC and identify improvement opportunities for next filing season.

      to various interagency agreements, e.g., Department of Health and Human Services
      (HHS) Office of Child Support enforcement (OCSE), and the Social Security Administration
      (SSA), to more accurately validate refunds entitled to a taxpayer; thus, allowing
      the IRS to enforce laws passed by Congress more effectively.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS
      refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods
      of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the
      process. As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit
      management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper
      payments are reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and
      the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove
      their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional)
      can occur. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.
      The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas
      in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts
      to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer
      outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits.
      By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that
      delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which
      they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially
      increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Earned
      Income Tax Credit (EITC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next
      filing season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune
      criteria used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from
      prior filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters,
      the IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and
      prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned,

      on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval
      process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs
      upfront (as would be the case with a traditional payment program), errors can
      occur due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of
      eligibility. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.

    rnp3: The IRS runs various automated checks of certain data on a tax return before
      payment of a refund but is otherwise limited in its ability to question and
      correct the taxpayer’s claim. The IRS must deploy a variety of costly enforcement
      tools, including audits, to verify the information on the tax return and then
      prevent the payment of tax refunds or collect any tax due. As a result, the
      IRS allocates a disproportionate amount of its enforcement resources to audit
      returns that claim one or more RTCs. This creates several problems. Because
      lower-income taxpayers make up the majority of those claiming RTCs, they are
      subjected to a disproportionate number of audits (RTC claimants are audited
      at almost three times the rate of other taxpayers.) Since lower-income taxpayers
      make up a significant portion of taxpayers claiming RTCs, auditing these taxpayers
      can lead to a negative perception of IRS’s treatment of taxpayers. This runs
      counter to the IRS’s mission of fairness to all taxpayers.

      The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is available.
      Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that RTC overclaims are largely
      attributable to the statutory design and complex eligibility requirements, and
      not rooted in internal control weaknesses, financial management deficiencies
      or reporting failures. The IRS has a strong internal control environment around
      refundable credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall
      cost-benefit considerations. The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable
      credits compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims.  Therefore, legislative
      changes are the most effective means of addressing the causes of these improper

    rnp3: The regulatory structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to include
      the lack of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification
      that tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of EITC improper payments.
      While the IRS has the ability to identify EITC errors by type, correlating remediation
      efforts to success is challenging. Given its limited authority to directly prevent
      and stop these errors, the IRS focuses on positively influencing taxpayer behavior
      and working with paid preparers and tax preparation software/online filing service
      providers. Further, the IRS has sought legislative authority to enhance verification
      procedures for taxpayers claiming EITC.
  2024:
    act17_1: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
      such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), is the complexity of the credits''
      statutory eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes of RTC
      improper payments are as follows: (1) the lack of a pre-approval process and
      inability to authenticate eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer
      misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility, especially
      for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties;
      and (3) the inability for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these
      root causes, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate
      return. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating
      these root causes. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing
      and adjusting compliance filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS
      to detect errors earlier. The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department
      of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA)
      and the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would
      enable the IRS to identify discrepancies in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS
      has invested in taxpayer education and outreach efforts, through such venues
      as the IRS''s Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax Fest, to educate tax preparers
      about their responsibilities to verify taxpayer eligibility before filing claims.
      The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly,
      the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting
      additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
      quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits
      and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
      issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.
      All of these corrective actions are strategically designed to address the root
      causes of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating
      the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
    act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks
      a pre-approval process and causes the IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification
      that their returns claiming RTCs are accurate, is a key factor contributing
      to RTC improper payments. Despite these constraints, the IRS has strategically
      designed corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments

      actions focused on mitigating these root causes. The IRS prioritizes its corrective
      actions based on the magnitude of the root causes they address and the potential
      impact of each action on reducing improper payments. Data-driven analyses are
      critical in determining which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning
      its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing
      in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund
      audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors
      that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for
      which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without
      substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. The IRS ensures
      that its corrective actions are continuously monitored, effectively implemented
      and reprioritized based on their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper
      payments.
    rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
      root causes of the Earned Income Tax Credit improper payments are as follows:
      (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability
      to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
      taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any
      third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the
      IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate.
      RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration
      and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of
      filing/payment: (a) there''s an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically
      due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency
      tests containing with many nuances); (b) there''s instances where taxpayer income
      is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income
      not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there''s a turnover of taxpayer
      who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex
      requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally
      does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of
      math authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes
      a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility
      rules compliance and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb)
      meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education
      efforts aid the Service in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly,
      the IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'
Description: 'The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for working
  families with low to moderate incomes.  Approximately $14.99B of overpayments are
  from the inability to authenticate qualifying child eligibility requirements and
  misreported taxpayer income.  Authentication is difficult because the IRS relies
  primarily on the self-reported information from the taxpayers and there is a lack
  of internal or external databases available with information that would help the
  IRS determine eligibility.  Approximately $0.96B of EITC overclaims are from program
  design limitations. Barriers caused by program design occur when information needed
  to confirm payment accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed.  '

    cyp20_2: 'The FY 2023 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2022
      Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
      target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments
      will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited authority
      to make changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most of the
      eligibility and credit determination requirements depends on factors that are
      not fundamentally known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies
      on taxpayer-provided information without verifiability by third-party

      sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around eligibility
      requirements and is one of the major contributing factors of improper payments.
      Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive
      examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources
      to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained
      through this process are small relative to the amount of improper payments estimated
      for the program. Without legislative change to greatly improve effective tools
      to administer these credits, the improper payment rate

      will not drastically change.'
    rap5: To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
      Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal
      Year 2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5
      billion to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment.
      If the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA,
      a substantial loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would
      result because the IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and
      tax gap elements to audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions
      would place substantial burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits
      and delayed refunds, violating the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law
      with integrity and fairness. As such, IRS has long held that focusing enforcement
      resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost effective way to
      minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We further support the reporting
      of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis to reflect better how the IRS
      approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.
    rap6: 'For FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its
      Budget submission:

      (1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers-

      The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide
      the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal
      tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.


      (2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – The
      proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance
      or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.
      First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers
      for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms
      of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal
      would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification
      Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for
      failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. Third, the proposal
      would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure
      to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years
      to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority to
      regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized

    rap5: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Earned Income Tax
      Credit (EITC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The
      issue with EITC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around EITC and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff. The Inspector General of Tax Administration (TIGTA) has
      traditionally reported that the issue with improper payments is not an internal
      control deficiency.
    rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
      its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number
      of correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits,
      including the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Focusing on helping taxpayers
      submit accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing
      administrative burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
    rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
      the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

    rap6: "The IRS has proposed various legislative changes over the years aimed at\
      \ providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget\
      \ submission, the Administration included the following proposals in its Budget\
      \ submission: \n\nA. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and\
      \ E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address\
      \ noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file\
      \ providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid\
      \ tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements,\
      \ as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement\
      \ of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation\
      \ of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\
      \ Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.\
      \  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the\
      \ penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be\
      \ assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify\
      \ the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons\
      \ who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards\
      \ and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\
      \nB. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend\
      \ Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit\
      \ authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including\
      \ by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory\
      \ changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
      \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data\
      \ sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and\
      \ additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not been determined.\
      \ It is important to note the Refundable Tax Credits (RTCs) do not have the\
      \ characteristics of a typical payment program. The primary root causes of improper\
      \ payments of RTCs are the inability to authenticate eligibility at return filing\
      \ because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting related\
      \ to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported\
      \ to the IRS by a third party. Put simply, payment eligibility and certification\
      \ decisions for RTCs are made by the taxpayer during the filing process. \n\n\
      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
      \ restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. \n\nAccordingly,\
      \ the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate."
