    Improper Payments are missing certifying signature on the key supporting documentation
    for the entitlement.
  cyp8: The Army Military Pay scenarios are broad and complex based upon the requirements
    to authorize an entitlement or deduction. For example, an unknown sample covering
    military pay and allowances, which could be for multiple reasons. After researching
    the unknown sample, the Soldier acquired a debt for being over-agent-in transit.
    Because of this, the debt was caused systematically generated, due to the late
    processing of the arrival finance transaction of the Soldier. The key supporting
    documents (KSDs) to resolve this error is the Soldier’s finance arrival packet
    (PCS orders, Leave Form, etc.,), which has been obtained. Army will continue to
    research the appropriate repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve
    these errors.

  rap6: The Department's Military Pay - Army program did not have any specific recent
    budget submission to assist in bringing the program into compliance that the Office
    of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team is aware.
  rnp3: 'The FY 2021 Corrective Action Plan (CAP) reassessed the errors identified
    to obtain the applicable key supporting document to the error to not improper.
    The actions implemented to obtain the applicable key supporting document included
    a Detailed review of the Soldier’s pay system, Finance repository (CEDMS) and
    the Army Personnel repository (iPERMS). Additionally, the Army coordinated with
    various Department Components such as DFAS, HRC, Office of the Surgeon General,
    Army Units/S-1s. These efforts improved our collection of applicable key supporting
    documents and we will continue to do so. The FY 2022 CAP includes coordination
    to establish a working group with Army G-1 agencies to improve efforts for Soldiers
    to validate their personnel record in iPERMS. This working group purpose is to
    identify the reasoning of Soldiers missing key supporting documents (KSDs) in
    their iPERMS and provide course of actions to improve the deficiency in accordance
    with Army Regulation 600-8-104.


    During the FY 2022 Military Pay Review, the majority error reason was the entitlement
    document was not provided. The Army personnel repository for Soldier''s records
    is IPERMS, where often times the KSD was not uploaded. Additionally, the coordination
    between DFAS ESS, DFAS FIN OPS, Army Reserve, National Guard, and Army HRC has
    improved tremendously, which has consistently decreased the Army Military Pay
    Improper Pay estimates and rates.'
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department
    can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently
    in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the previous
    Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate
    variable, which led to insufficient sample sizes and incomplete universe of transactions
    (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department
    has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
    for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans
    and creating a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
    of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
    Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved
    by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes
    by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and
    process is anticipated to produce more reliable estimates and streamline the Department’s
    efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance during
    the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has DoD OIG
    confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish effective
    and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

      from samples selected during post pay review of the program.  The error reason
      for the majority of the unknown payments was that entitlements were not uploaded
      to the Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management System (IPERMS),
      preventing the post-pay reviewer from determining whether the impacted payments
      were proper or improper.

    this occurs, the Army takes the appropriate steps based off of the Army regulations
    to correct the Soldier's pay record. The date of the corrected order/digital signatures

    and unit Human Resource professionals sometimes do not strictly adhere to the
    current Army regulations and policies regarding document retention or processing
    and uploading the finalized document to the Army repository. The key supporting
    documentation (KSD) must be stored in the proper repository (i.e. IPERMS) readily
    available for audit. The stakeholder’s inability to retain the paid entitlements
    KSDs in IPERMS causes the Military Pay- Army program's Improper Pay rate estimates
    to increase in fiscal year 2023.
  cyp8: The Military Pay- Army program scenarios are broad and complex based upon
    the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction. For example, an unknown
    sample covering military pay and allowances, which could be for multiple reasons.
    Military Pay - Army payments are identified as unknown due to appropriate/applicable
    key supporting documents (KSDs) not readily available to be reviewed.  The KSDs
    were not in the designated repositories. The Army will continue to research the
    appropriate repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve these errors.
