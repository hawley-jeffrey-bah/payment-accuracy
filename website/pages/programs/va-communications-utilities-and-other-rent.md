  cyp20_2: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent reduction target is equal
    to the estimated future improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes
    reduction targets by setting them lower than the current year improper payment
    estimates.  Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic.
    One thing VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with
    improper payments legislation is that it can take three years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '27.68000103'
  cyp6: '27.68'
  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, all laws and regulations were not followed.  Specifically, either the
    order was placed by an unauthorized individual or the contract was missing the
    proper signature, or a request was not sent to procurement to create a contract.
    These resulted in technically improper payments.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to invoice pricing that
    was required to validate whether a payment was proper or not. The agency was missing
    documentation which contained key information that would have enabled the agency's
    ability to discern whether the payment was proper or improper. For example, despite
    having a contract price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the
    contract due to lack of detail in the price schedule. For this reason, we are
    unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper without that documentation.

  pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of reductions
    and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
    Act of 2019 for FY 2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Communications,
    Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased its improper and unknown error rate
    from 3.58% to 2.70% (0.88% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $63.92
    million to $49.10 million ($14.82 million reduction).
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all
    requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget
    guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is
    not aware of additional program needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
    a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Communications, Utilities,
    and Other Rent program indicated that of the four actions assessed, two were closed
    and determined to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was open and
    determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open
    and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root
    cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine
    the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s)
    of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment
    amount from $4.28 million in FY 2020 to $1.07 million in FY 2021, or a 75% reduction.
    For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met, associated
    corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in
    the improper payment amount from $209.44 million in FY 2020 to $27.87 million
    in FY 2021, or an 87% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether
    proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did
    not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2020 to FY 2021.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally, VA will ensure
      ordering processes are compliant with statute and regulation, thus reducing
      technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments. These actions
      are designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure
      to access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation
      strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
      existing payment processes.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
    contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
    includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
    price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
    vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether or not the billed
    amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice of $1,000
    for lease of facility A; however, the contract price schedule is $3,000 for "rent"
    and does not specifically include a line item or rate for the billed lease of
    facility A.  For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether the payment is
    proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost details in the
    contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation related to invoice pricing that was required to validate whether
    a payment was proper or not. Specifically, the agency was unable to determine
    the appropriate pricing due to the lack information in the contract price schedule.
    Without documentation supporting the appropriate contract rate information, the
    program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

  pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent program continues to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions
    and is expected to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
    Act of 2019 for FY 2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Communications,
    Utilities, and Other Rent program decreased its improper and unknown error rate
    from 2.70% to 2.49% (0.21% reduction). Due to needs and increased costs, the program
    did see an increase in outlays of 16.93%; therefore, although the program did
    successfully reduce its rate of improper and unknown payments, its overall reported
    improper and unknown payments increased. Given the time it takes to implement
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued
    positive impact of these actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
    and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause
    of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of
    the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable
    to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments
    occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract terms. The majority
    of underpayments occurred because the claim was paid less than the lease agreement
    rate. The majority of technically improper payments occurred due to lack of requests
    for procurement action. The majority of unknown payments occurred because VA lacked
    information in the contract price schedule. Change process was the best mitigation
    strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
    existing payment processes.
  act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 2.49% in FY 2023 to 0.57%
    in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $39.82 million by implementing effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
    is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
    FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
    The overpayments and underpayments were attributed to VA's failure to access data/information,
    technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of the
    program not met, and unknown payments were attributed to being unable to determine
    whether proper or improper. Actions taken regarding change process included restructuring
    existing local and national contracts and rejecting invoices that do not comply
    with contract requirements. Additionally, VA ensured ordering processes were compliant
    with statute and regulation, thus reducing technically improper payments caused
    by unauthorized commitments.
  act17_3: VA updated corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and
    no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned were
    appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown
    payments. VA monitored progress and results of implementation on a quarterly basis.
    Additionally, an effectiveness review was performed annually to measure if an
    action planned had reduced or was properly designed to reduce improper and unknown
    payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. The annual effectiveness
    review process allowed VA to create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued
    progress in the remediation of improper and unknown payments. If areas for improvement
    were identified, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. The decrease
    in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from 2.49% in FY 2023 to 0.57%
    in FY 2024 supports the effective implementation and prioritization of action
    within the agency.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: VA did not set a reduction target for FY 2025 as the Communications, Utilities,
    and Other Rents program is reporting under the statutory threshold for significant
    improper payments in FY 2024. The program will revert to fulfilling legislative
    requirements for risk assessments no less than every three years. Management will
    continue its responsibilities for internal control outlined in the Government
    Accountability Office's Green Book.

  cyp6_1: 'While VA confirmed the payment was made to the right person in the right
    amount, all laws and regulations were not followed. Specifically, the purchase
    was made using a non-compliant procurement method. This resulted in technically
    improper payments for failing to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation sections:
    Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General (Part
    1.601) and Contract Modifications/General (Part 43.102).'

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
    contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
    includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
    price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
    vendor's invoice. The missing documentation was related to whether or not the
    billed amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice
    of $1,000 for lease of facility A; however, the contract price schedule is $3,000
    for "rent" and does not specifically include a line item or rate for the billed
    lease of facility A. For this reason, VA was unable to conclude whether the payment
    was proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost details
    in the contract price schedule.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA was missing or had insufficient
    documentation related to invoice pricing that was required to validate whether
    a payment was proper or not. Specifically, the agency was unable to determine
    the appropriate pricing due to the lack of information in the contract price schedule.
    Without documentation supporting the appropriate contract rate information, the
    program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occurred when the
      program failed to access the data/information needed to validate invoice amounts
      were in accordance with the contract rate. The agency had the direct ability
      to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment
      processes and simplifying contract pricing. These improvements allowed for more
      accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program continued to prioritize
    and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduced
    improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of rate
    reductions and projections under the statutory threshold for significant improper
    payments of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from FY 2023
    to FY 2024, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased its
    improper and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57%, a reduction of 1.92% and
    improper and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82 million
    reduction). At this time, VA is reporting under the statutory thresholds established
    for payment integrity and the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program
    will revert to fulfilling legislative requirements for risk assessments no less
    than every three years. Management will also continue its responsibilities for
    internal control outlined in the Government Accountability Office's Green Book.
  rap5: VA did not determine a tolerable rate as it was confident that planned and
    taken corrective actions and mitigation strategies did not impede the mission
    and could be implemented cost-effectively within existing budget authority. In
    FY 2024, this program is reporting under the statutory threshold for significant
    improper payments and will revert to fulfilling legislative requirements for risk
    no less than every three years. Management will continue its responsibilities
    for internal control outlined in the Government Accountability Office's Green
    Book.
  rap6: At this time, VA is reporting under the statutory thresholds established for

    Book.
  rnp3: 'The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program prioritized and implemented
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and
    unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of rate reductions
    and projections under the statutory threshold for significant improper payments
    of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024,
    the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased its improper
    and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57% (a reduction of 1.92%) and improper
    and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82 million reduction).
    In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and
    implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness
    of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
    implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Communications,
    Utilities, and Other Rents program indicated that of the five actions assessed,
    two were effective, two were designed effectively, and one was designed ineffectively.
    If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the
    program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s)
    of error.


    For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective
    actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
    payment amount from $23.30 million in FY 2023 to $8.57 million in FY 2024, or
    a 63% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
    reduction in the unknown payment amount from $27.74 million in FY 2023 to $0.73
    million in FY 2024, or a 97% reduction. For errors tied to failure to access data/information,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper
    payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024.


    Due to the program successfully reporting an error rate under 1.5% and improper
    payments under $100 million in FY 2024, an effectiveness review will not be performed
    in FY 2025. Management will continue its responsibilities for internal control
    outlined in the Government Accountability Office’s Green Book.'
  rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the OIG and reported improper
    and unknown payments below required thresholds for a compliance determination
    in FY 2025. Given the FY 2024 reported improper and unknown payment rate is below
    statutory thresholds, the program will not be required to set or meet applicable
    reduction targets. However, in FY 2025, VA executive managers and program personnel
    will continue responsibilities for internal control outlined in the Government
    Accountability Office’s Green Book. VA’s executive managers to include the Executive
    Director of Acquisition and program personnel will be held accountable through
    annual performance criteria contained within their performance plans. Performance
    criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties. Depending on each
    employees’ responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper and unknown
    payments through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments if appropriate,
    and implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper and unknown
    payments. State and local governments are not involved in the execution of this
    program.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA did not determine a tolerable rate as it was confident that planned and
    taken corrective actions and mitigation strategies did not impede the mission
    and could be implemented cost-effectively within existing budget authority. In
    FY 2024, this program is reporting under the statutory threshold for significant
    improper payments and will revert to fulfilling legislative requirements for risk
