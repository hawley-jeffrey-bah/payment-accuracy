    plan contains strategic goals that are related to strengthening program integrity,
    protecting taxpayer resources, and reducing improper payments. The agency’s IP
    and UP reduction targets and progress towards meeting those goals are reported
    annually in the AFR. In addition, the agency sets annual GPRA goals related to

    cyp4_1: The primary causes of Medicare Advantage (Part C) improper payments are

      determinations, and attest to this upon submission.  The MAO is also responsible
      for collecting and maintaining the source documentation (medical records) necessary
      to validate the data used in payment determinations. Medical records, the source
      document, are not submitted to the agency at the time of making payment determinations.

Description: Under the Medicare Advantage Program, also known as Medicare Part C,
  beneficiaries can opt to receive their Medicare benefits through a private health
  plan. Approximately half of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare
  Advantage plans. The primary causes of overpayments are medical record discrepancies
  and insufficient documentation. Medicare Advantage Organizations are responsible
  for collecting and maintaining the documentation necessary to validate the data
  used in payment determinations. Medical records are not submitted to the agency
  at the time of making payment determinations.
