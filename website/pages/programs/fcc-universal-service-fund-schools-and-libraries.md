  act17_1: USAC, in conjunction with the FCC, has implemented an Improper Payment
    Analysis process. Through this process, USAC management performs an analysis of
    its improper payments to understand the root cause and to identify corrective
    actions to mitigate the issues. In collaboration with USAC management, USAC’s
    Fraud Risk Group has developed a process to evaluate common root causes of improper
    payments in an effort to identify the true root cause to determine if additional
    corrective action is needed.
  act17_2: The most impactful corrective actions are focused on comparing the invoiced
    amount against the payment amount prior to disbursement. The “Pre-Payment Review”
    is considered adequate, as it properly addresses invoicing compliance-related
    issues. The review process is set up as a proactive approach to mitigate future
    potential improper payments related to invoicing errors.
  act17_3: During the Risk Management Council Meeting, management will continue to
    review the improper payments and prioritize the largest monetary impact findings
    accordingly. During the meetings, management has an opportunity to discuss effective
    improper payment mitigation strategies. USAC’s Fraud Risk Group has developed
    a process to evaluate common root causes of improper payments in an effort to
    identify the true root cause to determine if additional corrective action is needed.
    This process has enabled USAC management to institutionalize corrective actions
    as part of its program integrity efforts, which will prevent future instances
    of improper payments. USAC leadership is implementing a quarterly review process
    to discuss progress towards executing these corrective actions.   The results
    of the strategy are clear with the reduction of the improper payment rate to 1.27%,
    which is under the threshold of 1.50%.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The reduction target is, 1.20%, which is less than the current improper
    payment rate of 1.27%.  USAC considered the average of the improper payment rates
    for the last three years to determine the improper payment rate reduction target.

    cyp2_1: Invoicing Error and Internal Connections/Not Installed is the major cause
      of overpayments within agency control.  USAC’s Schools and Libraries Invoicing
      team is leveraging open data sets and coding capabilities to improve the efficiency
      of invoicing-related validations. In addition, the Schools and Libraries program
      team transitioned the invoicing process from the SL Legacy Systems to the E-Rate
      Productivity Center (EPC), which is expected to help identify invoicing errors
      before disbursements are issued.

    cyp4_1: Competitive bidding is a formal process to identify and request the eligible
      equipment and/or services the applicants need, so that potential service providers
      can review those requests and submit responsive bids.  Schools and Libraries
      program applicants must conduct fair and open competitive bidding processes
      and select the most cost-effective equipment and services using the price of
      the eligible equipment and services as the primary factor. The applicant is
      responsible for ensuring that its competitive bidding process is compliant with
      FCC rules and free from any potential conflicts of interest.
  rap5: The Schools and Libraries program has the internal controls, human capital,
    information systems, and other infrastructure it requires to reduce improper payments
    to the target levels.  USAC continues to evaluate to ensure the proper infrastructure
    is in place.
  rap6: The Schools and Libraries program team did not identify additional resources
    needed to improve the overall structure of the program in its most current budget
    submission. USAC continues to work with the FCC to determine any gaps in its overall
    requirements.
  rnp3: "The Schools and Libraries team is using data analytics to identify potential\
    \ competitive bidding issues.  Data analytics will be used to identify potential\
    \ conflicts of interest, prior to issuing funding commitments. The team is also\
    \ leveraging data analytics to improve competitive bidding training and enhance\
    \ compliance by adding content regarding the minimum 28 day waiting period to\
    \ select service providers, the factors for assessing responsive bids, and document\
    \ retention.  In addition, preventative controls have been added to proactively\
    \ identify and prevent the types of invoicing errors identified in the PQA assessments\
    \ from re-occurring in the future, and providing enhanced training regarding the\
    \ invoicing process. \n\nSchools and Libraries mitigation strategy to reduce the\
    \ improper payments have proven to be successful.  The results of the strategy\
    \ are clear with the reduction of the improper payment rate to 1.27%, which is\
    \ under the threshold of 1.50%."
  rnp4: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are known as Beneficiary and Contributor
    Audit Program (BCAP) audits. BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments
    that must be recovered, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste, fraud,
    and abuse. USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as the Payment

    Quality Assurance (PQA) program. Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling
    methodology to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC,
    USF-LL, USF-RHC, and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is
    to estimate an improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules.
    To recover improper payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery policy
    to standardize the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC improper
    payments are deemed collectible and USAC has either recovered or is in the process
    of recovering the improper payments.'
