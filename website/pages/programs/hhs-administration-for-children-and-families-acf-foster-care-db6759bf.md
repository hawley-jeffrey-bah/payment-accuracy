  pro1: "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) did not report the IV-E\
    \ Foster Care national improper payment rate for FYs 2021 and 2022 due to a lack\
    \ of new data, stemming from the postponement of reviews during the COVID-19 public\
    \ health emergency.  Nevertheless, HHS continues to focus targeted corrective\
    \ action efforts on continuous quality improvement and heightened communication\
    \ and outreach to states regarding best practices to address and prevent payment\
    \ errors in preparation for when the IV-E Reviews resume.  HHS relied on previous\
    \ data and experiences to develop and update its corrective action plans.  Traditionally,\
    \ all improper payments (100 percent) in the Title IV-E Foster Care Program are\
    \ administrative or process errors due to incorrect case classification and payment\
    \ processing by state agencies (e.g., Failure to Access Data/Information).  The\
    \ Title IV-E Foster Care Program designs corrective action plans to help states\
    \ address the improper payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper payments.\
    \  Targeted corrective actions to reduce and prevent the types of payment errors\
    \ driving previous performance include: \n\n     - HHS works with states to emphasize\
    \ and develop strategies for continuous program improvement.  HHS emphasizes viewing\
    \ the quality assurance process as ongoing and developing sound program improvements\
    \ that support systemic change and sustain improvement efforts. A continuous quality\
    \ improvement effort helps maintain an awareness of the ongoing needs rather than\
    \ only in a review year, which reduces incidences of improper payments overall.\n\
    \n     - In response to the Family First Act, enacted as Title VII of the Bipartisan\
    \ Budget Act of 2018, HHS issued written guidance and conducted a series of webinars\
    \ in FY 2018 and has continued to provide guidance through written responses to\
    \ many questions in FYs 2019 – 2022. These exchanges with states helped to resolve\
    \ challenging eligibility questions. They also provided opportunities to explain\
    \ various aspects of the Title IV-E requirements, clarify documentation requirements,\
    \ and assist states’ understanding of complex policy concepts and their determination\
    \ on whether a child meets Title IV-E eligibility requirements for foster care\
    \ maintenance payments. HHS will continue using lessons learned from this process\
    \ to inform future guidance and education.  In FY 2023, HHS expects to issue an\
    \ updated title IV-E review guide, instrument and instructions and will conduct\
    \ webinars and outreach to deepen federal and state staff knowledge of the federal\
    \ requirements. \n\n     - HHS, through its interactions with states,  encouraged\
    \ effective communication between state child welfare agencies and licensing agencies\
    \ to further promote adequate documentation of licensing and safety check compliance.\
    \  Assisting states with developing and applying techniques to effectively engage\
    \ foster care providers in a partnership to reduce or eliminate improper payments\
    \ is integral to success.  HHS will also continue to encourage states to regularly\
    \ and systematically monitor foster care providers to document and promote compliance\
    \ with the Title IV-E requirements and require non-compliant providers to undergo\
    \ corrective action.\n\n     - Through its review of claims and audit resolution,\
    \ HHS continued its efforts to have states address financial reporting and claiming\
    \ errors. \n\nHHS continues to provide training and technical assistance to states\
    \ in developing and implementing program improvements, even when states are not\
    \ required to develop a Program Improvement Plan.  This assistance helps states\
    \ expand organizational capacity and promote more effective program operations.\
    \  Corrective actions have decreased the overall number of payment errors and\
    \ altered the composition of identified payment errors.  For example, following\
    \ years of work with State Court Improvement Programs and outreach to heighten\
    \ judicial awareness, judiciary-related errors, once the most prevalent error\
    \ type, are now among the least common. HHS will continue to work closely with\
    \ states and Tribes to ensure they have a clear understanding of the federal requirements\
    \ and are prepared to effectively manage their foster care programs. \nHHS staff\
    \ and technical assistance providers also have offered technical assistance on\
    \ Title IV-E eligibility issues to Tribes operating or planning to operate the\
    \ Title IV-E Foster Care Program, many of whom have limited previous experience\
    \ in matters relating to Title IV-E eligibility determinations."

  act17_1: The actions taken by HHS were focused on the cause of the Improper Payments
    and Unknown Payments in the Title IV-E Foster Care Program because the assistance
    was targeted to address the root causes of errors because HHS identified specific
    root causes of errors and associated corrective actions for each reviewed state.
    In FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews,
    following a nearly four-year suspension due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although
    HHS did not conduct any new reviews during the period of suspension, HHS relied
    on previous data and experiences to develop and update its corrective action plans,
    which are designed to help states address the improper payments that contribute
    most to Title IV-E improper payments.  The adequacy of these actions is reflected
    in the low FY 2024 reported error rate of 4.82%.
  act17_2: The corrective actions taken by HHS are adequate for the Title IV-E Foster
    Care Program because the assistance is targeted to address the specific root causes
    of errors for each reviewed state. In FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title
    IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, following a nearly four-year suspension
    due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adequacy of these corrective
    actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate of 4.82%.
  act17_3: The effective implementation and prioritization of the corrective actions
    taken for the Title IV-E Foster Care Program are evidenced in HHS's continued
    development and delivery of corrective actions to reduce the occurrence of Improper
    and Unknown Payments despite the nearly four-year suspension of calculating and
    reporting an error rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although HHS did not conduct
    any new reviews during the period of suspension, HHS relied on previous data and
    experiences to develop and update its corrective action plans to help states address
    the root causes that contributed most to Title IV-E improper payments.  Since
    HHS did not calculate and report an Improper Payment and Unknown Payment rate
    from FY 2020 through FY 2023, we cannot determine if the actions are effective
    in reducing the rate, however, the FY 2024 reported error rate of 4.82% is significantly
    less than the statutory threshold of 10%.

    cyp4_1: Overpayments are outside of HHS's control because Title IV-E Foster Care
      Program is a federally funded, state-administered grant program, with funds
      awarded to states/recipients.  HHS administers formula and entitlement grants
      to support states and tribes in operating their child welfare systems, including
      foster care, and the information systems necessary to support these programs.
      States and tribes do not compete for these funds. Rather, they are distributed
      based on predetermined reimbursement rates and eligibility requirements, based
      on claims submitted by each jurisdiction to reimburse allowable costs the jurisdictions
      have certified as accurate.

  rap5: HHS has not determined if it has what is needed with respect to internal controls,
    human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper
    payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate because HHS has not determined
    a tolerable rate for the Foster Care program.   In FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting
    onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, following a nearly four-year
    suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The IV-E Review protocol is not conducted
    specifically for improper payment estimation but is instead governed by regulations
    authorizing federal monitoring of child welfare programs.  Data from the Title
    IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews are used to calculate the Foster Care Error
    Rate.
  rap6: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees includes
    a request for $10.68 billion for the Payments for Foster Care, Prevention, and
    Permanency appropriation, which provides funding for the Title IV-E Foster Care  and
    other related programs.  This appropriation also supports administrative and training
    costs. This account is subject to sequestration of administrative costs in an
    otherwise exempt account in accordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency
    Deficit Control Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-177), as amended by the Budget Control Act
    of 2011 (P.L. 112-25), which affects funding for certain activities under Foster
    Care, and other related programs.  Other than administrative and training costs,
    no request were made for resources specifically for establishing and maintaining
    payment integrity.
  rnp3: HHS anticipates that the level of planned or completed corrective actions
    will address the cause of the Improper Payments and potential Unknown Payments
    proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.  During
    the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, HHS identified specific root causes
    of errors and associated corrective actions for each reviewed state.  In FY 2024,
    HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E reviews, following a nearly four-year
    suspension due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the period of
    the suspension, HHS relied on previous data and experiences to develop and update
    its corrective action plans, which are designed to help states address the improper
    payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper payments.  The adequacy of
    these actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate of 4.82%.
  rnp4: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with the
    requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
    Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
    Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this annual
    assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control and Risk
    Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable office.
    Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement which represents
    the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to the overall adequacy
    and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating Division related
    to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal entities that
    receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes, and non-profit
    organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single Audit Act of
    1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative Requirements,
    Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that was in effect
    during FY 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities that expend $750,000
    or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal year. With the
    Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released revisions to the Uniform
    Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective October 01, 2024.  In
    addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities, overpayments
    are identified and recovered through Single Audits and HHS Office of Inspector
    General audits.  For each of the aforementioned activities, recipients are subject
    to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with program regulations.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: HHS has not determined the tolerable rate for this program because in FY
    2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews,
    following a nearly four-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The IV-E
    Review protocol is not conducted specifically for improper payment estimation
    but is instead governed by regulations authorizing federal monitoring of child
    welfare programs.  Data from the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews are
    used to calculate the Foster Care Error Rate.
