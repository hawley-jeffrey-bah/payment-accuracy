  cyp20_2: Because COVID-EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021, the improper
    payment estimates for FY 2023 will only consist of any loan increases and reconsiderations
    that were disbursed after March 31, 2022.  For FY 2023, the SBA established a
    reduction target of 4.40 percent for the COVID-EIDL program.

  pro1: The Small Business Act authorizes the SBA to make EIDL loans to eligible small
    businesses and nonprofit organizations located in a disaster area.  On March 6,
    2020, Congress deemed COVID-19 to be a disaster, thus allowing the SBA to declare
    disasters and make EIDL loans available to small businesses and nonprofit organizations
    suffering substantial economic injury as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  rap5: The SBA has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and
    unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
  rap6: No resources have been requested in the most recent budget submission of the
    agency to establish and maintain the internal controls.
  rnp3: SBA's COVID-EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021.  No further corrective
    actions, training or audit, are planned.
  rtp1: Unknown

    Description_Action_Taken: As of January 1, 2022, the SBA stopped accepting applications
      for new COVID EIDL loans. As of May 6, 2022, the SBA was no longer processing
      COVID EIDL increase requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined
      loan applications. As of May 16, 2022, the COVID EIDL portal was closed.  SBA
      is no longer originating loans or disbursing newly approved funds under this
      program. Therefore,   no Training corrective action(s) are planned for the COVID
      EIDL program.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: The Audit corrective action(s) taken include the performance
      of ongoing quality assurance reviews of PDC Departments' loan origination and
      disbursement activities to identify improper and potentially improper payments,
      and to identify areas  in which the PDC Departments may require additional training
      to reduce the possibility of future improper payments, The Disaster Internal
      Control Division (DICD) are not conducting quality assurance reviews for COVID
      EIDL program going forward, as the program has ended and is no longer originating
      loans or disbursing newly approved funds.

      EIDL program.
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: The Training corrective action(s) taken include quarterly
      training to Processing and Disbursement Center (PDC) staff on the causes and
      prevention of, improper payments. In accordance with Numbered Memo (NM) 22-04,
      the PDC Departments are required to develop and conduct improper payment training
      to address the Improper Payment Audit deficiencies identified.  Further, the
      PDC Director or designee must certify to the Director of Internal Controls or
      designee, that the training has been completed.  Training corrective actions
      are not being taken going forward as the COVID EIDL program stopped accepting
      new applications on January 1, 2022, and as of May 6, 2022, ceased acceptance
      of loan increase requests or requests for reconsideration of previously declined
      applications and therefore are no longer originating loans or disbursing newly
      approved funds.

  cyp20_2: Because the COVID EIDL program ended as of December 31, 2021, the FY 2023
    improper payment estimates only consisted of re-disbursements of previously rejected
    disbursements or loan increases and reconsiderations disbursed after March 31,
    2022; there is no new funding for this program. Therefore, there is no reduction
    target rate established for FY 2024.

    cyp2: '2537.39'
    cyp2_1: The root cause of overpayments on the COVID EIDL program was failure to
      access data/information. The most prevalent causes of improper payments stemmed
      from missing verification of business ownership, incorrect accounting of duplication
      of benefits, missing franchise documentation, and incorrect calculation of economic
      injury.  The loan originations and subsequent disbursement of loan funds to
      eligible borrowers for a correct amount in material compliance with the Loan
      Authorization and Agreement, SBA regulations, state and federal laws, Standard
      Operating Procedures (SOPs), COVID EIDL program guidelines, and other applicable
      SBA guidance, is within the agency's control.

    the causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments, that are proportional
    to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.
