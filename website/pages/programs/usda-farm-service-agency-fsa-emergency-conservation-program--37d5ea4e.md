  rap5: "Steps Planned\n1.\tNew software to process ECP cost share applications and\
    \ payments more efficiently and to reduce errors is essential to improve program\
    \ delivery.  A project development schedule has been designed; however, implementation\
    \ will be based on the Agency IT budget availability and the completion of its\
    \ current IT priority list.  \n\n2.  FSA has planned to implement the ECP district\
    \ director review process to the new FSA Internal Review Document and Tracking\
    \ System (IRDTS) to ensure reviews are being completed timely and results are\
    \ monitored and evaluated to ensure ECP policies are being followed. FSA’s IRDTS\
    \ is a new centralized, automated internal control tracking system that allows\
    \ management at all levels to complete and track program audits and reviews.\n\
    \ \n•\tIn May 2019, FSA leadership approved the funding and selected the platform\
    \ for the development of the IRDTS software.  \n•\tBy September 30, 2021, FSA\
    \ will have incorporated its first phase (Phase 1) of programs that have review\
    \ processes being completed manually. \n•\tBy December 1, 2021, FSA will begin\
    \ the second phase (Phase 2) of incorporating FSA program reviews into IRDTS,\
    \ which will include ECP. By using the IRDTS solution for applicable FSA Oversight\
    \ Assessments, FSA will be able to plan, sample records, conduct assessment reviews,\
    \ and document the results over time to score and track errors found during the\
    \ reviews.  FSA will use this data to improve processes and policies, identify\
    \ areas where additional employee training is needed and understand trends and\
    \ systemic issues occurring at the state and county levels.\n\nNOTE: Implementation\
    \ of ECP into IRDTS is subjected to Agency budget availability and the priority\
    \ of other program review candidates that are scheduled to be implemented. All\
    \ phases of the integration of ECP district director reviews into IRDTS are estimated\
    \ to be completed by September 30, 2022. \n"
  rnp3: "The following actions were put into place fall of this year and should show\
    \ profound reductions in IP during the 2022 review:\n\n1.\tFSA updated and revised\
    \ Handbook 1-ECP, May 4, 2021 (rev 6) and Rev 7 on September 16, 2021. This handbook\
    \ provides guidance to Field offices and sets forth policy regarding ECP program\
    \ management, provides updates of new requirements and provides clarification\
    \ to previous existing requirements. \n\n2.\tFSA recognizes the need for improvements\
    \ regarding documenting installation costs to ensure producer documentation is\
    \ sufficient, prevent ineligible costs, and ensure the correct reimbursement rates\
    \ are used.  \nAs a result, in FY 2020, FSA established a Payment Scenario Development\
    \ Team, whose role is to assist in the development and training of payment scenarios\
    \ to ensure ECP payments are being applied correctly and documented properly.\
    \ The rollout of the payment scenarios software occurred September 16, 2021 and\
    \ will included an updated handbook and joint training with FSA and Natural Resources\
    \ Conservation Service (NRCS) field offices to discuss the new policy.  Training\
    \ occurred as follow:\n•\tJuly 27, 2021 – training to review the policy change\
    \ as well as how the software will compliment this new change\n•\tJuly 28, 2021\
    \ – training to review the handbook revision that includes the new policy\n3.\t\
    Notice CP-74 was issued on July 7, 2021 providing procedure for completing compliance\
    \ reviews and performing spot checks.  The Notice can be found at (https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_Notice/cp_764.pdf).\n\
    4.\tCCC-770 ECP-1 checklist was revised to require DD signature during the ECP\

    \ more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   \n\
    \nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve\
    \ the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity\
    \ and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional\
    \ compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive\
    \ and robust compliance program.  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions\
    \ whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related\
    \ issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer,\
    \ but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency\
    \ to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability\
    \ and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
    \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal\
    \ controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are\
    \ still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity\
    \ to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
    \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating\
    \ the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency\
    \ program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues\
    \ to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering\
    \ Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers\
    \ duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties.\
    \ Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing\
    \ a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal\
    \ year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.\n\nInformation\
    \ Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive\
    \ measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to\
    \ reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance;\
    \ therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal\
    \ controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance\
    \ of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning\
    \ to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software\
    \ to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster\
    \ programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative\
    \ entries and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software\
    \ “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the\
    \ increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current\
    \ deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems.\
    \ \n\nFrom an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has\
    \ invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues\
    \ to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
    \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
    \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
    \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
    \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned\
    \ through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s\
    \ new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions\
    \ to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to:\
    \ 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical,\
    \ survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling”\
    \ and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are\
    \ delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a\
    \ risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified\
    \ to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics\
    \ that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating\
    \ a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators,\
    \ anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment\
    \ of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation\
    \ of authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
    \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and\
    \ determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm\
    \ Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling\
    \ of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval\
    \ and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and\
    \ the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency,\
    \ data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant\
    \ investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations\
    \ have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase\
    \ transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to\
    \ support important mission-focused decision-making.  \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm\
    \ Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program\
    \ 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity\
    \ Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss\
    \ Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio,\

  rap5: Emergency Conservation Program does not have sufficient resources to add needed
    internal controls, human resources, and information systems to reduce the improper
    payment and unknown payments.  Emergency Conservation Program leverages the existing
    internal controls environment and accountability processes to provide reasonable
    assurances that internal controls are in place and operating effectively.  A continuous
    evaluation system which monitors the effectiveness of internal controls is in
    place but is not sufficient to reduce improper payments rates.
  rap6: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget and the fiscal year 2025 Department
    Estimates submitted to Office of Management and Budget does not include funding
    levels to support the required software enhancements to increase application controls.  Due
    to budget constraints for the agency approved funding levels, the funding required
    to build automated internal controls within the existing systems is not included.
  rnp3: The requirement to have an FSA-23 on file before the cost share agreement
    is approved and included on the CCC-770 Checklist as well as an update to the
    checklist to address the revised FSA-848-A without signatures by the participant
    before the payment was issued.  The agency has revised the CCC-770 checklist to
    capture the District Director reviews during approval, payment, and lifespan of
    the practice.  This will allow the District Directors to ensure and verify that
    the FSA-23 approval is completed before the cost share agreement is approved and
    the FSA-848-A is signed by agency and the participant before the payment is issued.  The
    checklist covers each step of the program process, including requesting cost share,
    approval, and payment.  The District Director is required to review and sign at
    each item on the checklist to ensure accuracy.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: The agency does not have sufficient resources to add needed internal controls,
    human resources, and information systems to reduce the improper payment and unknown
    payments.  The agency will continue to strategically take the necessary steps
    to strengthen internal control measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance
    processes, and improve accountability. A continuous evaluation system which monitors
    the effectiveness of internal controls is in place but is not sufficient to reduce
    improper payments rates.  Lastly, agency will require key resources to continue
    its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies
    with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold.

  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters is
    to have an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this may not
    represent the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions taken
    by the agency have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent
    threshold.
