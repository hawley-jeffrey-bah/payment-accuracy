    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department’s unknown payments within the Civilian
      Pay Other Defense Organization were primarily a result of the lack of sufficient
      key supporting documentation (KSD) to substantiate whether payments were proper
      or improper at the time of post-payment reviews. Specifically, with payments
      related to the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense Health
      Agency (DHA), the Department was undergoing a consolidation of components at
      the DHA and the Civilian Humans Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the transition,
      certain individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed. This
      meant that the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting
      documentation, such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper
      and unknown payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024 who were unfamiliar
      with the procedure and process of procuring and providing supporting documentation.
      As a result, the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became
      arduous and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain,
      review, and ultimately provide KSD to substantiate payments. Examples of the
      missing KSDs are travel orders, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report
      (SF-1190), and Standard Form 50 (SF-50) Notification of Personnel Action to
      validate alimony garnishments, child support garnishments, market pay validation,
      location information, living quarters allowance (LQA).


      In FY 2025 DHA-MTF will evaluate and develop new processes to ensure the auditors
      and/or DFAS reviewers receive the correct key supporting documentation for the
      samples in a timely manner based off of the deliverable schedule.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Due to the delays with the system upgrades the DoD
      Education Activity (DoDEA) has implemented a manual compensating control since
      March 2024. Management has identified the following concerns with this compensating
      control:

      1) It has become a burden on the DoDEA staff. Specifically, continuing this
      process would require digitally signing the CAC for over 12,000 documents a
      year.


      2) This manual process carries a large risk of PII data spillage as the information
      included on the SF1190 and the DD1614, contains PII.


      3) It is not cost beneficial nor an acceptable risk for DoDEA to continue with
      this compensating control.

    Description_Action_Taken: A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard Form(SF)-1190
      in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances. A DoDEA
      employee  must also complete a DD-1614 in order to apply for Non-TDY Travel.   Completion
      of the SF-1190 and the DD-1614 provides the necessary information to determine
      the correct amount for all overseas and travel allowances.  During the FY23
      and FY24 audit, the SF-1190 and DD-1614 were provided and reviewed by DFAS.
      It was found that the SF-1190 did not have consistent signatures and dates due
      to system issues. DoDEA is in the process of completing a system modernization
      of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be housed on our
      internal ServiceNow network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability
      for CAC enabled signatures and dates. Unfortunately, the system upgrades were
      stalled and compensating controls were put in place.

  act17_1: 'The Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is a combination of both mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions aimed at reducing the likelihood of Technically Improper
    or Unknown Payment errors occurring during the payment process. A CAP was developed
    to address the root cause of the Department’s unknown payments under the Civilian
    Pay – Other Defense Organizations program. The CAP will address unknown payments
    by developing training materials outlining the steps to be taken related to pulling
    key documents. The goal is to disseminate a standard and repeatable process and
    to establish a set of guidelines that will ensure that supporting material is
    readily available to substantiate payments during post-payment reviews.


    In the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) (SF1190) and the Travel Order
    Processing System (TOPS)(DD1614), a DoDEA employee must complete an SF1190 to
    apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  The DoDEA employee
    must also complete an DD-1614 to apply for Non-TDY Travel. DAPS and TOPS are to
    be modernized in the coming years and will provide the capability to have CAC
    signatures on the SF1190 and DD1614.'
  act17_2: 'The Department fully expects the DoDEA system modernization will solve

    their main cause for technically improper payments due to lack of the proper signature.
    With the system upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC enabled signatures
    and dates. Furthermore, the Department is confident that the Defense Health Agency
    Military Treatment Facilities will continue to reduce improper payments by fully
    implementing their new processes to ensure the auditors and/or DFAS reviewers
    receive the correct key supporting documentation for the samples in a timely manner
    based off of the deliverable schedule.'
  act17_3: Each Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is dual signed by the Department Component
    responsible for the corrective actions and consolidated at the Department-level
    by both the Senior Executive responsible for the Component and the Department
    Payment Integrity Program Manager for accountability. Each milestone within the
    CAP are monitored and issued out from the Department to the DoD Components as
    deliverable requirements based off of the timelines established on the CAP. Furthermore,
    the Department Payment Integrity Portfolio Manager reviews the submission to ensure
    the documented progress will reduce Department improper payments effectively.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Department’s Payment Integrity program - Other Defense Organization
    Civilian Pay’s reduction target is less than the estimated future Improper Payment
    and Unknown Payment rate. The Department is fully confident in the two ODO Civilian
    Pay corrective action plans. These CAPs will be effectively implemented by DoDEA
    and DHA-MTF and will be fully effective at considerably reducing the improper
    and unknown payment rates below the OMB statutory threshold in FY 2024.

    policies and procedures related to the review and approval of SF1190s.

    DoDEA has multiple audits each year and a Resource Management (RM) Financial Analysis

    are held accountable through appraisal standards which limit them to no more than
    5 errors per quarter, certifying official appraisal standards hold them to no
    more than 1% of payments certified during the rating period identified as improper.
    In addition, certifying officials have pecuniary liability for loss of funds unless
    relieved. Managers have overall responsibility to ensure metric targets are met
    and maintained.


    The Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials Steering Committee
    (the Committee) was created in FY 2018 and it institutionalized a forum of accountability
    to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required by Appendix C of the OMB
    Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with the Payment Integrity Information
    Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired by the Office of the Under Secretary
    of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial Officer and co-chaired by the
    Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy Director of Operations. It also
    includes Senior Executive Service representatives from the Military Services and
    defense agencies. The Committee provides oversight to the DoD Payment Integrity
    program and drives action for compliance with the PIIA. More specifically, the
    Committee evaluates the status of improper payments testing, the root causes of
    improper payments and appropriate actions to reduce them, payment recovery activities,
    and solutions to resolve DoD-wide audit findings and recommendations related to
    improper payments. Additionally, it supports Payment Integrity risk assessments,
    audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations, and oversees
    the identification of root cause(s) and the development and implementation of
    corrective actions to address areas of noncompliance.
