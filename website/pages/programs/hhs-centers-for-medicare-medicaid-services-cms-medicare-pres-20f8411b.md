    cyp4_1: The primary causes of Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) improper

      the source document, are not submitted to the agency at the time of making payment
      determinations.
  pro1: 'In Reporting Year (RY) 2023, CMS implemented methodology refinements and

    rate estimation. Due to the methodology changes introduced in RY 2023, the rates
    for RY 2022 and RY 2023 are not comparable. A baseline for improper payments in
    Medicare Part D has not yet been established, as the RY 2023 estimate reflects
    numerous methodology changes.


    CMS is committed to strengthening and maintaining program integrity efforts to

    and address the root causes of the improper payments. For example, HHS audits
    Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs and educate sponsors on fraud,
    waste, and abuse. These audits have varying scopes but share the goal of reducing
    and recovering improper Part D payments. Future audits may account for areas in

  act17_1: Part D overpayments mainly consist of errors resulting from drug or drug
    coverage or insufficient documentation. As such, CMS focused on educating Part
    D plan sponsors on issues of fraud, waste, and abuse to cut down on confusion
    regarding documentation requirements and coverage requirements under Part D.
  act17_2: In FY 2025, HHS will continue Part D plan sponsor audits, outreach, and
    training to reduce overpayments. Audits and training will be focused on high-risk
    drugs (i.e., at high risk of overpayments and/or beneficiary harm) and other areas
    of risk to the program. HHS' activities will align with the drivers and root causes
    of the error rate.
  act17_3: In FY 2024, HHS audited Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs
    and educate sponsors on fraud, waste, and abuse. HHS also conducted trainings,
    such as Opioid Education Mission webinars. The improper payment rate for FY 2024
    is 3.70%, which supports the effective implementation and prioritization of action
    within the agency. Collectively, future improper payment rate results will inform
    whether the overall corrective action plan was effective and provide insight into
    which components of the plan may need to be modified or refined to improve effectiveness.

Description: Medicare Part D is a federal prescription drug benefit program for Medicare
  beneficiaries. The primary causes of overpayments are drug discrepancies (when the
  drug dispensed differs from the drug prescribed), drug pricing discrepancies (when
  the pricing on the drug prescribed differs from the pricing of the drug dispensed,
  commonly due to dosing issues), and insufficient documentation to determine whether
  payment was proper or improper. The agency contracts with Part D Sponsors who are
  responsible for administering the program, which includes the accuracy of data and
  support for payment purposes and validation. A known barrier to preventing improper
  payments is that sponsors' compliance with requirements is outside of the agency's
  control.
