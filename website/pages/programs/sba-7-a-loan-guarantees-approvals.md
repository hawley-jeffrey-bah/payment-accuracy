  cyp20_2: For FY 2023, the SBA established a reduction target of 1.00 percent for
    the 7(a) loan guaranty approvals program. This FY 2023 reduction target is the
    same as the FY 2022 improper payment rate estimate.  The root cause of improper
    payments in the 7(a) loan guaranty approvals program stems from shortfalls in
    the lenders’ loan authentication process, which are outside of the SBA control.  As
    such, keeping the reduction target rate in-line with the current improper payment
    rate estimate offers a conservative and realistic target for the SBA.
