  cyp20_2: The Beneficiary Travel reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper payment estimates.  Reduction
    targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has
    learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments
    legislation is that it can take three years from the point an error cause is isolated
    during testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then wait for
    payments to be made that can then be tested the following year since VA tests
    and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '16.56'

  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, VA lacked proper approval on medical qualification. Specifically, where
    clinical documentation for special mode travel was not properly approved by a
    VA clinician.  This resulted in a technically improper payment.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to authorization, receiving
    or payment documentation that was required to validate whether a payment was proper
    or not. The agency was missing documentation which contained key information that
    would have enabled the agency's ability to discern whether the payment was proper
    or improper. The missing documentation contained information such as the special
    mode transportation preauthorization, authorization for common carrier, consultation,
    proof of care, and claim form for reimbursement.

    cyp2_1: The agency has the direct ability to prevent Beneficiary Travel program
      overpayments from occurring. As VA modernizes agency-wide systems of record
      and decommissions outdated, legacy technology, VA will gain the capability to
      integrate transportation claimsâ€™ processing systems, improving, monitoring and
      internal controls. VA seeks to fully implement standardized payment processing
      tools to streamline claims, automate eligibility determinations, detect and
      prevent improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing capabilities.
      Further, as the agency moves toward a centralized operating environment, the
      Beneficiary Travel program will establish direct lines of authority and standard
      processes and procedures based on transportation regulatory requirements.

  pro1: The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY
    2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the Beneficiary Travel program decreased
    its improper and unknown error rate from 13.93% to 7.90% (6.03% reduction) and
    improper and unknown payments from $123.06 million to $99.08 million ($23.98 million
    reduction).
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all
    requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget
    guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is
    not aware of additional program needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per Office of Management and Budget guidance before attempting to establish
    a tolerable rate.  At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Beneficiary Travel program
    indicated that of the nine actions assessed, four were open and determined to
    be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and five were open and determined
    that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements
    could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
    strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2020
    to FY 2021. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
    reduction in the improper payment amount from $42.96 million in FY 2020 to $5.02
    million in FY 2021, or an 88% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine
    whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies
    contributed to a total reduction in the unknown payment amount from $54.84 million
    in FY 2020 to $36.73 million in FY 2021, or a 33% reduction.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      detection and prevention of improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing
      capabilities. Additionally, VA will continue with the post-implementation modernization
      of the beneficiary travel claims processing software and other systems. In addition,
      VA will continue planning for the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System for invoice payment processing nationwide, which is expected to improve
      the timeliness and accuracy of ambulance claims processing. These actions are
      designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes
      and human error.

    Specifically, where clinical documentation for special mode travel was not properly
    and timely approved by a VA clinician, or a request was not sent to procurement
    to create a contract modification. These resulted in technically improper payments
    for failing to comply with 38 Code of Federal Regulations - Applications (Part
    70.20), 38 Code of Federal Regulations - Criteria for approval (Part 70.4), and
    Federal Acquisition Regulation sections General (Part 1.601)  and Policy (Part

  cyp7_ucp2_1: VA is required to validate an applicant's eligibility documentation
    such as income or interfacility (transfer between VA facilities) verification.
    VA uses projected gross household income and deductible expenses to validate that
    the applicant is eligible based on income. VA uses the non-VA care authorizations
    and medical records to verify eligibility to transfer between VA facilities. When
    review of the payments reveals that the station failed to obtain the eligibility
    documentation, the payment is considered an unknown payment because the reviewer
    is unable to discern whether the payment was a proper payment or an improper payment.
  cyp7_ucp4: '9.58'
  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate authorization of transport and care. However,
    the agency currently does not have the documentation necessary to determine if
    the payment is proper or not. Local VA Medical Centers failed to provide authorization
    and receiving documentation. Specifically, authorization documentation such as
    the non-VA care authorization or special mode travel or emergent ambulance document
    was not obtained. The missing documentation needed will assist VA in determining
    the clinical need for transport. Centralized documentation retention for each
    claim is not currently possible within the agencyâ€™s current systems of record
    environment. Hard copy evidence can be maintained at local VA Medical Centers
    responsible for claims processing. For this reason, we are unable to conclude
    whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without that documentation.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation related to authorization, receiving, or eligibility documentation
    that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or improper. Specifically,
    these unknown payments occur when the agency was unable to determine the Veteran's
    eligibility due to missing annual income documentation, the special mode transportation
    was not medically necessary or approved by a VA clinician before transportation
    occurred, and the stations did not provide proof of receipt. Without annual income
    eligibility, receiving supporting documentation and special mode transportation
    or common carrier preauthorization and/or proof of care, if applicable, the program
    is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

    cyp2: '88.50'
    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program

      that could provide the Veteran's treatment was utilized, special mode transportation
      rates were correctly paid according to contract, if applicable, services were
      received, beneficiary met administrative and medical qualification, or claim
      payments were calculated according to mileage and deductibles, if applicable.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving processes and controls surrounding administrative and medical qualifications,
      and simplifying contract pricing, when applicable, to include valid claim mileage
      calculations. Additionally, system improvements will allow for automation of
      the authorizations and will ensure services are rendered, decreasing human error.
      These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY
    2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Beneficiary Travel program decreased
    its improper and unknown error rate from 7.90% to 6.83% (1.07% reduction). Due
    to beneficiary needs and increased costs, the program did see an increase in outlays
    of 40%; therefore, although the program did successfully reduce its rate of improper
    and unknown payments, its overall reported improper and unknown payments increased.
    Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies,
    the program expects the continued positive impact of these actions on its FY 2024
    improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VAâ€™s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VAâ€™s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
  rnp3: 'The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement effective

      solutions including reviewing the effectiveness of quality assurance and monitoring
      reporting processes and developing and implementing effective standardized processes.
      These actions were designed to reduce improper and unknown payment errors associated
      with statutory requirements of program were not met and unable to determine
      whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
      the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.

      action plans to expand use of transportation modalities that will streamline
      third-party preauthorized claims processing, integrate medical qualifications,
      and automate contract execution. These actions were designed to address overpayments
      and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, and technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program not met. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error.

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included continuing to implement new software
      that provides a customized and enhanced tool to streamline claims, automate
      eligibility determinations, payment processing, detection and prevention of
      improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing capabilities. In addition,
      VA continued with the post-implementation modernization of the beneficiary travel
      claims processing software and other systems. Further,VA continued planning
      for invoice payment processing nationwide, which is expected to improve the
      timeliness and accuracy of ambulance claims processing. Finally, VA transitioned
      from a legacy system to a new beneficiary travel claims processing system. Although
      the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY
      2024, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action implementation
      forward. These actions were designed to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of overpayments
    and underpayments were attributed to failure to access data/information, the cause
    of technically improper payments were attributed to statutory requirements of
    the program not met, and the cause of unknown payments were attributed to unable
    to determine whether proper or improper. In particular, the majority of overpayments
    occurred due to claim payments being calculated incorrectly. The majority of underpayments
    occurred because the claim was not paid according to contract terms. The majority
    of technically improper payments occurred because clinical documentation for special
    mode travel was not properly and timely approved by a VA clinician. The majority
    of unknown payments occurred because authorization documentation such as the non-VA
    care authorization or special mode travel or emergent ambulance document was not
    obtained. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted
    from manual processes and human error. Change process was the best mitigation
    strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within
    existing payment processes. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
    the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.
  act17_2: Actions taken regarding automation included continuing to implement new
    software that will provide a customized and enhanced tool to streamline claims,
    automate eligibility determinations, payment processing, detection and prevention
    of improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing capabilities. Additionally,
    VA continued with the post-implementation modernization of the beneficiary travel
    claims processing software and other systems. In addition, VA continued with the
    planning for utlizing an automated system to process invoice payments nationwide,
    which is expected to improve the timeliness and accuracy of ambulance claims processing.
    Finally, VA transitioned from a legacy system to a new beneficiary travel claims
    processing sytem. Actions taken regarding change process included establishing
    and deploying enterprise-wide infrastructure solutions to include quality assurance
    monitoring processes for mileage reimbursement and special mode transportation.
    Actions planned regarding training include developing new and enhanced claims
    processing trainings and deploying training resources across various stakeholder
    groups impacted to ensure more effective communication across target audiences.
    Additionally, VA will continue establishing and deploying enterprise-wide infrastructure
    solutions including reviewing the effectiveness of quality assurance and monitoring
    reporting processes and developing and implementing effective standardized processes.
    Actions planned regarding automation include VA will continue with the post-implementation
    modernization of beneficiary travel claims processing systems. VA enhanced automation
    action plans to expand use of transportation modalities that will streamline third-party
    preauthorized claims processing, integrate medical qualifications, and automate
    contract execution.
  act17_3: "VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results,\
    \ and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned\
    \ or taken are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper\
    \ and unknown payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on\
    \ a quarterly basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually\
    \ to measure if an action planned has reduced or is properly designed to reduce\
    \ improper and unknown payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark.\
    \ The annual effectiveness review process allows VA to create or update actions\
    \ as necessary to ensure continued progress in the remediation of improper and\
    \ unknown payments. If areas for improvement are identified, VA conducts a root\
    \ cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they\
    \ addressed and reduced root cause(s) of error. \n\nThrough implementation of\
    \ effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Beneficiary Travel reduced\
    \ overpayments from $88.50 million in FY 2023 to $86.22 million in FY 2024, or\
    \ a $2.28 million reduction despite a $91.78 million increase in outlays. VA has\
    \ increased the sample size in this program area to gain additional insight into\
    \ the root error causes occurring and plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective\
    \ actions related to these high-risk program areas. As part of the established\
    \ corrective action process, the program reported improved corrective action and\
    \ mitigation strategies planned for FY 2025."
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Beneficiary Travel reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown payment estimates.
    Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing
    VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper
    payments legislation is that it can take three to five years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

  cyp6_1: VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
    to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
    and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the
    right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper approval on medical qualification.
    Specifically, where clinical documentation for special mode travel was not properly
    and timely approved by a VA clinician. Most improper payments resulted from delinquent
    authorizations and lack of proper approval on medical qualification. These resulted
    in technically improper payments for failing to comply with 38 Code of Federal
    Regulations - Applications (Part 70.20), 38 Code of Federal Regulations - Criteria
    for approval (Part 70.4), and Federal Acquisition Regulation sections General
    (Part 1.601) and Policy (Part 43.102).

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate authorization of transport and care as well
    as contract pricing. However, the agency currently does not have the documentation
    necessary to determine if the payment is proper or not. VA was unable to locate
    authorization and receiving documentation, or complete contract rate schedules.
    Specifically, authorization documentation such as the non-VA care authorization
    or special mode travel or emergent ambulance document was not obtained. The missing
    documentation needed will assist VA in determining the clinical need for transport.
    Centralized documentation retention for each claim is not currently possible within
    the agencyâ€™s current systems of record environment. Hard copy evidence is often
    maintained locally for claims processing purposes. For this reason, we are unable
    to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without
    that documentation.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
    documentation related to authorization, receiving, eligibility, or pricing documentation
    that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or improper. Specifically,
    these unknown payments occur when the agency was unable to determine the Veteran's
    eligibility due to missing annual income documentation, medical authorization
    documentation, or incomplete contract price schedules. Without annual income eligibility,
    contract price schedules, receiving supporting documentation and special mode
    transportation or common carrier preauthorization documentation, if applicable,
    the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

      that could provide the Veteran's treatment was utilized, special mode transportation
      rates were correctly paid according to contract, if applicable, services were
      received, beneficiary met administrative and medical qualification, claim was
      timely submitted, claim was not a duplicate, or claim payments were calculated
      according to mileage and deductibles, if applicable. The agency has the direct
      ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving processes and controls
      surrounding administrative and medical qualifications, and simplifying contract
      pricing, when applicable, to include valid claim mileage calculations. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorizations, closest
      facility, and will ensure services are rendered, decreasing human error. These
      improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

  pro1: The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although
    Beneficiary Travel reported an increase in overall improper and unknown payments,
    projected improper and unknown payments remain under the 10% compliance threshold
    established by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for the fifth consecutive
    year. Further, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will increase
    its ability to reduce improper payments in the future. Through implementation
    of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Beneficiary Travel
    reduced overpayments from $88.50 million in FY 2023 to $86.22 million in FY 2024,
    or a $2.28 million reduction despite a $91.78 million increase in outlays. VA
    plans to expand and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to high-risk areas
    as well as increase the FY 2025 sample size to gain additional insight into the
    root cause errors occurring.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
    Office acknowledged VAâ€™s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
    using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VAâ€™s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
  rnp3: "The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement corrective\
    \ actions and mitigation strategies designed to reduce improper and unknown payments.\
    \ In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented\
    \ in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of\
    \ corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively\
    \ implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Beneficiary\
    \ Travel program indicated that of the four actions assessed, three were designed\
    \ effectively and one was designed ineffectively. If improvements could be made,\
    \ VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies\
    \ to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. \n\nThrough implementation\
    \ of effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies, Beneficiary Travel\
    \ reduced overpayments from $88.50 million in FY 2023 to $86.22 million in FY\
    \ 2024, or a $2.28 million reduction. Additionally, Beneficiary Travel experienced\
    \ a $91.78 million increase in outlays, specifically in program areas where errors\
    \ tend to occur. VA has increased the sample size in this program area to gain\
    \ additional insight into the root error cause(s) occurring and plans to expand\
    \ and enhance FY 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas.\
    \ For errors tied to failure to access data/information, errors tied to statutory\
    \ requirements of program not met, and errors tied to errors tied to unable to\
    \ determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation\
    \ strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024.\
    \ \n\nVA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action\
    \ plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop\
    \ and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this\
    \ review will be reported in FY 2025."
  rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
    General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for
    a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers and program
    personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as automation and training.
    These actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024 payment integrity
    testing. VAâ€™s executive managers to include the Deputy Executive Director for
    Member Services and program personnel will be held accountable through annual
    performance criteria contained within their performance plans. Performance criteria
    will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties. Depending on each employeesâ€™
    responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper and unknown payments
    through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments if appropriate, and
    implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper and unknown payments.
    State and local governments are not involved in the execution of this program.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper and
    unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively within
    existing budget authority.
