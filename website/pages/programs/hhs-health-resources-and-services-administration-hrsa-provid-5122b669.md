  pro1: Compared to FY 2022, FY 2023 represents a substantial reduction both in terms
    of the improper payment rate (from 0.32% in to 0.10%) and the actual dollar amount
    of improper payments (from $409.48 million to $22.31 million). The percent decrease
    in the improper payment rate from FY 2022 to FY 2023 is approximately 68.75%,
    which underscores the remarkable improvement in payment integrity performance.

  rap6: HHS did not submit any specific budget requests for the PRF program. Rather,
    the HHS recent budget submission is on HHS-wide activities and program support
    as it relates to PRF. HRSA made payments until June 2023, when the remaining unobligated
    funds for provider relief payments were rescinded.
  rnp3: "HHS continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and\
    \ mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments as evidenced by its two\
    \ consecutive year of reductions in total overpayments made. Specifically, from\

  act17_1: 'The actions takenby HRSA were focused on the causes of the improper payments
    in the PRF program because the varied assistance was targeted to address the three
    root causes of error identified. In FY 2024 PRF improper payments were due to:

    •input errors when calculating payments.

    •Provider was paid for expenses and/or losses that were reimbursed by other sources''
    could not be tested as the source documents

    •incorrect calculations as a result of the utilization incorrect percentage attributable
    to patient care revenue.'
  act17_2: The corrective actions taken to address payment calculation errors and
    supporting documentation deficiencies have been effective, as evidenced by the
    low improper payment rate and minimal non-monetary loss to the government discovered
    during testing. For instance, HRSA implemented post-payment reviews, audit strategies,
    reporting mechanisms, and system enhancements to bolster detection measures and
    ensure payment integrity. HRSA also rectified improper payments by making subsequent
    payments to affected providers with the accurate data, thereby ensuring that the
    correct total payments were issued to the provider.
  act17_3: As the PRF program advanced, standardized procedures for calculating payments
    and deductions were established. These practices involved using pay files and
    systems, verifying recipients for application-based payments, and conducting exploratory
    analysis to verify and confirm the payment history of recipients. Furthermore,
    HRSA introduced a shift from using whole number percentages to using dollar amounts
    for patient care revenue, which increased accuracy for providers.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: HHS expects the tolerable rate to remain the same due to internal controls,
    corrective actions and mitigations put in place, and the reduction to future outlays
    as the program progressed.

  pro1: Compared to FY 2022, FY 2024 represents a substantial reduction both in terms
    of the improper payment rate (from 0.32% in to 0.06%) and the actual dollar amount
    of improper payments (from $409.48 million to $3.78 million). The percent decrease
    in the improper payment rate from FY 2022 to FY 2024 is based on the significant
    reduction of payments.

    HRSA established standardized practices for calculating payments and deductions,
    involving pay files, systems, and verifying recipient eligibility and payment
    history through exploratory analysis.  Additionally, as the program matured, HRSA
    recorded and tracked standards and guidelines throughout the program lifecycle
    to avoid confusion and alleviate discrepancies.

  rap6: 'HRSA did not submit any specific budget requests for the PRF program. HRSA
    made payments until June 2023, when the remaining unobligated funds for provider
    relief payments were rescinded when the Fiscal Responsibility Act passed.

    '
  rnp3: From FY 2022 to FY 2024, HHS decreased its error rate from FY 2022 0.32%,
    FY 2023 0.10% and FY 2024 0.06% and improper payments from $409.48 million to
    $22.31 million and now $3.78 million in 2024 respectively. The vast majority of
    payments were completed before we started testing or knew any results.  After
    our first year of testing, the target we set for the second year was to maintain
    the same rate because the number of payments issued significantly decreased.
  rnp4: 'HHS has performance management programs to develop goals and strategies for
    staff through which success can be measured and rewarded. Performance Management
    Appraisal Program (PMAP) is one component of the ongoing process of performance
    management. It sets goals for performance and shares

    those goals while establishing the performance plan and required mid-year and
    annual review discussions.  PMAP includes two critical elements that track back
    to the HHS and HRSA strategic plan and align with the goals and initiatives of
    senior leadership. Administrative Requirements is one category of critical element
    that are required of all agency staff as part of their job duties and responsibilities
    to identify and address weaknesses to ensure recovery of improper payments and
    to reduce the number of improper payments made by the Department.'
