    in FY 2022. While the baseline for the program has not been established and the
    tolerable rate has not been identified, the program has taken steps to address
    the unknown payments identified at the conclusion of the study. For each unknown
    payment sample in the study, the responsible program office will provide a written
    determination whether the payment was proper or improper. The program offices
    will communicate to their subprogram grantees regarding obtaining and/or providing
    supporting documentation to the Department, as part of its efforts to comply with
    PIIA. Messaging to grantees will include establishing expectations by providing
    grantees with background on PIIA, the anticipated timeline, the importance of
    being attentive and responsive to the payment integrity team’s communications
    and requests, and the type of documentation requested under the Fiscal Year 2023
    methodology to substantiate sampled payments.

    cyp4_1: 'The overpayments encountered are outside of agency control due to the
      fact that the direct recipients of funds (State Education Agency''s or SEAs)
      acted as a pass-through entity to their sub-grantees, who were the ultimate
      recipients. As such, the Department processed the relevant payments to the SEA
      based on their internal controls and payment review process. Furthermore, these
      overpayments were due to rounding errors in most instances. Additionally, in
      certain cases where the Department did make the direct payment to the end user,
      the documentation submitted was seemingly sufficient except for minor rounding

      errors. The small amounts involved would not usually justify expending additional
      resources or time to have Department staff reperform the calculations.'
  pro1: "Unknown Payments (UPs) were the primary driver of this program’s high estimated\
    \ Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown Payment (UP) rate reported in FY22. The UPs\
    \ identified in FY22 were the result of lack of documentation due to the delayed\
    \ start of the study and the payment recipients not understanding what type of\
    \ supporting documentation to provide to satisfy the requirements of the study.\
    \ The Department implemented effective mitigation strategies in FY23 which resulted\
    \ in the elimination of UPs, and subsequently the significant reduction of the\
    \ estimated IP and UP rate in FY23. The strategies implemented are as follows:\n\
    \n1. The Department began the FY23 study earlier in the fiscal year, providing\
    \ sufficient time for State Education Agencies (SEAs) to obtain and provide supporting\
    \ documentation from Local Education Agencies (LEAs) for the program’s payments.\n\
    \n2. The Department also provided SEAs with targeted technical assistance and\
    \ training. This assistance encompassed technical assistance meetings with certain\
    \ states, written guidance, and payment documentation criteria guidance. \n\n\
    Additionally, The Department formally issued its policy on Payment Integrity,\
    \ providing guidance to agency employees, in Fiscal Year 2023."
  rap5: The program's reported improper and unknown payment estimate is below the
    statutory threshold; therefore, the program is not required to establish and publish
    a reduction target for the next Fiscal Year. With no reduction target established,
    the tolerable rate cannot be determined. While the tolerable rate for the Education
    Stabilization Fund program has not been identified, the program has the internal
    controls, human capital, information systems and other infrastructure to maintain
    low improper payments and unknown payments.
  rap6: The Department did not request additional resources. This program has well
    designed and effective internal controls in place.
  rnp3: A response is not applicable because the ESF program's IP and UP estimate
    is below the statutory threshold.

    cyp4_1: The ESF program experienced overpayments that were beyond the agency’s
      control, due to automatic rounding errors. These discrepancies occurred both
      within Excel and other system-based processes. Preventing rounding within system-based
      processes is inherently challenging. When rounding occurs in a system and is
      subsequently recalculated in Excel, discrepancies can arise, resulting in minor
      differences in amounts. Consequently, it is difficult for states to prevent
      these rounding errors, which is why they are classified as beyond the agency’s
      control.

  rnp4: 'Department personnel, including executive managers and staff, are held accountable
    for promoting payment

    integrity and maintaining effective internal controls in their day-to-day jobs.
    Key management officials have

    specific expectations related to payment integrity included in their annual performance
    plans. Program officials who administer programs deemed susceptible to significant
    improper payments are highly engaged in developing and implementing corrective
    actions as well as providing technical assistance for grantees to prevent improper
    payments for being made and to ensure payments are supported by sufficient documentation.
    Due to the improper payment and unknown payment estimate being below the statutory
    threshold, a reduction target is not required for this program.
