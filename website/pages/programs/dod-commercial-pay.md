      targets the Commercial Pay vendors who deliver the goods or perform the services
      to ensure payment accuracy. The Department’s Payment Integrity Commercial contractual
      payments require a three-way match between contract, invoice and goods receipt

      is another requirement which ensures funding in the amount of the payment is
      available in the respective accounting system.  In addition, each system has
      controls in place to prevent improper payments such as, duplicate payment logic.

  pro1: The Department’s Commercial Pay Payment Integrity program consists of payments
    disbursed by Defense Finance and Accounting Service, the Army, and the Navy to
    vendors and contractors for goods and services.  It also includes Disaster Relief
    and Coronavirus response funding payments made by the Military Services and DoD
    Components.

  rap6: The Commercial Pay Payment Integrity program did not have any specific Payment
    Integrity recent budget submissions, which the Office of the Under Secretary of
    Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team is aware.
  rnp3: In FY 2021, there were no total estimated improper and unknown payments identified
    for the Commercial Pay program.  As the amount of improper and unknown payments
    estimated in this program differed greatly from the results of payment recovery
    audit and activity (PRA) efforts, the Department performed an assessment of the
    Payment Integrity Commercial Pay program.  To ensure accuracy in reporting and
    streamline efforts, the Department developed a new Sampling & Estimation Methodology
    Plan (S&EMP), effective in FY 2022, designed in accordance with the Payment Integrity
    Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and the guidelines in the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix
    C.  The S&EMP also incorporates recommendations from the DoD Office of Inspector
    General and the Government Accountability Office.  In addition to the S&EMP, the
    DoD established a Program-wide Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to prioritize
    strategic payment integrity objectives while balancing the cost benefits and operational
    considerations to the Department.  In order to facilitate the collaborative efforts
    of various stakeholders throughout the Department, the Office of the Under Secretary
    of Defense (Comptroller) Payment Integrity Team, established the Payment Integrity
    Commercial Pay Compliance Working Group with the Military Departments and components
    of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. By establishing this Department
    objective of fully complying with the requirements of the PIIA the monthly working
    group contributed to the alignment of the Payment Integrity Program review operations
    and provided a platform for training and the flow of feedback across the Department.  Simultaneously
    with the Commercial Pay program revamp, the PRA Commercial Pay Working Group made
    great strides in streamlining the monitoring and recovery of overpayments made
    by the Department in an effort to ensure accuracy in reporting.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: The Department cannot establish an effective tolerable rate until the Department
    can produce reliable Payment Integrity estimates for the programs that are currently
    in Phase II. The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the previous
    Department estimates were unreliable and caused primarily by using an inappropriate
    variable which led to insufficient sample sizes, and incomplete universe of transactions
    (UoT) to pull the Payment Integrity sample population for testing. The Department
    has since implemented several DoD OIG recommendations by performing UoT reconciliations
    for the Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans
    and creating a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness
    of the population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment
    Integrity teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved
    by the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes
    by testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and
    process is anticipated to produce estimates that are more reliable and streamline
    the Department’s efforts to achieve Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) Compliance
    during the FY 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit. Once the Department has
    DoD OIG confirmed reliable estimates, the Department will be able to establish
    effective and cost beneficial tolerable rates for the Payment Integrity programs.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program did not have
      a formal corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on prior year findings.
      Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual improper payments
      plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the prior reporting
      year, the

      Department''s Commercial Pay program reported a total of $67.48 million in improper
      plus unknown payments, which is significantly below the statutory threshold.
      Hence, no specific corrective actions were taken for this program.


      The Department pursues continuous training actions for current and new employees
      throughout the Commercial Pay program. Additionally, through trend and root
      cause analysis specific training is provided to prevent improper

      payments for technician error. When the root cause is for other than technician
      error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana
      detection tool is continually monitored and evaluated to rank and rate proposed

    \ of the Under Secretary of the Defense (Comptroller) provides ongoing oversight\
    \ to ensure material weaknesses are resolved by their target dates and coordination\
    \ continues between the Risk Management/Internal Control Program and the Payment\
    \ Integrity Program to leverage best practices in internal controls.\n\nHuman\
    \ Capital:\nThe Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments\
    \ in the Commercial Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However,\
    \ as the Commercial Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional\
    \ skill sets and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and\nadvance the\
    \ program. \n\nInformation Systems and Other Infrastructure:\nThe Department has\
    \ the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper\
    \ payments in the Commercial Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.\
    \ The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Contract Pay, received an\
    \ unmodified System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement\
    \ on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2023. The general\
    \ and application controls of the  Mechanization of Contract Administration Services\
    \ System (which accounts for more than 50% of the outlays in the Commercial Pay\
    \ program) were included in the scope of the DFAS Contract Pay SSAE No. 18 examination.\
    \ Additionally, Wide Area Workflow, which is used to support the initiation, receipt,\
    \ and acceptance of electronic invoices submitted by DoD vendors, OnePay, Defense\
    \ Logistics Agency (DLA) Defense Agencies Initiative (DAI), and the Integrated\
    \ Accounts Payable System all received unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 reports under SSAE\
    \ No. 18 in\nFY 2022. And, the Computerized Accounts Payable System, DFAS DAI,\
    \ and DCMA Contract Pay each received modified SOC 1 Type 2 reports under SSAE\
    \ No. 18 in FY 2023. Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized\
    \ Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System (which are the primary\
    \ disbursing systems for the Department) received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report\
    \ under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. As technology advances, the Department continues\
    \ to consider ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency of commercial pay through\
    \ implementation of new commercial and entitlement processing systems and enhancements\
    \ to existing systems."
  rap6: The Commercial Pay program did not have any recent specific Payment Integrity
    budget submissions that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)
    Payment Integrity Team is aware.
  rnp3: "The Department's Commercial Pay program will establish Defense Finance and\
    \ Accounting Service (DFAS) site and commercial pay system-specific working groups\
    \ in fiscal year 2024. The primary purpose of this Department- wide working group\
    \ initiative to ensure the creation of the new standard operating\nprocedures\
    \ and appropriate milestones are established to reduce technically improper and\
    \ unknown payments associated with documentation retention to substantiate the\
    \ payments. DFAS Post Pay Review & Analysis team will provide training to review\
    \ teams regarding proper documentation required for government credit card transactions.\
    \ This Training will be provided to the review teams during the annual kick off\
    \ meeting on the appropriate documentation required to complete sample packages\
    \ along with specific examples of acceptable documentation.\n\nDepartment Commercial\
    \ Pay Working Groups will collaborate to identify the repository systems for payments\
    \ made under the Commercial Pay Program. Each DFAS Site responsible for payments\
    \ under the Commercial Pay program will determine whether the program lacks information\
    \ or data systems to confirm eligibility or provide for other payment integrity\
    \ needs. Furthermore the Department is establishing an additional Department wide\
    \ working group to perform a Risk Assessment to identify the causes and volume\
    \ of technically improper payments made when regulatory and/or statutory requirements\n\
    were not met to substantiate the payment. \n\nHistorically, the approach of creating\
    \ working groups with the Department subject matter experts has been highly effective\
    \ in reducing improper and unknown payments. Incorporating that methodology within\
    \ the established corrective action plan's additional anticipated milestones or\
    \ benchmarks has a proven track record of continuous reduction of the root causes\
    \ for improper and unknown payments."
