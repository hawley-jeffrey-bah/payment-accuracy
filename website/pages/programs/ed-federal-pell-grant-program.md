    IP do not result in the need for the program to recover funds due to overpayment.
    These technically IP are made by institutions receiving Pell Grant funding, often
    due to untimely disbursements of the aid to the student and/or return of unused
    funds to FSA, procedural deficiencies, or human error. These technically IPs are
    identified from compliance audit findings to include those related to untimely

    cyp4_1: 'The Pell Grant program structure per the Higher Education Act of 1965
      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). Errors made
      by institutions for incorrect financial aid determination, credit balance deficiencies,
      student withdrawal deficiencies, and documentation deficiencies are outside
      of FSA''s control.


      The HEA does provide FSA authority to require the intermediary to impose certain
      internal controls or mitigation strategies to prevent these IPs, and FSA exercises
      this authority. FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight
      functions to help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance
      by all participating institutions.'
  pro1: 'The Department places a high value on maintaining the integrity of all types
    of payments made to ensure that the billions of dollars in federal funds it disburses
    annually reach intended recipients in the right amount and for the right purpose,
    including for the Pell Grant program. The Department ensures payment integrity
    by establishing effective policies, business processes, systems, and controls
    over key payment activities, including those pertaining to: payment data quality,
    cash management, banking information, third-party oversight, assessments of audit
    reports, and financial reporting. Accordingly, the Department maintains a robust
    internal control framework that includes controls designed to help prevent, detect,
    and recover improper payments. In designing controls, the Department attempts
    to strike the right balance between making timely and accurate payments and ensuring
    that controls put in place are not too costly or overly burdensome and thereby
    deter intended beneficiaries from obtaining funds they are entitled to receive.'
  rap5: 'FSA has the internal controls, human capital, and information systems and
    other infrastructure needed to reduce IPs and UPs to the tolerable rate. FSA continues
    to implement a multi-year corrective action plan to implement the authorities
    provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from
    the IRS. This corrective action requires changes to existing FSA systems which
    are in process. Obtaining this data will prevent improper payments resulting from
    the applicant misreporting their income on the FAFSA.


    FSA must also continue to rely on controls established by external entities that
    receive funds and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including Pell Grants.
    These entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will continue to
    leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance audits to identify
    and address root causes of IPs and UPs made by external entities.'
  rap6: The Budget provides $2.7 billion for Student Aid Administration, including
    to the Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), a $620 million
    increase over the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. This additional funding is essential
    to support students and student loan borrowers. The increase would allow FSA to
    continue to operate the student aid programs, implement critical improvements
    to student loan servicing, continue to modernize its digital infrastructure, and
    ensure successful administration of the financial aid programs through a simplified
    and streamlined application process for students and borrowers.
  rnp3: 'Preventing IPs is a top Administration and agency priority. To effectively
    prevent IPs and UPs from occurring, FSA evaluates the root causes of IPs and UPs
    identified. This root cause analysis is used to help formulate effective correction
    actions and prioritize efforts to prevent IPs and UPs from occurring. For example,
    FSA''s most impactful root cause to its IP rate over the last five years has been
    IP due to misreported income. FSA has invested significant resources and worked
    cross-agency with the IRS to implement the authorities provided in the FUTURE
    Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from the IRS. Once implemented,
    this corrective action will eliminate misreported income on the FAFSA.


    For corrective actions that are implemented, FSA monitors the status of the corrective
    actions through quarterly outreach to corrective action owners, and collects closure
    evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and progress of each individual mitigation
    strategy which informs whether the corrective action can be refined, intensified,
    expanded, or should be discontinued or replaced.'

    \ impactful root cause of improper payments.\n\nFSA also prioritizes stakeholder\
    \ and community outreach and training, as these oversight activities are core\
    \ business functions. FSA annually implements procedures to perform trainings\
    \ and outreach, participates in trainings and outreach, and continually assesses\
    \ how to improve these areas. For example, FSA listens to stakeholder feedback\
    \ and publishes responses to questions from the community. FSA also invests significant\
    \ resources and efforts into training. For example, FSA annually holds the FSA\
    \ Training Conference and analyzes the attendance patterns of institutions and\
    \ their stakeholders, which allows FSA to understand attendance trends and develop\
    \ training content accordingly. As such, many offices within FSA collectively\

  cyp20_2: 'Based on FY 2024 results, the reduction target for the Pell Grant program
    for FY 2025 is 2.63% which is equal to the estimated future IP plus UP rate. In
    establishing a realistic reduction target for FY 2025, FSA considered existing
    program characteristics and whether achieving the established target was within
    or outside of the agency''s control. FSA determined that it has internal controls,
    human capital, information systems, and other infrastructure to reduce improper
    payments that are within FSA’s control. A key long-term corrective action to mitigate
    the primary root cause of misreported income which is within FSA''s control is
    the implementation of the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act. Once fully implemented
    in FY 2025, this corrective action should result in a reduction target below the
    tolerable rate.


    FSA must also continue to rely on controls established by external entities that
    receive funds and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including the Pell
    Grant program. Those entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will
    continue to leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance
    audits to identify and address root causes of improper payments made by external
    entities.

    IPs do not result in the need for the program to recover funds due to overpayment.
    These technically IPs are made by institutions receiving Pell Grant funding, often
    due to untimely disbursements of the aid to the student and/or return of unused
    funds to FSA, procedural deficiencies, or human error. These technically IPs are
    identified from compliance audit findings to include those related to untimely
    return of Title IV funds, untimely calculation of Title IV funds, incorrect disbursement
    timing, credit balance returned late, failure to properly complete verification,
    and professional judgement deficiencies.

      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). Errors made
      by institutions for incorrect financial aid determination, credit balance deficiencies,
      student withdrawal deficiencies, and documentation deficiencies are outside

      The HEA does provide FSA authority to require the intermediary to impose certain
      internal controls or mitigation strategies to prevent these IPs, and FSA exercises
      this authority. FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight
      functions to help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance

    of payments made to ensure that the billions of dollars in federal funds it disburses

    by establishing effective policies, business processes, systems, and controls
    over key payment activities, including those pertaining to: payment data quality,
    cash management, third-party oversight, assessments of audit reports, and financial
    reporting. Accordingly, the Department maintains a robust internal control framework
    that includes controls designed to help prevent, detect, and recover improper
    payments. In designing controls, the Department attempts to strike the right balance
    between making timely and accurate payments and ensuring that controls put in
    place are not too costly or overly burdensome and thereby deter intended beneficiaries
    from obtaining funds they are entitled to receive.

    the IRS. This corrective action requires changes to existing FSA systems which

    a $625 million increase over the fiscal year 2024 annualized continuing resolution
    level. This additional funding is essential to support students and student loan
    borrowers. The increase would allow FSA to continue to operate the student aid

  and certain post baccalaureate students to promote access to postsecondary education.
  Root causes of Pell overpayments include incorrect calculation of Return of Title
  IV funds, failure to return unclaimed credit balances to the Department, and failure
  to meet satisfactory academic progress. Barriers include the program structure of
  the Pell program, which requires that funds pass through an intermediary Non-Federal
  entity before reaching the ultimate beneficiary (student). The statute provides
  FSA authority to require the third-party to impose certain internal controls or
  mitigation strategies, and FSA exercises this authority.
