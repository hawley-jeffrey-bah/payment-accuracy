    \ processes, and improve accountability. Farm Service Agency’s aim is to not only\
    \ make these improvements at the program specific level but to initiate transformation\
    \ at the overall arching and broader Agency level. \n\nFarm Service Agency will\
    \ require key resources to continue its progression towards strengthening internal\
    \ controls and addressing the inconsistencies with certain programs reporting\
    \ more than the statutory improper payment threshold in fiscal year 2022.   \n\
    \nHuman Capital Needs: National and State Office Compliance Resources - To resolve\
    \ the Agency’s noncompliance issues in a timely manner, strengthen program integrity\
    \ and accountability and maintain an ongoing compliance oversight strategy, additional\
    \ compliance staff will be crucial for Farm Service Agency to build a comprehensive\
    \ and robust compliance program.  \n\nFarm Service Agency once had staff positions\
    \ whose main responsibility involved monitoring and addressing compliance related\
    \ issues within states known as Farm Service Agency County Operations Reviewer,\
    \ but these positions were transferred in fiscal year 2019 from Farm Service Agency\
    \ to the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center, Performance, Accountability\
    \ and Risk Division during the Farm Production and Conservation Business Center\
    \ reorganization.  This transfer caused a hardship on Farm Service Agency’s internal\
    \ controls program and significant resource and specialized knowledge gaps are\
    \ still prevalent today, which is contributing to Farm Service Agency’s capacity\
    \ to timely and adequately address various compliance issues and requirements.\
    \  Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are evaluating\
    \ the current set up to seek improvements as it relates to Farm Service Agency\
    \ program compliance.  In addition, Farm Service Agency’s existing staff continues\
    \ to be stretched with the responsibilities of training new staff, administering\
    \ Farm Service Agency programs, performing existing County Operations Reviewers\
    \ duties, and addressing new compliance requirements, all as collateral duties.\
    \ Farm Service Agency and Performance, Accountability and Risk Division are developing\
    \ a new work plan to better address this issue and goal by first quarter fiscal\
    \ year 2023 to define an improved workplan to support compliance review.\n\nInformation\
    \ Systems’ Needs – Farm Service Agency is positioning itself to take preventive\
    \ measures through automated processes that are built into business systems to\
    \ reduce errors.  Automation improves productivity and enforces procedural compliance;\
    \ therefore, Farm Service Agency is exploring better approaches to integrate internal\
    \ controls functions into the implementation of programs, as well as maintenance\
    \ of an existing program systems. Given these efforts, the Agency is planning\
    \ to request Congressional funding for enhancing:  1) transactional program systems/software\
    \ to quickly meet the implementation demands of pandemic, emergency, and disaster\
    \ programs and 2) interface systems to allow data sharing and eliminate manual/duplicative\
    \ entries and processes. \n\nSeveral transactional program systems and software\
    \ “work arounds” and manual processes still exist that are contributing to the\
    \ increase of program improper payments. Funding is needed to resolve current\
    \ deficiencies and build internal controls requirements within these systems.\
    \ \n\nFrom an internal controls oversight perspective, Farm Service Agency has\
    \ invested in the Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System and continues\
    \ to incorporate manual-paper based program reviews and spot-checks into automated\
    \ processes within the system.  The objectives for Internal Review Documentation\
    \ and Tracking System are to improve oversight capabilities to State and National\
    \ program managers, supplement data mining efforts and formally document review\
    \ results for program analysis and enrichment. This effort is ongoing and is planned\
    \ through fiscal year 2024. \n\nOther Infrastructures Needs - As part of the Agency’s\
    \ new integrated compliance plan, the design will incorporate further actions\
    \ to address meeting program reduction targets, including but not limited to:\
    \ 1) changing the current sampling methodology to using better sound statistical,\
    \ survey, and data collection methodologies that elevate past issues of  “oversampling”\
    \ and inefficient use of resources, while also ensuring the program dollars are\
    \ delivered to all producers who are legally entitled to them; 2) utilizing a\
    \ risk-based approach, where program risks and risk tolerances are identified\
    \ to allow the right internal controls to be put in place, establish program metrics\
    \ that gages the success of meeting objectives and need for improvements; 3) integrating\
    \ a more proactive use of data mining to identify program key performance indicators,\
    \ anomalies, fraud, waste, and abuse; and 4) performing a validity reassessment\
    \ of current program oversight processes, such as oversight checklists, redelegation\
    \ of authorities for approvals, etc.  \n\nThese actions will also assist in capturing\
    \ program impacts to targeted arenas of the historically underserved groups and\
    \ determining where increased efforts are needed to improve accessibility to Farm\
    \ Service Agency programs and services. For example, implementing routine sampling\
    \ of denied applications on historically underserved groups to verify if approval\
    \ and disapproval decisions are being made accurately. \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ is also coordinating with Farm Production and Conservation Business Center and\
    \ the Department on the multi-year data management efforts to improve transparency,\
    \ data mining, intelligence dashboards, and program analysis.  Equally, significant\
    \ investments in the development and utilization of program dashboards and visualizations\
    \ have been made by Farm Service Agency.  These efforts are helping to increase\
    \ transparency, augment analytics capacity and make data readily available to\
    \ support important mission-focused decision-making.  \n\nFarm Service Agency\
    \ has built a number of dashboards to provide visualizations for its major Farm\
    \ Programs and Farm Loan Programs, such as Coronavirus Food Assistance Program\
    \ 1, Coronavirus Food Assistance Program 2, Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity\
    \ Program Plus, Dairy Margin Coverage, Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss\
    \ Coverage, Conservation Reserve Program, Farm Loan Program Direct Loan Portfolio,\
    \ Farm Loan Program Loan Obligations, program payments, acreage reporting, etc.\
    \  Nationwide administrative dashboards to view office workload, productivity,\

    strategies that will improve program processes and establish accountability measures
    for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 and for fiscal year 2023. Throughout the
    fiscal year, National, State, and County program managers will continue to evaluate
    areas where policy needs revising or to be clarified, and additional training

    payments.  The agency will continue to strategically take the necessary steps
    to strengthen internal control measures, establish uniform consistency for compliance
    processes, and improve accountability. A continuous evaluation system which monitors
    the effectiveness of internal controls is in place but is not sufficient to reduce
    improper payments rates.  Lastly, agency will require key resources to continue
    its progression towards strengthening internal controls and addressing the inconsistencies
    with certain programs reporting more than the statutory improper payment threshold.

    Description_Action_Taken: The root cause of these improper payments was failure
      to access data information. Livestock Forage Disaster Program is currently part
      of Farm Service Agency’s Internal Control roadmap to improve program processes.  1.
      Currently in development is an improper payment trend analysis tool that has
      Fiscal Year 2019-2023 improper payment data.  The tool will identify staff,
      county offices and states with continued improper payment findings.  The tool
      will allow the agency to target county offices and staff for targeted training
      along with holding employees accountable, if warranted after training has been
      provided.  2.  Standardized Training policy for Farm Programs is part of the
      internal control roadmap for Fiscal Year 2025.  Training guidance would provide
      standardization for Headquarters, State and County level training.

    Description_Action_Taken: The root cause of these improper payments was failure
      to access data information. In order to fully mitigate these errors, program
      software will need to be modified, specifically to incorporate reading an applicant’s
      farm records to properly identify owners, operators, and other tenants and perform
      other cross checks to ensure the proper supporting documentation such as a lease
      or CCC-855 has been completed for the associated grazed acreage claimed.  Currently,
      Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded
      to enhance existing software.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit
      Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit
      Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills to support
      this effort.  Estimated funding requirements for this system enhancement is
      $2 million.

  act17_1: The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements of
    program not met.  The agency has established various task forces that consist
    of State and county office specialists to discuss issues, findings, and suggest
    solutions relating to administrative errors in the failure to obtain the required
    supporting documentation and proper acreage reporting. The outcome was identifying
    needed software enhancements, developing training opportunities, and issuing policy
    updates in agency handbooks.  These corrective actions are focused on the cause
    of the improper payments.
  act17_2: The root cause of these improper payments was statutory requirements of
    program not met.  Corrective actions such as training and awareness have had a
    positive impact, which is represented in a reduction in Livestock Forage Disaster
    Program’s Payment Integrity Information Act error rate in Fiscal Year 2024 compared
    to Fiscal Year 2023. Overall, Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper payment
    percentage has remained between 9-13 percent for the last three years, which included
    many pandemic and disaster related ad hoc programs which were being administered
    during this time with limited resources. These corrective actions are adequate
    to address the cause of the improper payments.
  act17_3: "Actions taken to reduce Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper payment\
    \ percentage have been effective.  In August 2018. Farm Service Agency released\
    \ a software update that integrated the Crop Acreage Reporting System software\
    \ in the Livestock Forage Disaster Program application software.  With this implementation,\
    \ acres or animal units are now interfaced directly from producer acreage reports,\
    \ which are a requirement for Livestock Forage Disaster Program, directly into\
    \ the Livestock Forage Disaster Program application software.  This replaced the\
    \ manual entries and significantly mitigated errors of calculating the total of\
    \ eligible acreage.   In Fiscal Year 2021, Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s\
    \ improper payment percentage decreased to 8 percent.  Livestock Forage Disaster\
    \ Program’s improper payment percentage has increased in two of the last three\
    \ fiscal years in part due to increased participation in Livestock Forage Disaster\
    \ Program, and a lack of funding for software enhancements. \n\nActions taken\
    \ enhancing software to interface eligible acreage or animal units and establishing\
    \ Livestock Forage Disaster Program monthly trainings with State Livestock Forage\
    \ Disaster Program specialists, raising improper payment awareness. All actions\
    \ have contributed to reducing Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper payment\
    \ percentage. These corrective actions will be effectively implemented and prioritized\
    \ within the agency to reduce improper payments.\n"
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: With the implementation of the current corrective actions and the planned
    corrective actions for the program, it is the agency’s anticipation that the projected
    reduction target will be less than the estimated future improper payment rate.

  cyp6: '134.9'
  cyp6_1: The root cause for this category was related to not following statutory
    requirements primarily with acreage reporting, supporting documentation, and delegations
    of authority rules.  Acreage reporting requirements were not followed properly,
    predominantly with late-filed acreage reports incorrectly loaded into the software.  Applications
    were also acted upon by a representative without proper redelegation of authority
    in place or without the required supporting documentation submitted prior to approval.  Statute
    requires Livestock Forage Disaster Program payments are made based on these areas
    being compliant.

    cyp2: '102.19'
    cyp2_1: 'The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data
      information, and the overpayments were within the agency control (program administered
      by the Farm Service Agency).


      These errors primarily involve administrative oversights such as failure to
      obtain supporting documentation and written leases or form CCC-855 Lease Certification
      to support the application, and failure to ensure the lease documentation complies
      with the established policies.  Through software enhancements and training on
      proper processes for obtaining required supporting documentation and written
      leases/CCC-855 Lease Certifications, these corrective actions should reduce
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s overall improper payment dollars and percentage.  However,
      in order to effectively reduce the improper payments, system enhancements are
      required.  Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately
      funded to modify software to incorporate farm record data to properly identify
      owners, operators, and other tenants and other cross checks to alert County
      office staff of the need for special processing. Farm Service Agency will request
      Commodity Credit Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year

  rap5: A tolerable rate for Livestock Forage Disaster Program has not been established;
    however, the Agency is in the process of establishing additional internal controls
    for its permanent programs such as Livestock Forage Disaster Program. For example,
    Farm Service Agency is in the process of establishing a monitoring system to assure
    that county offices review payments before being issued. The system also has an
    accountability component to identify offices that struggle to disburse proper
    payments. Once implemented, Farm Service Agency will be in a position to determine
    a tolerable rate based on established data.  Farm Service Agency will request
    Commodity Credit Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025
    Commodity Credit Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills.  Estimated
    funding requirements for system enhancement is $2 million.
  rap6: In order to reduce Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s improper payments,
    system enhancements and training for staff is required; however, Farm Service
    Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to implement the
    requested enhancements.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit Corporation
    Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation
    budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills.  Estimated funding requirements
    for system enhancement is $2 million.
  rnp3: Incorrect acreage reporting has been a reoccurring finding for Livestock Forage
    Disaster Program. Accurate accounting can be complex when producers have multiple
    fields, and especially in multiple counties, or when determined animal units are
    converted to acres. While training has kept these findings from increasing, automation
    enhancements are needed to fully assure that administrative errors are mitigated,
    however funding has not been available.  Specific national training has been conducted
    as recently as July 15-19, 2024. All trainings are recorded and posted on Deputy
    Administrator for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Program Training site. Further,
    Safety Net Division holds monthly Livestock Forage Disaster Program trainings
    with State Office Livestock Forage Disaster Program specialists to discuss findings
    and address any questions. All calls are recorded and posted on Deputy Administrator
    for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Disaster Program Training SharePoint site.
    These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate the program’s $134.90 million
    of improper payment dollars related to statutory requirements not met.
  rnp4: "Farm Service Agency has incorporated an accountability mechanism into the\
    \ performance plans applicable to supervisory positions, as specified in Notice\
    \ PM-3065 “Fiscal Year 2023 Performance Plans” (published December 5, 2022), to\
    \ ensure adequate internal controls compliance for all programs are in place to\
    \ improve future program delivery and reduce improper payments. The standards\
    \ require supervisors to: \n  \n•\tTimely address any Payment Integrity Information\

    \ \n\n\n·\tJohn J. Berge, Acting Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs\n·\tMarcus\
    \ Graham, Deputy Administrator for Field Operations\n"
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The agency’s target rate for Livestock Forage Disaster Program is to have
    an improper payment percentage below 10 percent, however this may not represent
    the definition of a “tolerable rate”.  All corrective actions taken by the agency
    have been implemented with the goal to be within the 10 percent threshold.
