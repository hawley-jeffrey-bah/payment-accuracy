    Description_Action_Taken: Training was provided to SBA review staff on the following
      topics and issues related to PPP Forgiveness.  Reviewers are trained to review
      loan and portfolio data including to confirm  borrower eligibility and confirm,
      the loan amount calculation to ensure the borrower did not apply for a loan
      forgiveness amount in excess of the maximum eligible loan amount. In addition,
      reviewers are trained on the process of confirming that the forgiveness amount
      requested is in accordance with PPP rules, that payroll costs are reasonable,
      ad that non- payroll costs are adequately documented.

    '
  cyp8: In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit conducted by OIG, the SBA
    separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
    PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases, and subsequently initiated the improper payments
    review process shortly after. SBA generated the loan sample and requested supporting
    documentation from lenders. In many instances, PPP loans forgiveness requests
    were submitted via SBA’s forgiveness platform and, although the lenders and borrowers
    were required to retain supporting documentation, they were not required to submit
    that documentation to SBA. For several of the PPP loans reviewed as part of the
    forgiveness sample, lenders had to request documents from borrowers. SBA asked
    lenders to submit their documents as soon as possible. As a result of the compressed
    time between documentation requests and reporting improper payment rates, many
    borrowers and lenders were unable to provide complete documentation. Those PPP
    loans with documentation requests outstanding were categorized as “Unknown” payments
    since SBA did not have sufficient supporting documentation to make a determination
    as to whether the forgiveness payment was proper or improper.

  pro1: 'The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to
    provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses to
    keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SBA separated
    PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals, PPP Forgiveness,
    and PPP Purchases.  PPP ended in May 2021.  Although no new PPP funds are being
    disbursed, borrowers may still request forgiveness for a PPP loan and lenders
    may request guaranty purchase of a PPP loan.  SBA is reporting under PIIA on these
    aspects of the program.

    The PPP loans can be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest
    on mortgages, rent, utilities, or other eligible expenses. A borrower can apply
    for forgiveness once all loan proceeds for which the borrower is requesting forgiveness
    have been used. Borrowers can apply for forgiveness any time up to up to 5 years
    from the date that SBA issued the loan number.  If borrowers do not apply for
    forgiveness within 10 months after the last day of the covered period, then PPP
    loan payments are no longer deferred, and borrowers will begin making loan payments
    to their PPP lender.


    PPP loan forgiveness requests were submitted via SBA’s forgiveness platform and,
    although the lenders and borrowers were required to retain supporting documentation,
    they were not required to submit that documentation to the SBA.  In FY2024, SBA
    requested supporting documentation from lenders in order to review to propriety
    of  PPP forgiveness samples.  SBA reviewed samples to determine whether the borrower
    was eligible for an SBA loan under 13 CFR 120.110, and whether the borrower met
    all other regulatory criteria for a PPP loan.

    '
  rap5: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and
    unknown payments to the reduction target.
  rap6: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission
    of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: The predominate reasons for improper payments in PPP Loan Forgiveness were
    missing or incomplete documentation, and borrower and lender errors in calculation.   A
    quality control review or internal escalation may help to catch these improper
    payments.
  rnp4: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
    process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable reduction
    targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and recovering overpayments.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: SBA has not established a tolerable rate for PPP Loan Forgiveness as loans
    under the PPP are no longer being made. With each loan forgiveness payment the
    program gets smaller and smaller.
