    homeowners recover from declared disasters. Disaster assistance is available to
    all businesses located within a declared disaster area, private non-profit organizations,
    homeowners, and renters affected by declared disasters. Disaster assistance loans
    can be used to pay for personal or business losses not covered by insurance or
    funding from other government agencies, as well as for business operating expenses
    that could have been met had the disaster not occurred.  The Disaster Assistance
    Loan Program is a direct loan program, meaning that SBA approves and makes the
    loans and there are no intermediary lenders.


    The Disaster Assistance Loan program reviews for Improper Payments were conducted
    to determine whether loans were materially in compliance with SBA guidance, including
    to determine whether borrowers were eligible for the Disaster Assistance loan,
    whether the amount approved was correct, whether the loan was made in accordance
    with existing regulations, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and other internal
    guidance.

    Disaster Assistance Loan samples are selected from loan disbursements.  A disaster
