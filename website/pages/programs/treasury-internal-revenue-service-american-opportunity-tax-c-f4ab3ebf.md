  rap6: "The IRS has internal controls in place to verify eligibility when data is\
    \ available.  Treasury and IRS analyses have consistently found that refundable\
    \ tax credit (RTC) overclaims are largely attributable to the statutory design\
    \ and complex eligibility requirements, and not rooted in internal control weaknesses,\
    \ financial management deficiencies, or reporting failures.  Therefore, the IRS\
    \ works with Treasury to develop legislative proposals that will improve RTC compliance\
    \ and reduce erroneous payments. \n\nFor  FY 2021 , the Administration included\
    \ the following proposals in its Budget submission:\n\nProvide the IRS with greater\
    \ flexibility to address correctable errors: This proposal would have  expanded\
    \ the instances in which the IRS could correct a taxpayer’s return including cases\
    \ where: (1) the information provided by the taxpayer does not match the information\
    \ contained in government databases or Form W-2, or from other third party databases\
    \ as the Secretary of the Treasury determines by regulation; (2) the taxpayer\
    \ has exceeded the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit; or (3) the\
    \ taxpayer has failed to include with his or her return certain documentation\
    \ that is required to be included on or attached to the return. This proposal\
    \ would make it easier for the IRS to correct obvious taxpayer errors, directly\
    \ improving tax compliance and reducing EITC and other RTC overclaims.\n\nIncrease\
    \ Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers: This proposal would have explicitly\
    \ provided that the Secretary of the Treasury have the authority to regulate all\
    \ paid tax return preparers. This would promote high-quality services from paid\
    \ tax preparers, decrease collection costs, increase revenues, and increase confidence\
    \ in the tax system.\n\nFor  FY 2022 , the Administration again included in its\
    \ Budget submission increased oversight of paid tax return preparers as a proposal,\
    \ as well as the following additional proposal:\n\nIncrease penalties on ghost\
    \ preparers: The proposal would increase the penalty amount to the greater of\
    \ $500 per return or 100 percent of the income derived per return by a ghost preparer.\
    \ The proposal would also increase the limitations period during which the penalty\
    \ may be assessed from three years to six years.  The proposal would be effective\
    \ for returns required to be filed after December 31, 2021.\n"

  cyp20_2: The FY 2023 Estimated Improper Payment Rate is the same as the FY 2022
    Improper Payment Rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in RTC improper payments will
    be ineffective. The RTC statute is such that IRS has limited authority to make
    changes to the claims during return processing. More so, most of the eligibility
    and credit determination requirements depends on factors that are not fundamentally
    known by the IRS at the time of filing. The IRS heavily relies on taxpayer-provided
    information without verifiability by third-party sources. The complexity of the
    law contributes to confusion around eligibility requirements and is one of the
    major contributing factors of improper payments. Error prevention and recoveries
    are achieved through time-consuming and resource-intensive examinations and other
    compliance activities. IRS does not have the resources to audit every return claiming
    RTCs, and the adjustments able to be attained through this process are small relative
    to the amount of improper payments estimated for the program. Without legislative
    change to greatly improve effective tools to administer these credits, the improper
    payment rate will not drastically change.

  rap5: 'To reduce overclaim rates to less than 10 percent, to meet Payment Integrity
    Information Act (PIIA) compliance standards, the IRS estimated, in a Fiscal Year
    2021 study, that it would need additional or reallocated resources of $2.5 billion
    to audit 4.2 million additional RTC returns in the pre-refund environment. If
    the IRS must reallocate enforcement resources to be compliant with PIIA, a substantial
    loss in enforcement revenue, estimated at $6.4 billion, would result because the
    IRS would divert resources from more valuable programs and tax gap elements to
    audits of RTC returns. Moreover, such enforcement actions would place substantial
    burden on low-income taxpayers through increased audits and delayed refunds, violating
    the IRS requirement of enforcing the tax law with integrity and fairness. As such,
    IRS has long held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is
    a more efficient and

    cost effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections. We further
    support the reporting of RTC overclaims within the Tax Gap Analysis to reflect
    better how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.'
  rap6: "For  FY 2023 , the Administration included the following proposals in its\
    \ Budget submission:\n\n(1) Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers.\n\
    The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the\
    \ Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all paid preparers of Federal\
    \ tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards.\n\
    \n(2) Expand and increase penalties for return preparation and e-filing – \nThe\
    \ proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance\
    \ or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.\
    \ First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers\
    \ for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms\
    \ of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax. Second, the proposal\
    \ would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification\
    \ Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\nNumbers (EFINs) and for\
    \ failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. Third, the proposal\
    \ would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure\
    \ to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years\
    \ to six years. Fourth, the proposal would clarify the\nSecretary’s authority\
    \ to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the authorized\
    \ e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions to protect\
    \ the integrity of the e-file program."

    cyp4_1: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), to include the lack
      of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that
      tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of AOTC improper payments.
      Specifically, at the time of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily authenticate
      eligibility i.e., whether the dependent/student in fact qualifies, meeting the
      many nuances of the qualifying education expenses. This is due to the fact that
      the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist.
      In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer misreporting
      of eligibility requirements, such as qualifying tuition expenses, Adjusted Gross
      Income, filing status, deductions, exemptions, and credits. Finally, each year
      there are many taxpayers who receive AOTC for the first time, who have to understand
      and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and design for administering
      refundable tax credit refunds, including AOTC, prevents the IRS from verifying
      or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a refund.
  rap5: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce American Opportunity
    Tax Credit (AOTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate.
    The issue with AOTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around AOTC and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff.
  rap6: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
    its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number of
    correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits, including
    the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). Focusing on helping taxpayers submit
    accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative
    burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
  rnp3: The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data sharing
    with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts are adequate measures
    because they will continue to aid the Service in mitigating the impact of the
    root causes. Much of the difficulty administering the American Opportunity Tax
    Credit (AOTC) derives from the complexity of its statutory eligibility requirements,
    many of which are known only to the taxpayer and cannot be independently confirmed
    using third-party corroborating data. Likewise, the primary root causes of improper
    payments of the AOTC are the  inability to authenticate eligibility at return
    filing because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting
    related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported
    to the IRS by a third party. Nevertheless, the IRS has a strong and effective
    internal control environment around refundable tax credit programs and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations.
  rtp1: Unknown
  rtp4_2: Similar to the previous year, IRS has not yet determined a tolerable rate.
    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action. Accordingly,
    the IRS does not have a current target date to report the tolerable rate.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). Based on analysis of prior-year data,
      the IRS refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods
      of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the
      process. Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters
      to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned throughout
      the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes
      of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is reliance on taxpayer self-certification
      of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers
      are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional
      and intentional) can occur. Improved audit selection filters can catch these
      issues after returns are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce
      improper payments. The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting
      of resources to areas in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning
      its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing
      in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund
      audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors
      that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for
      which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without
      substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to educate tax professionals on
      their due diligence requirements regarding the American Opportunity Tax Credit
      (AOTC), through venues such as the annual IRS Nationwide Tax Forums and the
      Latino Tax Fest. These events provide a platform for the IRS to reach a broad
      audience of tax preparers, helping them understand their obligations when assisting
      taxpayers in claiming the AOTC. This is important because a root cause of AOTC
      improper payments is misunderstanding the eligibility criteria for the credit.
      Because tax preparers assist in filing returns claiming refundable tax credits
      (RTCs), any lack of awareness or lack of oversight at the preparer level has
      a cascading effect on improper payments. Training will help clarify what is
      required to substantiate claims, such as documentation for qualifying educational
      expenses. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives;
      accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu
      of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate
      returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers
      claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS educated tax professionals on their due diligence
      requirements regarding the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). This training
      was delivered through prominent venues, including the annual IRS Nationwide
      Tax Forums and the Latino Tax Fest. These events provided a platform for the
      IRS to reach a broad audience of tax preparers, helping them understand their
      obligations when assisting taxpayers in claiming the AOTC. The training focused
      on specific key due diligence requirements, such as verifying that educational
      expenses being claimed were eligible for the credit, ensuring that the taxpayer
      or their dependent was enrolled in a qualifying educational institution and
      understanding the income limits associated with the credit. The IRS is investing
      in outreach and education of tax preparers and taxpayers, in lieu of conducting
      additional pre-refund audits. An additional root cause of AOTC improper payments
      is misunderstanding of the eligibility criteria for the credit. Because tax
      preparers assist in filing returns claiming RTCs, any lack of awareness or lack
      of oversight at the preparer level has a cascading effect on improper payments.
      Training addresses this root cause by equipping tax professionals with knowledge
      to claim RTCs accurately.

    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the American
      Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for
      next filing season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to
      fine-tune criteria used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example,
      patterns from prior filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining
      the IRS filters the IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods
      of errors and prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process.
      As mentioned throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management,
      the primary root causes of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs)
      are reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack
      of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their
      eligibility for RTCs upfront (as would be the case with a traditional payment
      program), errors can occur due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding
      of key point of eligibility. Improved audit selection filters can catch these
      issues after returns are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce
      improper payments. The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting
      of resources to areas in which errors are most likely to occur.

  act17_1: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
    such as the  American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), is the complexity of the
    credits'' statutory eligibility requirements. As a result, the key root causes
    of RTC improper payments are as follows:  (1) the lack of a preapproval process
    and inability to authenticate eligibility at the point of return filing; (2) taxpayer
    misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility, especially
    for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties;
    and (3) the inability for the IRS to wholesale deny refunds. Because of these
    root causes, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate
    return. The IRS has implemented a series of corrective actions focused on mitigating
    these root causes. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings focus on reviewing
    and adjusting compliance filters used in audit selection, which allows the IRS
    to detect errors earlier. The IRS also cross-collaborates with the Department
    of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Social Security Administration (SSA) and
    the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to share data that would enable
    the IRS to identify discrepancies in taxpayer claims. Finally, the IRS has invested
    in taxpayer education and outreach efforts, through such venues as the IRS''s
    Nationwide Tax Forums and Latino Tax Fest, to educate tax preparers about their
    responsibilities to verify taxpayer eligibility before filing claims. The IRS
    is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly,

    issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS. All
    of these corrective actions are strategically designed to address the root causes
    of improper payments by improving the accuracy of filed returns and mitigating
    the risks associated with taxpayer self-certification.'
  act17_2: The regulatory structure of refundable tax credits (RTCs), which lacks
    a pre-approval process and causes the IRS to rely heavily on taxpayer self-certification
    that their returns claiming RTCs are accurate, is a key factor contributing to
    RTC improper payments. Despite these constraints, the IRS has strategically designed
    corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments by improving

    on the magnitude of the root causes they address and the potential impact of each
    action on reducing improper payments. Data-driven analyses are critical in determining
    which area gain focus. For example, the IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further

    are continuously monitored, effectively implemented and reprioritized based on
    their ability to address the root causes of RTC improper payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: 'The FY 2025 estimated improper payment rate is the same as the FY 2024
    improper payment rate. The unique nature of tax administration means that traditional
    target-setting as a means of approaching reductions in refundable tax credit (RTC)
    improper payments will be ineffective. The RTC statute is such

    that IRS has limited authority to make changes to the claims during return processing.
    More so, most of the eligibility and credit determination requirements depends
    on factors that are generally not known by the IRS at the time of filing. The
    IRS heavily relies on taxpayer provided information without verifiability

    by third-party sources. The complexity of the law contributes to confusion around
    eligibility requirements and is one of the major contributing factors to improper
    payments. Error prevention and recoveries are achieved through time-consuming
    and resource-intensive examinations and other compliance activities. IRS does
    not have the resources to audit every return claiming RTCs, and the adjustments
    able to be attained through this process are small relative to the amount of improper
    payments estimated for the program. Without legislative change to greatly improve
    effective tools to administer these credits, the improper payment rate will not
    change significantly.'

    cyp4_1: These overpayments outside of agency control include the inability to
      authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      outside of agency control also include the inability to authenticate data due
      to program design limitations. Barriers caused by program design occur when
      information needed to confirm payment accuracy is not available at the time
      the return is processed.
  rap5: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
    and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
    (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue with
    RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
    The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
    based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
    capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Treasury
    Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported that
    the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


    Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
    restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
  rap6: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs will\
    \ take actions beyond our control.  We have proposed various legislative changes\
    \ over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing RTCs.  For\
    \ the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the following proposals:\
    \ \n\n1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The\
    \ proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance\
    \ or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.\
    \  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return\
    \ preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as\
    \ for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second,\
    \ the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer\
    \ Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers\
    \ (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer. \
    \ Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the penalty\
    \ for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from\
    \ three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s\
    \ authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate\
    \ in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions\
    \ to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\n2. Increase Oversight of\
    \ Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code (Money\
    \ and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate all\
    \ paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory minimum\
    \ competency standards. \n\nThese statutory changes may help reduce RTC errors\
    \ to some degree.  However, a meaningful reduction in the estimated error rate\
    \ is unlikely without independent data sources through which the IRS can verify\
    \ taxpayer-provided information and additional time and resources for the IRS\
    \ to address any issues identified."
  rnp3: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
    do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The fundamental
    root cause of RTC improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack
    of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments
    (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility
    belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available
    at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification
    that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed within and follow the
    regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement. At a lower level, the
    root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a) there is an inability
    to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series of complex eligibility
    rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing with many nuances);
    (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported, particularly related
    to self-employment income and other income not reported to the IRS by a third
    party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayers who receive certain credits for
    the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements of claiming the
    credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does not have the capability
    to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math authority. However, the
    IRS''s information technology platform includes a number of filters that the IRS
    uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility rules and payment
    certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data
    sharing with other federal agencies, and outreach/education efforts aid the IRS
    in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the IRS has a number of
    outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers and tax preparers
    understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate returns claiming RTCs.'
  rnp4: "The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable credit\
    \ programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.\
    \  The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits compliance plan\
    \ that addresses erroneous claims.  Each year the IRS updates its strategy using\
    \ the most recent research findings, prior year audit results, TIGTA/GAO audit\
    \ findings and legislative updates.  The IRS also submits legislative proposals\
    \ which, if approved by Congress, may further enhance efforts to address areas\
    \ of risk and reduce improper payments. \n \nThe IRS reviews and updates Internal\
    \ Revenue Manuals throughout the year and ensures that IRS employees who administer\
    \ refundable credits receive annual training and have the requisite knowledge\
    \ to address the evolving nature of improper payments and fraud.  Employees are\
    \ also encouraged to recommend changes that may further strengthen the IRS's internal\
    \ controls and procedures.\n \nThe IRS performance plans also balance the outreach\
    \ and awareness component with its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to\
    \ find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the knowledge of taxpayers\
    \ and paid return preparers of the eligibility and criteria for RTCs.\n\nReducing\
    \ the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant\
    \ restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action."
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: "Similar to previous years, reporting a tolerable rate has not been determined\
    \ for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. It is important to note the Refundable\
    \ Tax Credits (RTCs) do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program.\
    \ The primary root causes of improper payments of RTCs are the inability to authenticate\

    \ income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where\
    \ the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Put simply, payment\

Description: The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a credit for qualified
  education expenses paid for an eligible student for the first four years of higher
  education. Approximately $0.53B of AOTC overclaims are from the inability to authenticate
  eligibility because the data needed does not exist. This root cause includes errors
  that IRS can only verify via audit since no data exists to support automated compliance
  checks. Approximately $0.90B of AOTC overclaims are from program design limitations.
  Errors caused by program design occur when information needed to confirm payment
  accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed.
