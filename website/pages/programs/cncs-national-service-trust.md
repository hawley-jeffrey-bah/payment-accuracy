  act17_1: "The internal control training will target root causes in both unknown\
    \ and overpayment categories to address adequate record keeping and controls to\
    \ ensure payments are correct and correctly recorded. \n\nRegarding the provision\
    \ of training as a corrective action, AmeriCorps will reestablish the Payment\
    \ Integrity Corrective Action Plan working group to identify corrective actions\
    \ the agency could take to address its improper payment rate. Utilizing improper\
    \ and unknown payments information from AmeriCorps’ annual Payment Integrity Assessment,\
    \ the working group will identify the root cause drivers behind the improper and\
    \ unknown payments. Based on this information, the group will implement additional\
    \ action steps aimed at reducing these areas of non-compliance. The training and\
    \ resources focus on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. \n"
  act17_2: It is essential that grantees have access to training and resources that
    provide information on financial grants management. Having effective and readily
    available resources to guide grantees in program implementation promotes effective
    stewardship of federal funds and reduce non-compliance.  The created resources
    build upon the agency’s currently available tools and focus specifically on areas
    of non-compliance.
  act17_3: "•\tAs part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective\
    \ stewardship of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing\
    \ the agency’s improper payments via an agency-wide corrective action plan. The\
    \ prior establishment of the working group represents a coordinated effort by\
    \ the agency to develop and implement corrective actions aimed at reducing improper\
    \ payments. The agency performs root cause analysis to determine why improper\
    \ payments are occurring at the grantee level. This allows for more targeted actions."

  cyp7_ucp4_1: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
    by grantees and agency-maintained documentation to support the National Service
    Trust disbursement of education awards. There are situations where the grantee
    is unable to provide the required documentation to support the payment or the
    documentation provided is insufficient. In these situations, had the grantee been
    able to provide the missing documentation or adequately documented information
    a determination regarding the payment as either proper or improper could have
    been made.  The specific documentation that was lacking pertained to missing/incomplete
    National Service Criminal History Check information for all improper payments
    within the control of grantees. One payment in with NST where the documentation
    at the agency level was unavailable related to a drug screening, and a determination
    as to whether the payment was proper or improper was not able to be made.
  cyp8: "For disbursements related to grantee-managed members: Grantees are required\
    \ by statute to certify when a member’s service is complete and that they are\
    \ eligible to receive an education award. AmeriCorps must rely upon this certification\
    \ to disburse education awards from the NST. Post payment reviews of full member\
    \ files may result in the discovery of incomplete or non-complaint files that\
    \ may be identified as improper or unknown disbursement. The results of the testing\
    \ revealed situations where the grantee was unable to provide the required documentation\
    \ to support the payment and/or the documentation provided was insufficient. In\
    \ these situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation\
    \ or adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as\
    \ either proper or improper could have been made.  \n\nFor disbursements related\
    \ to agency-managed members: There was one payment in with NST where the documentation\
    \ at the agency level was unavailable, and a determination as to whether the payment\
    \ was proper or improper was not able to be made.\n"

  rap5: As part of its strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship
    of federal resources. This goal includes the objective of reducing the agency’s
    improper payments via five-pronged approach. Via the strategic plan that agency
    is committing resources – human capital, internal controls, and information systems,
    to reduce improper payments.
  rap6: No resources were requested. The agency did not request resources because
    the payments are generally not made at the agency level and are made by individual
    grantees. Corrective actions to target grantees, such as trainings, can be developed
    and performed with resources available.
  rnp3: "The agency is committed to the compliance with PIIA as demonstrated by the\
    \ agency elevating the reduction of improper payments to be a key performance\
    \ indicator in its strategic plan. \n\nThe improper payments reported in ASN and\
    \ FGP are made that the grantee level. The improper payments in ASN and FGP are\
    \ not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary loss to the\
    \ government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s grantees\
    \ are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine if the payment\
    \ was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct control over the\
    \ payments, it has implemented updated trainings to ensure the grantees have the\
    \ requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.\n\nThe NST rate\
    \ is under the statutory threshold and will not report a rate in FY2025. However\
    \ the improper payments identified are almost entirely related to National Service\
    \ Criminal History Checks and retaining adequate documentation by grantee. Corrective\
    \ actions to address these same root causes for ASN will also apply to the NST.\n"
  rnp4: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action plan
    group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group will be
    reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from offices across
    the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action plan development,
    the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary to reduce improper
    payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are made at the grantee
    level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control training to strengthen
    the control environment at the grantee level. Executive managers, programs, and
    other staff contribute to improper payment corrective action planning. Reduction
    in improper payments may be included in performance conversations for those accountable
    for the reduction.
