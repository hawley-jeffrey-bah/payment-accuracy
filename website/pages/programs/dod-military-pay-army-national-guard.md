  act17_1: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) reduced its processing error
    rate from 10.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2023 to 5.1% in FY 2024.  This error rate
    is well below the 10% acceptable risk by the Department. To continue to mitigate
    improper payment error rates, monthly virtual training will continue to be provided
    by ARNG Financial Services to the 50 States, Territories and the District of Columbia.
    These corrective action events trainings have been instrumental in the overall
    reduction of the improper and unknown payment error rates from FY2023 to FY2024.
    These events provide in-depth Military pay training and provide pay technicians
    with the information needed to accurately and efficiently process Military pay.
    Extra emphasis will be placed on the processing of housing allowances and the
    subsequent requirement to properly retain applicable documents. Additionally,
    ARNG in conjunction with the United States Army Reserve, will start a Military
    pay certification program in Q2 of FY2025 to provide in person baseline Military
    pay training to new state pay technicians. This training will be offered quarterly
    to maintain pay proficiency across the 50 States, Territories, and the District
    of Columbia (in addition to the virtual monthly trainings that are already provided).

    to maintain pay proficiency across the 50 States, Territories, and the District
    of Columbia (in addition to the virtual monthly trainings that are already provided).
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The Department is anticipating effective corrective actions continuing
    to be implemented and will be successful in reducing improper and unknown payments.
    The reduction target is less than the estimated projected future year improper
    and unknown payments. Additionally, the Military Pay - Army National Guard program
    is currently underneath the OMB statutory threshold.

  cyp6_1: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) payments annotated as technically
    improper payment errors were caused by housing allowance payments that were made
    without a current DA Form 5960 - Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH) Authorization
    And Dependency Declaration. DA Form 5960s were subsequently produced after the
    entitlement was fully substantiated; however, they were provided after the sampled
    payment was made, thus resulting in a technically improper payment. Additionally,
    in a few samples, while the correct key supporting documentation was provided,
    the signature on the forms were dated after the sampled payment date. In both
    examples, the entitlements that were attributed to the payment were corroborated;
    however, the process followed was not in adherence with Department of Defense
    polices and procedures. When this occurs, the Army takes the appropriate steps
    to correct the Soldier's pay record based on the Army regulations.

  cyp7_ucp3_1: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) payments annotated as
    technically improper payment errors were caused by housing allowance payments
    that were made without a current DA Form 5960 "Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH)
    Authorization And Dependency Declaration." DA Form 5960s were subsequently produced
    after the entitlement was fully substantiated; however, they were provided after
    the sampled payment was made, thus resulting in a technically improper payment.
    DA 5960s, which authorize housing allowance, were a large percentage of the documentation
    that could not be provided. Without a current DA Form 5960, the ARNG cannot determine
    if the payment was improper or proper. Likewise, there were ARNG drill attendance
    rosters that were missing signatures. Similar to the DA 5960s, without the signature
    on the drill form, the ARNG cannot conclude if the payment was proper or improper.
  cyp8: The Military Pay Army National Guard (ARNG) program scenarios are broad and
    complex based upon the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction.
    For example, an unknown sample covering Military pay and allowances, could be
    for multiple reasons. ARNG payments are identified as unknown due to appropriate/applicable
    key supporting documents (KSDs) not readily available to be reviewed. The KSDs
    were not in the designated repositories and subsequently could not be provided
    prior to the review period ending. The ARNG will continue to research the appropriate
    repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve these errors.

    cyp2_1: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) overpayments are within the
      ARNG control to mitigate because the root cause of the overpayments is attributed
      to the state pay offices processing incorrect payment amounts. The ARNG is mitigating
      the risk of continued overpayments by providing virtual comprehensive training
      which is regularly attended by over 200 participants throughout the 50 States,
      U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia. Daily reviews are conducted
      by ARNG Financial Services to prevent these overpayments and in many of these
      cases a retroactive pay action can be processed to correct the service members
      pay record and recoup the overpayments. The vast majority of the ARNG overpayments
      are attributed to Basic Pay and Basic Allowance for Housing entitlements where
      the service member payment was incorrect due to the wrong rank and/or dependent
      status information. The ARNG in conjunction with United States Army Reserve
      (USAR) will start a Military pay certification program in quarter two of FY
      2025 to provide baseline Military pay training to new state pay technicians.
      In FY 2024, ARNG established two memorandums of agreement (MOAs) between the
      US Army Financial Management Command and the Defense Finance and Accounting
      Service to address service member payments processed by Army Military Pay Offices
      (AMPOs). Both MOAs stress the need for proper document retention to substantiate
      pay and the prevention of improper payments. MOAs also clearly outline what
      functions are the responsibility of state pay offices and AMPOs while a ARNG
      service member is on active duty or in a deployment status.

  rap5: 'Internal Controls: The Army National Guard (ARNG) has internal controls in
    place that support the reduction of improper payments in its program to the levels
    the Department has targeted. Moreover, the ARNG pay offices support the end-to-end
    delivery of payroll processing services, received a modified System and Organizational
    Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements
    (SSAE) No. 18 in fiscal year (FY) 2024.


    Human Capital: The ARNG has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments
    in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. As the
    ARNG''s Military Pay program evolves and Department of Defense operations change,
    additional skill sets, and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance
    the program. However, implementing the new strategy for achieving compliance will
    necessitate a considerable increase in payment sampling which will require additional
    human capital working hours to implement.


    Information Systems and Other Infrastructure: The ARNG has the information systems
    and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military
    Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as technology
    advances, the Army and the Department continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency
    of Military Pay through implementation of new integrated pay and personnel processing
    systems. The Army continues to make progress towards fully implementing the Integrated
    Pay and Personnel System – Army (IPPS-A) in the future. Under IPPS-A, improper
    payments will be reduced because entitlements will be directly inputted into the
    Military Pay payroll system by an authorized personnel source thereby eliminating
    all manual processing. Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized
    Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which are the primary
    disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report
    under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2024.'
  rap6: The Department's Military Pay - Army National Guard program did not require
    any Payment Integrity specific recent budget submission to bring the program towards
    achieving compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019. Furthermore,
    the ARNG internal controls and improved processes are cost beneficial, effective
    and will lead to achieving PIIA compliance.
  rnp3: The vast majority of the Military Pay - Army National Guard are due to technical
    improper payments. The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) reduced its processing
    error rate from 10.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2023 to 5.1% in FY 2024.  This error
    rate is well below the 10% acceptable risk by the Department. To continue to mitigate
    improper payment error rates, monthly virtual training will continue to be provided
    by ARNG Financial Services to the 50 States, Territories and the District of Columbia.
    These corrective action events trainings have been instrumental in the overall
    reduction of the improper and unknown payment error rates from FY2023 to FY2024.
    These events provide in-depth Military pay training and provide pay technicians
    with the information needed to accurately and efficiently process Military pay.
    Extra emphasis will be placed on the processing of housing allowances and the
    subsequent requirement to properly retain applicable documents. Additionally,
    ARNG in conjunction with the United States Army Reserve, will start a military
    pay certification program in Q2 of FY2025 to provide in person baseline military
    pay training to new state pay technicians. This training will be offered quarterly
    to maintain pay proficiency across the 50 States, Territories, and the District
    of Columbia (in addition to the virtual monthly trainings that are already provided).
  rnp4: The Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials Steering Committee
    (the Committee) was created in fiscal year 2018 and it institutionalized a forum
    of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required by Appendix
    C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with the Payment
    Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired by the Office
    of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial Officer
    and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy Director,
    Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives from the
    Military Services and defense agencies. The Committee provides oversight to the
    Department of Defense (DoD) Payment Integrity programs and drives action for PIIA
    compliance. More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of improper
    payments testing; the root causes of improper payments and the appropriate actions
    to reduce them; payment recovery activities; and solutions to resolve DoD-wide
    audit findings and recommendations related to improper payments. Additionally,
    it supports audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations,
    and oversees the identification of root cause(s) and the development and implementation
    of corrective actions to address areas of noncompliance.
