  to transit agencies for ongoing operations rather than traditional capital investments.
  The primary root cause of the programâ€™s improper payments is the timing when transit

  COVID relief funds did not align with the prior period accounting adjustments made
  during the testing period such as: reimbursements, accruals, and payroll reversals.
  FTA COVID relief funds are not administered at the Federal level and overpayments
  are outside of FTA control when grant recipients make administrative errors.'
