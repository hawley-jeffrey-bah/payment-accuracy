    cyp2_1: Payments are within agency control because they are either issued directly
      by program staff or through the agency’s contractor, which utilizes a system
      programmed to the specifications of the agency.  Throughout the year, the agency
      conducts audits of both internal and system processes to identify issues.  The
      agency has staff with duties focused on reviewing payment processes to ensure
      compliance with established procedures.

    cyp4_1: Inability to access data/information needed is outside of the agency’s
      control.    The program cannot directly access wage data or dual benefit eligibility
      data housed by other federal agencies. The program continues to explore cost-effective
      methods to mitigate improper payments through training, cross agency communication
      and via annual benefit entitlement questionnaires.
  rap5: The agency has sufficient resources to reduce improper and unknown payments.  There
    is sufficient staff to conduct the necessary audits and reviews as well as the
    necessary infrastructure to update information systems.  Additionally, the agency
    has working arrangements with other federal agencies to provide the information
    needed to issue payments.
  rap6: The budget submission includes a request for funds for human capital.
  rnp3: The program plans to continue to utilize resources provided by Treasury's
    program integrity center.  It will continue to utilize its current audit corrective
    actions with its staff and current medical bill pay contractors.  As needed, the
    program may add additional auditing actions to identify areas that may be of concern
    to stakeholders.  Additionally, the agency will fully cooperate with the OIG's
    auditing program as part of the department's annual financial reporting requirements.  Unit/Office
    level actions will focus on issues that cause IP's/UP's such as compensation rate
    reviews and official pay rate determinations.  Use of Treasury's program will
    help the program's effort to focus on the cause of eligibility issues such as
    offsetting and deceased persons.  Monthly medical bill pay audits ensure the program's
    medical bill contractors are processing payments consisted with program requirements.  The
    course of action planned allows the agency to monitor payments and identify potential
    IP/UP's and their root causes at multiple levels.  Additionally, the use of data
    allows the program to combine individual audit findings into trends to perform
    a root cause analysis.  This multilayered approach can lead to identifying trends,
    which will lead to better training and potentially automated controls to reduce
    future improper payments.  The agency will continue to prioritize payment processing
    and the identification of improper payments.  Each week, the program makes millions
    of dollars of payments, and regular monitoring is key to future root cause analysis.  The
    agency will also look for opportunities that may lead to implementation of systematic
    controls as well as its efforts to address over and under payments after they
    have been identified.
  rnp4: The program has staff responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient
    internal controls toward the reduction of IPs.  The program incorporates internal
    controls into the annual performance standards of agency managers and subordinate
    staff to ensure focus on understating and preventing IPs.  Agency managers are
    held responsible and accountable for meeting proper payment rates.  On a monthly
    basis, managers are required to submit results of IPs identified through audit
    results and supervisor reviews.  The program also conducts quarterly meetings
    with the OIG and the medical bill contractor's staff to discuss the identification
    of potentially fraudulent activity.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: The program remains committed to reducing its IPs by focusing on identifying,
    reporting and implementing new policies to reduce areas of vulnerabilities.  However,
    the agency estimates that the FECA program's IP rate could increase due to its
    capability to identify and assist with the pursuit of fraud adjudication.
