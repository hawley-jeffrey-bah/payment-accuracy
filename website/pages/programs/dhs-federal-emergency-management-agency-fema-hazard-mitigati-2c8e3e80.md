    and rebuild in a way that reduces, or mitigates, future disaster losses in their
    communities. When requested by an authorized representative, this grant funding
    is available after a presidentially declared disaster.


    For the testing conducted in 2022, FEMA’s assessment was focused on the associated
    FY 2020 disaster supplemental funding disbursements. As this is the first year
    in testing, the program has not yet been considered baselined by DHS and will
    be tracked for Phase 2 testing to continue for reporting in FY 2023 (over FY 2021
    disbursements).'
  rap5: DHS has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and
    information system and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and unknown
    payments to the tolerable rate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
    - Hazard Mitigation Grant Program - Disaster Supplemental Funds program.
  rap6: N/A - DHS did not request additional resources in the most recent budget submission
    of the agency.
  rnp3: FEMA engages with Grantees and process owners in monthly remediation meetings
    to assure appropriate accountable officials are actively taking actions to reduce
    improper payments and identify and categorize unknown improper transactions as
    either proper or improper. If unknown transactions are deemed proper no further
    action is taken. If a transaction is deemed administratively improper FEMA requires
    a corrective action be put in place in order resolve issues surrounding procedures
    policies and trainings. If a transaction is deemed technically improper then the
    transaction is submitted through our debt collection process including Notice
    of Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset if applicable. In FY 23, FEMA will
    conduct periodic status meetings to make sure all parties are tracking and resolving
    improper payments through its remediation process.

    Description_Action_Taken: "The National Emergency Management Information System\
      \ (NEMIS) is a database system used to track disaster data for FEMA and recipient\
      \ emergency management offices. NEMIS supports emergency management at a disaster\
      \ site and enables FEMA to integrate mitigation and planning operations with\
      \ FEMA programs and disaster assistance. NEMIS enables data to be coordinated\
      \ throughout a disaster, from monitoring an incident to providing assistance\
      \ to communities affected by a disaster. \n\nThe NEMIS HMGP System is the Mitigation\
      \ module of NEMIS. This module provides a way to administer HMGP information\
      \ and grant applications. It interacts with some of the other NEMIS modules\
      \ such as Declaration, Preliminary Damage Assessment, and Emergency Support.\
      \ The NEMIS HMGP System can track project applications through workflow processes\
      \ and work packets. For each task in a workflow process, the system generates\
      \ a work packet. Users access the work packet to accomplish the steps in the\
      \ process. The NEMIS HMGP System executes work packets and workflow to assist\
      \ in automating the Eligibility Determination, Project Review and Approval,\
      \ Application Review and Approval, etc."

    Description_Action_Taken: Effective March 2023, FEMA released the updated Hazard
      Mitigation Assistance Program and Policy Guide (HMA Guide).  The purpose of
      the HMA Guide is to outline the policy and procedural requirements of FEMA’s
      mitigation grant programs over the lifecycle of a project or activity. The 2023
      HMA Guide update incorporates existing policies and guidance materials issued
      since 2015, simplifies and clarifies guidance, and incorporates strategic mitigation
      priorities.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: FEMA will continue to provide regular training opportunities
      for regional partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.
      Training is specifically tailored to each audience and will continue to range
      from webinar recordings to on-demand workshops. Training offered through the
      Emergency Management Institute will also continue to offer self-paced courses,
      with a certificate of completion provided at the end. By continuing to train
      relevant parties and stakeholders, FEMA can continue to sustain and enhance
      program performance going forward, including the assurance that sufficient documentation
      is readily available.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)
      requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities they administer
      and identify those determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments,
      estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates
      to Congress. In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
      A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement, federal agencies
      are required to assess improper payments and report annually on their efforts.
      As a result of the testing procedures performed on the statistical sample of
      payments, FEMA identified minimal errors in the HMGP – Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program selected samples. Based on the extrapolated results, the program
      is not susceptible to significant improper payments as the estimated results
      are below both the 1.5% error rate and the $10M error amount thresholds established
      by OMB.


      In addition, FEMA performed an assessment of internal control over financial
      reporting including performing tests of operating effectiveness, for the FY
      2023 performance period. These internal control assessments included a review
      over Grants Management with no significant or material internal control issues
      arising related to HMGP.'

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Trainings are available and are designed to help FEMA
      regional partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments create
      effective hazard mitigation plans that meet FEMA’s requirements and reduce risk
      in their communities. Training is specifically tailored to each audience. Additionally,
      several advanced trainings and technical assistance related to pertinent areas
      in hazard mitigation assistance are available. These range from webinar recordings
      to on-demand workshops.


      FEMA continues to provide both classroom and online independent study courses
      for staff, as well as state, local, territorial, and tribal government employees
      to register for training through the Emergency Management Institute or through
      their State Mitigation Officer.


      The Emergency Management Institute serves as the national focal point for the
      development and delivery of emergency management training to enhance the capabilities
      of federal, state, local, tribal and territorial government officials, volunteer
      organizations and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters.
      Training classes through the Emergency Management Institute offer self-paced
      courses, with a certificate of completion provided at the end.'

    Disaster Supplemental Funds program''s FY 2021 disbursement activity, the following
    list is an example of documentation that was not provided or was not sufficient
    to finalize the assessment determination for a total of three (3) samples:

    • Documentation to support that this payment is the only payment made to the specified
    vendor, for the specified work, within the specified time period

    • Authorized Federal and Non-Federal cost shares were applied for eligible activities
    based on specific guidance

    • All funds supported allowable costs per the applicable FEMA HMGP guidance'
  cyp8: 'Payments are considered unknown payments when the associated recipient, and
    if applicable sub-recipient(s), fail to provide adequate supporting documentation
    in accordance with the grant agreement, such as amendments or price tables, or
    to support the disbursement drawdown amount. Without adequate supporting documentation,
    FEMA is unable to discern whether the payments were proper or improper as the
    disbursement could not reconciled to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  In
    order to assert to the appropriateness of the payment, FEMA generally requests
    the following information from the recipients:

    • FEMA State Agreement or Tribal Agreement

    • Completed Application (digital or otherwise) to include: the Application for
    Federal Assistance, Eligibility and Completeness Review Checklist for Project
    Sub-applications, and Any additional Required Attachments.

    • Supporting Payment Documentation


    FEMA conducted testing over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the Hazard Mitigation
    Grant Program - Disaster Supplemental Funds program between October 2022 and September
    2023. During that review period, FEMA was unable to obtain sufficient documentation
    for three (3) transaction samples, related to Georgia and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
    out of the total sample size of 129 transactions. This inhibited FEMA''s ability
    to fully ascertain whether the payment for these specific transactions was proper
    or improper. These sample results were then extrapolated to the entire program
    population in accordance with the DHS statistical methodology.'
