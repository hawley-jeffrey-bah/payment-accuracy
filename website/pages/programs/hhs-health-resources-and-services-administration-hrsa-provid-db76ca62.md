  pro1: The COVID-19 UIP was determined to be risk-susceptible in FY 2021. Payments
    for testing and treatment claims began in May 2020, and vaccine administration
    began in Feb 2021. HHS developed, submitted, and began to implement the improper
    payment estimation methodology. However, due to the timing constraints of testing
    claims, HHS was unable to complete the statistical sampling methodology and subsequent
    extrapolation procedures to identify and report improper and unknown improper
    payments in FY 2022. HHS expects to complete testing and report an improper payment
    estimate for this program in FY 2023.

  act17_1: HHS conducts reviews of UIP claims reimbursement recipient to ensure compliance
    with applicable legislation and the UIP Terms and Conditions and resolves single
    and commercial audit findings associated with the UIP and recovered disallowed
    costs.
  act17_2: HHS is working with the UIP contractor to address any data needs and brainstormed
    methods to address these needs, including any data integrity or quality issues.
    HHS is working with IT and Security partners and the UIP contractor to bring UIP
    data in-house securely to use for various requests, audits, and assessments.
  act17_3: HHS continued to work with the UIP contractor to address any data needs
    and brainstormed methods to address these needs, including any data integrity
    or quality issues. HHS is working with IT and security partners and the UIP contractor
    to bring UIP data in-house in a secure manner to use forvarious requests, audits,
    and assessments and reprocessed claims incorrectly paid due to government error,
    such as internal adjudication or payment errors. Prior to the passage of the FRA,
    HHS had planned to reprocess claims that were underpaid as a result of the incorrect
    fee schedule used to pay certain services.

  cyp7_ucp3_1: One of HRSA's test is to determine the eligibility of recipient of
    claims by ensuring that appropriate and sufficient documents were reviewed. When
    HRSA is unable to receive appropriate documentation to determine the eligibility
    of health-care providers, any payment to such providers is considered as unknown
    payments. HRSA determined that the Tax Identification Number (TINs) of four health-care
    providers that received claims did not match the Tax Identification Number (TINs)
    of the health-care providers that provided services and submitted claims for the
    some claimed that were paid.
  cyp8: A payment is considered “Unknown” when an agency is unable to obtain the documentation
    needed for a reviewer to determine whether the payment was made to the right recipient
    and/or for the right amount. Concerning FY24 UIP testing, HRSA had some “unknown
    payments” because health-care providers’ eligibility could not be verified due
    to the Tax Identification Number (TINs) per the sample data not matching the TINs
    in the supporting documentation, and HRSA could not determine if the payments
    were made the right health-care providers.

    cyp2_1: The overpayments within the agency control were due to pricing errors
      (incorrect claims reimbursements due to pricing errors associated with Healthcare
      Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) rates) and incorrect calculation (incorrect
      claims reimbursements due to the use of prior published rates when calculating
      payments or recalculated amounts not reconciling). There is inadequate documentation
      to support some claim payments.

  pro1: The UIP program rounded up in FY 2023. Due to a lack of sufficient funds,
    the UIP stopped accepting testing and treatment claims on March 22, 2022, at11:59
    p.m. ET and on April 5, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. ET for vaccine administration claims.
    On June 3, 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 was enacted. With
    the passage of FRA and the related rescission of program funds, no additional
    claims will be reimbursed under the UIP. Therefore, FY2024will be the last year
    for UIP testing.
  rap5: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program.
  rap6: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program.
  rnp3: Coupled with the historical records, HHS continues to work with the UIP contractor
    to address any data needs and brainstorm methods to address these needs, including
    any data integrity or quality issues. HHS is working with our IT and security
    partners as well as the UIP contractor, to bring UIP data in-house in a secure
    manner, which can then be used for various requests, audits, and assessments and
    has reprocessed claims that were incorrectly paid due to government error, such
    as internal adjudication or payment errors. Prior to the passage of the FRA, HHS
    had planned to reprocess claims that were underpaid as a result of the incorrect
    fee schedule used to pay certain services.
  rnp4: HHS has performance management programs to develop goals and strategies for
    staff through which success can be measured and rewarded. Performance Management
    Appraisal Program (PMAP) is one component of the ongoing process of performance
    management. It sets goals for performance and shares those goals while establishing
    the performance plan and required mid-year and annual review discussions. PMAP
    includes two critical elements that track back to the HHS and HRSA strategic plan
    and align with the goals and initiatives of senior leadership. Administrative
    Requirements is one category of critical element that are required of all agency
    staff as part of their job duties and responsibilities to identify and address
    weaknesses to ensure recovery of improper payments and to reduce the number of
    improper payments made by the Department.
