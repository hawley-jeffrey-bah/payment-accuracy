  rnp3: VA continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments agency-wide as evidenced by
    its third consecutive and largest year of reductions. Specifically, from FY20
    to FY21, the VA Community Care program decreased its error rate from 78.51 percent
    to 16.06 percent (62.45% reduction) and improper payments from $7,476.55 million
    to $2,274.69 million ($5,201.86 million reduction). Due to VA Community Care reporting
    over $100 million of overpayments/monetary loss in FY2020, the program was required
    by Office of Management and Budget to report quarterly on activities and accomplishments
    that reduce monetary loss. Those activities and accomplishments can be found at
    PaymentAccuracy.gov. VA Community Care has remained committed to actions that
    reduce monetary loss and continues to tailor corrective actions to reduce improper
    payments.

  cyp20_2: The VA Community Care reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper payment estimates.  Reduction
    targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing VA has
    learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper payments
    legislation is that it can take three years from the point an error cause is isolated
    during testing to develop a corrective action, implement it, and then wait for
    payments to be made that can then be tested the following year since VA tests
    and reports improper payments one year in arrears.
  cyp26: '311.67'
  cyp6: '311.13'
  cyp6_1: While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
    amount, the payment failed to meet all regulatory and/or statutory requirements.
    Specifically, the authorization exceeded the $10,000 threshold in the VA Acquisition
    Regulations 813.307. This resulted in technically improper payments.
  cyp8: VA had lacking or insufficient documentation related to the payment that was
    required to validate whether a payment was proper or not. The agency was missing
    documentation which contained key information that would have enabled the agency's
    ability to discern whether the payment was proper or improper. The missing documentation
    contained information such as the final pricing methodology related to the correct
    payment amount.

      ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving efficiencies in
      the payment processes and accuracy of pricing results. Additionally, system
      enhancements will improve functionality of the payment processing systems and
      allow for automation of the authorization review. These improvements will decrease
      human error and increase payment accuracy.

  pro1: The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its fourth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY
    2022. Specifically, from FY 2021 to FY 2022, the VA Community Care program decreased
    its improper and unknown error rate from 16.06% to 7.84% (8.22% reduction) and
    improper and unknown payments from $2,274.69 million to $1,363.13 million ($911.55
    million reduction).
  rap5: VA has not yet determined the tolerable rate. VA is working to determine all
    requirements for establishing a tolerable rate per Office of Management and Budget
    guidance before attempting to establish tolerable rates.  At this time, VA is
    not aware of additional program needs.
  rap6: VA is still working to determine all requirements for establishing a tolerable
    rate per OMB guidance before attempting to establish a tolerable rate.  At this
    time, VA is not aware of additional program needs.
  rnp3: 'VA performed an effectiveness review in FY 2022 of the actions implemented
    in FY 2021. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective
    actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
    and prioritized within the agency. The results for the VA Community Care program
    indicated that of the nine actions assessed, six were closed and determined to
    be effective in mitigating the root cause, two were closed and determined to be
    ineffective in mitigating the root cause, and one was open and determined to be
    correctly designed to mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be made,
    VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies
    to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper payment
    amount from $2,018.02 million in FY 2020 to $1,381.62 million in FY 2021, or a
    32% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program were not met,
    associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
    reduction in the improper payment amount from $5,458.54 million in FY 2020 to
    $411.72 million in FY 2021, or a 92% reduction. There were no errors or associated
    corrective actions or mitigation strategies tied to unable to determine whether
    proper or improper in FY 2020.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2023 of the corrective action plans
    implemented in FY 2022 due to the time needed to implement actions as well as
    to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported in FY 2023.'

      requirements are accurately enforced in the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System. VA also improved pre-payment checks in the authorization system to improve
      claims processing accuracy. In addition, VA researched why Veteran's other health
      insurance information was not present in the payment system to correct and prevent
      future deficiencies. VA also continued with the post-implementation of the MISSION
      Act. This includes moving previous non-contract claims into compliant purchasing
      vehicles such as agreements and contracts. Finally, VA documented the decision
      of whether or not to apply the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services End-Stage
      Renal Disease network reduction to VA dialysis claims.

  cyp7_ucp4_1: VA is required to validate the appropriate reimbursement rate per the
    other health insurance information for non-contract related payments. However,
    the agency currently does not have the documentation necessary to determine if
    the payment is proper or not. Specifically, VA is not able to determine the correct
    rate without the required explanation of benefits. When the explanation of benefits
    is not available, the claim should be returned to the provider. The missing documentation
    needed will assist VA in determining whether or not the reimbursement amount per
    VA regulation is correct. For this reason, we are unable to conclude whether the
    payment is proper or improper at time of payment without that documentation.
  cyp8: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
    documentation to validate pricing. Specifically, VA was unable to determine the
    appropriate pricing due to the lack of other health insurance documentation. Without
    documentation supporting the other health insurance information for specific non-contract
    related payments, the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is
    proper or improper.

    cyp2: '954.17'
    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to determine that a valid agreement
      was in place and/or that the provider is eligible per the contract or agreement
      covering the billed dates of services prior to issuing payment. VA is also required
      to validate that payment was made in accordance with the contract rate, billed
      services did not exceed the authorized care and were eligible per regulatory
      or contractual requirements prior to issuing payment, and that payment is made
      in the appropriate amount per regulation. For contract related instances, the
      Community Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA
      is invoiced in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving controls in the payment processes, implementing system enhancements
      to include a prepayment check, and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorization review, decreasing
      human error. These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY
    2023. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the VA Community Care program decreased
    its improper and unknown error rate from 7.84% to 4.92% (2.92% reduction) and
    improper and unknown payments from $1,363.13 million to $992.38 million ($370.75
    million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these
    actions on its FY 2024 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
    reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
    and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
    and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding to implement
    improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information systems
    and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and procurement
    systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will establish
    a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal controls
    to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include ensuring contract language is
      clear and clarify any inconsistent payment methodology instances with third-party
      administrators regarding payment discrepancies. Additionally, VA will engage
      in a contract modification to further elaborate on standard episode of care
      claims processing. In addition, VA will ensure timely filing criteria is clear
      and proper monitoring is in place. Change process was the best mitigation strategy

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q3
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included updating the claims processing
      system to identify and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should be
      processed by a third-party administrator to deny out of network facility provider
      claims for emergent episodes of care. Additionally, VA transitioned National
      Dialysis Contract claims from a legacy system to an automated claims processing
      system to ensure claims are paid at the correct rates. In addition, VA updated
      system logic in the claims processing system to suspend or deny dental claims
      when provider criteria does not reconcile to the Veterans Care Agreement. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error.

  act17_1: VA has identified root causes for improper and unknown payments and developed
    effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. The cause of FY 2024 improper
    payments were attributed to failure to access data/information. The majority of
    overpayments occurred because the claim was not received within the required timeframe.
    Automation was the best mitigation strategy because overpayments resulted from
    manual processes and human error. Change process was the best mitigation strategy
    in order to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing
    payment processes. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate the
    importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures. Audit was the best
    mitigation strategy to help identify overpayments and perform a follow-up process.
  act17_2: VA reduced the error rate in this program from 4.92% in FY 2023 to 1.90%
    in FY 2024, resulting in a reduction of $575.75 million, by implementing effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies. VA's process for development of
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies ensures the severity of the error
    is considered and the action is adequate. VA's corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies have been evaluated by the Office of Inspector General during their
    FY 2024 annual audit and determined reasonable with no recommendations for improvement.
    The overpayments were attributed to VA's failure to access data/information. Actions
    taken regarding automation included updating the claims processing system to identify
    and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should be processed by a third-party
    administrator to deny out of network facility provider claims for emergent episodes
    of care. Additionally, VA transitioned National Dialysis Contract claims from
    a legacy system to an automated claims processing system to ensure claims are
    paid at the correct rates. In addition, VA updated system logic in the claims
    processing system to suspend or deny dental claims when provider criteria does
    not reconcile to the Veterans Care Agreement. Actions taken regarding training
    included VA providing training on claims processing requirements when required
    other health insurance documentation was missing. Actions taken regarding change
    process included clarified payment methodology with VA and third-party administrators
    to bill at the correct allowable rates. Additionally, for non-network payments,
    VA implemented system checks to suspend institutional inpatient and ambulance
    claims for manual review prior to payment. In addition, VA instructed third-party
    administrators to follow standard billing practices as defined in the contract
    and communicated to claims processing agents to not process claims when timely
    filing requirements were not met. Actions planned regarding audit include conducting
    post-payment reviews and establishing bills of collection for claims that were
    overpaid. Actions planned regarding change process include ensuring contract language
    is clear and clarify any inconsistent payment methodology instances with third-party
    administrators regarding payment discrepancies. Additionally, VA will engage in
    a contract modification to further elaborate on standard episode of care claims
    processing. Finally, VA will ensure timely filing criteria is clear and proper
    monitoring is in place.
  act17_3: VA updates corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and
    no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions taken and
    planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper
    and unknown payments. VA monitors progress and results of implementation on a
    quarterly basis. Additionally, an effectiveness review is performed annually to
    measure if an action planned has reduced or is properly designed to reduce improper
    and unknown payments for a specific root cause based on a set benchmark. VA identifies
    areas for improvement and conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's
    mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.
    The decrease in the improper payment and unknown payment rate from 4.92% in FY
    2023 to 1.90% in FY 2024, and the $575.75 million reduction in improper and unknown
    payments supports the effective implementation and prioritization of action within
    the agency. Furthermore, the annual effectiveness review process allows VA to
    create or update actions as necessary to ensure continued progress in the remediation
    of improper and unknown payments.
  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: The VA Community Care reduction target is equal to the estimated future
    improper payment and unknown payment rate. VA establishes reduction targets by
    setting them lower than the current year improper and unknown payment estimates.
    Reduction targets are a balance between being aggressive and realistic. One thing
    VA has learned from the many years it has been working to comply with improper
    payments legislation is that it can take three to five years from the point an
    error cause is isolated during testing to develop a corrective action, implement
    it, and then wait for payments to be made that can then be tested the following
    year since VA tests and reports improper payments one year in arrears.

    cyp2_1: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to determine that the provider
      is eligible per the contract or agreement covering the billed dates of services
      prior to issuing payment. VA is also required to validate that payment was made
      in accordance with the contract rate and in the appropriate amount per regulation,
      billed services did not exceed the authorized care, and claims were received
      within the required timeframes. For contract related instances, the Community
      Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA is invoiced
      in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines, and VA is responsible
      to ensure the contract terms are met. The agency has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes and
      simplifying contract pricing. These improvements will allow for more accurate
      payment validation.

  pro1: The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of reductions and is expected
    to maintain compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 for
    FY 2024. Specifically, from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the VA Community Care program
    decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 4.92% to 1.90% (3.02% reduction)
    and improper and unknown payments from $992.38 million to $416.63 million ($575.75
    million reduction). Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions and
    mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of these
    actions on its FY 2025 improper and unknown payment rate.
  rap5: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, the Government Accountability
    Office acknowledged VA’s substantial reduction in improper and unknown payments
    using effective mitigation strategies and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER
    PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues
    to prioritize implementing appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    and has adequate funding to implement improvements planned to internal controls,
    human capital, information systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s
    payment processing and procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown
    payments. VA is still actively reducing improper and unknown payments within its
    existing budget authority. VA considers the reduction of improper and unknown
    payments a critical part of its financial stewardship efforts.'
  rap6: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore, VA has
    not requested additional resources to establish and maintain payment integrity.
  rnp3: 'The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
    payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of reductions. Specifically,
    from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the VA Community Care program decreased its improper
    and unknown error rate from 4.92% to 1.90% (3.02% reduction) and improper and
    unknown payments from $992.38 million to $416.63 million ($575.75 million reduction).
    In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and
    implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness
    of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
    implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the VA Community
    Care program indicated that of the eight actions assessed, seven were effective
    and one was designed effectively. If improvements could be made, VA conducted
    a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure
    they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


    For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions
    or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper payment amount
    from $959.53 million in FY 2023 to $416.63 million in FY 2024, or a 57% reduction.
    For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated
    corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a 100% reduction in
    the unknown payment amount from $32.85 million in FY 2023 to $0 in FY 2024.


    VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action plans
    developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and implement
    actions and to impact the payment process. Results of this review will be reported
    in FY 2025.'
  rnp4: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
    General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for
    a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers and program
    personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
    This will include various mitigation strategies such as change process and audit.
    These actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024 payment integrity
    testing. VA’s executive managers to include the Executive Director of Integrated
    Veteran Care and Integrated External Networks and program personnel will be held
    accountable through annual performance criteria contained within their performance
    plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties.
    Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper
    and unknown payments through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments
    if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper
    and unknown payments. State and local governments are not involved in the execution
    of this program.
  rtp1: Unknown because the agency has not yet determined the tolerable rate for this
    program
  rtp4_2: VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
    a tolerable rate not yet being met. VA continues to identify and implement appropriate
    corrective actions and mitigation strategies to further reduce the improper and
    unknown payment rate. VA has determined these corrective actions and mitigation
    strategies do not impede the mission and can be implemented cost-effectively within
    existing budget authority.

Description: The VA Community Care program allows VA to authorize Veteran care at
  non-VA health care facilities when the needed services are not available through
  the VA, or when the Veteran is unable to travel to a VA facility. The program was
  used to provide timely and specialized care to approximately three million Veterans
  in FY 2024. The program reported $416.63 million in projected monetary loss in FY
  2024, most of which resulted from paying for claims not received within the required
  timeframe, services lacking proper authorization, or amounts that did not align
  with the contracted rate. There are no known financial, contractor or provider status
  related barriers prohibiting improving the prevention of improper payments.
