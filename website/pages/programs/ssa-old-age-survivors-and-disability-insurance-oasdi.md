  rap6: The fiscal year 2023 President’s Budget included resources for internal controls
    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested funding for program
    integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use, such as our medical Continuing

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we released several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve the system.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The
      CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process,
      increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted
      product is comprised of four separate workstreams, across several component
      business and systems sponsors.  In addition to work CDRs, the Product aims to
      modernize the medical CDR process with the addition of online service options
      and reduce paper case processing by automating current Electronic Disability
      Collect System exclusions.  In February 2023, CDR product released the i454
      which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or
      a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician''s
      process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2024, we plan to release Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the Electronic
      Disability Collect System (EDCS) that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.
      and plan to make the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We
      are currently beginning the development of a  modernized version of eWork which
      will eventually be integrated into the existing EDCS application and will make
      EDCS available for field office technicians.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021,
      we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs
      that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation
      (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with
      processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, six
      BOTs have been created and placed into production.  Use of the BOTs reduces
      keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In
      FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and
      implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input
      of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term
      investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes
      and eliminate manual actions.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to the all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

      Continuing Disability Reviews more efficiently by identifying earnings earlier,
      identifying cases that have earnings above substantial gainful activity (SGA)
      and are still receiving benefits, and prioritizing cases that are most likely
      to end in an SGA cessation.  This helps prevent beneficiaries from building
      overpayment debts.

      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent beneficiaries, and
      representative payees to report wages and view, print, or save a receipt.  DI
      self-reporters and their representative payees can report wages that occurred
      within a two-year timeframe from the reporting date.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos depicting three reporting options:  my Social Security, SSA
      Mobile Wage Reporting, and SSI Telephone Wage Reporting.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information

      keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In
      FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and
      implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input
      of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term
      investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes
      and eliminate manual actions.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to the all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

      Insurance beneficiaries about their reporting responsibilities.  Section 826
      of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required the Commissioner to establish
      and implement a system permitting DI beneficiaries to report their earnings
      electronically.  Our myWageReport (myWR) online application, allows DI beneficiaries,
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent beneficiaries, and
      representative payees to report wages and view, print, or save a receipt.  DI
      self-reporters and their representative payees can report wages that occurred
      within a two-year timeframe from the reporting date.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos depicting three reporting options:  my Social Security, SSA
      Mobile Wage Reporting, and SSI Telephone Wage Reporting.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplifying our notices.  Although we made efforts
      to simplify notices, some of our notices and communications can be complex,
      lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from
      the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain
      information.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the
      quality and understandability of our communications.  We will inform and remind
      beneficiaries about reporting responsibilities.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
      and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a
      comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of
      WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross agency work group to review
      all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive
      list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the
      root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy,
      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  Since FY 2017, there has been
      a significant reduction in improper payments related to WEP and GPO.  In July
      2023, the WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  However,
      we continue to assert that the complexity of our program makes it extremely
      challenging to isolate the effects of a particular corrective action.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access data or information needed, we look for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for higher Supplemental
      Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  From March to August
      2020, SSI applications decreased by 30 percent when compared to prior years.  We
      analyzed a range of beneficiary characteristics to determine if any groups were
      disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We identified a population
      of 1.4 million individuals who are currently receiving OASDI benefits that are
      less than the SSI federal benefit rate.  Based on these findings, we mailed
      approximately 200,000 letters to beneficiaries potentially eligible for SSI,
      with a focus on the aged and limited English proficiency population.  The preliminary
      mailing occurred December 2020–March 2021.  We released the remaining 1.2 million
      mailers on a staggered schedule from June 2021–November 2021, pausing to avoid
      increased call months, and resumed the issuance of mailers from April 2022–December
      2022.  Beneficiaries who had an email registered with the agency also received
      an email.  In October 2022, we mailed out more than 19,000 notices to beneficiaries
      receiving spousal benefits who may have sufficient earnings to be eligible for
      higher retirement benefits based on their own earnings.  In December 2022, we
      issued a reminder to field office and payment center technicians on proper development
      of the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset.  In April
      2023, we mailed out almost 38,000 notices to surviving spouses who are potentially
      eligible for higher retirement benefits on their own records.  We issued a reminder
      on instructions regarding the potential entitlement workload concerning disabled
      beneficiaries who are potentially eligible for widow(er)’s insurance benefits
      or disabled widow’s benefits.

      is a tool that identifies Disability Insurance beneficiaries whose earnings
      put them at risk for being overpaid.  We created the WorkSmart project to reduce
      and prevent Improper Payments and complete work Continuing Disability Reviews
      more efficiently by identifying earnings earlier, identifying cases that have
      earnings above substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are still receiving benefits,
      and prioritizing cases that are most likely to end in an SGA cessation.  This
      helps prevent beneficiaries from building overpayment debts.'

    cyp2_1: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments within the agency’s
      control are caused by our failure to access data or information needed.  These
      overpayments occur when we have access to the data or information we need to
      accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information
      provided to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The leading
      cause of the overpayment was our failure to timely update records with reported
      changes or take appropriate action.  An incorrect action could be due to a mathematical
      error, typographical error, incorrect policy interpretation, or delay in input.  To
      prevent these overpayments from occurring, we provide training and reminders
      for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy

    cyp4_1: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments outside the
      agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to calculate
      a payment because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide the
      requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute
      the accurate benefit amount.  It occurs because of beneficiaries’ or representative
      payees’ failure to report changes.  For this reporting period, the leading cause
      of overpayments outside the agency’s control was the failure to report changes
      in marital status timely (i.e. marriage, divorce, or remarriage).
  pro1: "The annual sample in our Stewardship Reviews is sufficient to provide statistically\
    \ reliable data on the overall payment accuracy.  However, the annual sample does\
    \ not provide statistically reliable information about individual deficiencies\
    \ in a given year; therefore, we use an average of a 5-year period.  The data\
    \ call is based on fiscal year 2022 (single year) stewardship findings.  Corrective\
    \ actions are based on stewardship findings and marital status/relationship has\
    \ not been the leading cause of Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments.\
    \ \n\nWe are responsible for issuing over $1 trillion in benefit payments annually;\
    \ even the slightest error in the overall payment process can result in billions\
    \ of dollars in improper payments.  It is important to note that we maintain a\
    \ high payment accuracy rate.  As good stewards of our programs and as required\
    \ by law, we continue our quality reviews, cost-effective program integrity work,\
    \ and payment accuracy efforts to ensure individuals receive the benefits for\
    \ which they are eligible.  We are examining our internal policies and procedures\
    \ for opportunities to improve so that we can maintain a high payment accuracy\
    \ rate.  The Acting Commissioner recently established a team to review our overpayment\
    \ policies and procedures to further improve how we serve our customers."
  rap5: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that has
    always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
    existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
    assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating
    effectively.


    As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
    management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
    Act.


    We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
    membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
    clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


    Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on
    having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our employees
    who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and
    other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is critical to maintain
    a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship work.


    Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
    to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
    investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
    digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and mobile
    accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital services
    that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers to service
    to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and employees.  We
    are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service while reducing
    manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient funding is necessary
    to continue to modernize our IT.


    Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
    information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
    to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
    controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
    and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
    a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous
    improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive
    Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and
    Budget (OMB) Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
    Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes
    to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents
    Act.


    Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
    network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
    cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
    partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
    flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.'
  rap6: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget included resources for internal controls
    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested funding for program
    integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use, such as our medical Continuing
    Disability Reviews, work Continuing Disability Reviews, and the Cooperative Disability
    Investigations program, save billions of program dollars with a proportionally
    small investment of administrative resources.
  rnp3: 'We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure
    stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor
    the status of corrective actions through monthly meetings and quarterly senior
    executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive
    approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target
    the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to
    prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The
    purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that
    will have the most significant impact to the detection and prevention of improper
    payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments,
    we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally
    responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.


    In fiscal year 2023, we completed evaluations on three of the Improper Payments
    Alignment Strategies.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore cost-effective
    corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we continue to note
    that the complexity of our Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability program makes it
    extremely difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular
    corrective action.'

    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by inability to\
      \ access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners\
      \ from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business\
      \ sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community\
      \ of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to\
      \ engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming\
      \ data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist\
      \ in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.\
      \  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper\
      \ payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage\
      \ State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September\
      \ 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the\
      \ purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts\
      \ with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage\
      \ more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure\
      \ to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.\
      \  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.\
      \  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians\
      \ for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data. \
      \ Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined\
      \ death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR). \
      \ As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process. \
      \ We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving\
      \ the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records\
      \ in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued\
      \ a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports\
      \ of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death\
      \ information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association\
      \ for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of\
      \ historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity,\
      \ and completeness of our death data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused\
      \ by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment\
      \ Compensation Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’\
      \ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL),\
      \ provides coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of\
      \ FECA benefits can offset Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)\
      \ benefits.  We have agreed with DOL to move forward with our request for DOL\
      \ FECA data.  We are working to finalize the agreement for DOL to provide FECA\
      \ payment data to assist us in our offset requirements.  In December 2023, the\
      \ agency established an eCOMP system Memorandum of Understanding with DOL to\
      \ obtain FECA benefits to allow the agency to offset OASDI benefits and prevent\
      \ or reduce overpayments.  Technicians can complete an ad hoc query in eCOMP\
      \ to obtain FECA data, the FECA payment status, dates, amounts and it is immediately\
      \ available to the technician via the eCOMP portal.  In April 2024, we provided\
      \ reminders on how to process initial claims with workers compensation lump-sum\
      \ settlement allegations.  We expect the exchange to be completed in FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or\
      \ information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and\
      \ to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage\
      \ reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial\
      \ payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget\
      \ Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In\
      \ February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing\
      \ the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers\
      \ to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves\
      \ service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.\
      \  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which\
      \ is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we\
      \ completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue\
      \ diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from\
      \ PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review\
      \ and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased\
      \ approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements\
      \ and allow us to respond to public concerns from the NPRM public comment period."

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we issue reminders and policy clarifications to
      employees, as needed.  In November 2023, we issued a reminder to technicians
      about the importance of inputting Family Max when manually calculating benefits.  In
      March 2024, we updated policy providing detailed information to technicians
      regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely,
      when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  We will
      continue to issue reminders and policy clarifications to employees, as needed.

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
      and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a
      comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of
      WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross agency work group to review
      all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive
      list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the
      root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy,
      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the
      WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  In FY 2023,
      there was an increase in improper payments related to WEP, but overall, since
      FY 2017, there has been a significant reduction in improper payments related
      to WEP and GPO.  In March 2024, we provided detailed information to technicians
      regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely,
      when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  In FY 2024,
      we developed a new policy to address multiple non-covered pensions distributed
      or terminated at different periods of time.  This will provide a consistent
      national policy.  We plan to publish the policy in FY 2025.

    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by inability to\
      \ access the data or information needed, we inform Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability\
      \ Insurance beneficiaries about their reporting responsibilities.  To determine\
      \ whether a beneficiary meets the Marital Status eligibility criteria, we must\
      \ evaluate a beneficiary’s state of being unmarried, married, divorced, or widowed.\
      \  Entitlement to some categories of benefits is impacted by the beneficiary’s\
      \ marital status, so we rely on beneficiaries to report changes in their marital\
      \ status.  Section 826 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required the Commissioner\
      \ to establish and implement a system permitting Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries\
      \ to report their earnings electronically.  Our myWageReport (myWR) online application,\
      \ allows DI beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent\
      \ beneficiaries, and representative payees to report wages and view, print,\
      \ or save a receipt.  DI self-reporters and their representative payees can\
      \ report wages that occurred within a two-year timeframe from the reporting\
      \ date.  We promote use of our online wage reporting application, myWR, on social\
      \ media with training videos.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we released\
      \ social media posts on Facebook and X sharing a link to our YouTube video to\
      \ help beneficiaries learn why it is important to report wages and the automated\
      \ electronic options for wage reporting.  In February 2024, we issued reminders\
      \ on Social Security TV in field office reception areas to report relationship\
      \ changes as it may affect their Social Security payments.  In August 2024,\
      \ we published a blog about the importance of reporting changes.  The article\
      \ provided examples of life changes that need to be reported to Social Security\
      \ to avoid overpayments.  In July and August 2024, we used our social media\
      \ channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly\
      \ reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure\
      \ accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  We plan to use our social media\
      \ channels to post reminders for our beneficiaries about the importance of promptly\
      \ reporting changes to their income, resources, and living arrangements to ensure\
      \ accurate benefits and avoid overpayments.  These posts also inform beneficiaries\
      \ how we are required by law to adjust benefits or recover debts when people\
      \ receive payments they are not entitled to.  \n\nTo address improper payments\
      \ caused by inability to access the data or information needed, we are working\
      \ to simplify our notices and communications.  Some of our notices and communications\
      \ can be complex, lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can\
      \ sometimes result from the complexity of our programs and legal requirements\
      \ to communicate certain information.  We published several blogs and Social\
      \ Security TV slides in field office waiting areas on the importance of reporting\
      \ relationship changes to us for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance\
      \ beneficiaries to improve the responsiveness of beneficiaries and recipients\

      \ updating the Work Activity Report (SSA-821), to make it more understandable\
      \ and more likely to be completed by applicants and beneficiaries.  We use form\
      \ SSA-821 to collect information about applicant and beneficiary’s work, applicable\
      \ work incentives, and non-work-related pay.  It allows us to make accurate\
      \ decisions as to whether beneficiaries are performing Substantial Gainful Activity.\
      \  In addition, we developed a Work Incentive Notice pilot for increasing completion\
      \ of the Work Activity Report by sending beneficiaries pre-notices that incorporate\

      period
    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience\
      \ (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process\
      \ all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake\
      \ processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,\
      \ reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed\
      \ entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the\
      \ application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available\
      \ in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability\
      \ Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY)\
      \ 2023, there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software\
      \ performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.\
      \  In December 2023, CCE Announcements became available.  Now, when updates\
      \ are made within CCE, the technicians receive a brief message the first time\
      \ they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided\
      \ for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement\
      \ is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information\
      \ within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related to\
      \ CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including\
      \ the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the\
      \ User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing\
      \ and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page\
      \ with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements,\
      \ we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation,\
      \ which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism\
      \ to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error\
      \ and reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating\
      \ the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional\
      \ application.  We also plan to release our first retirement benefit application\
      \ within CCE.  We will test it in a few field offices before a national release.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.\
      \  The CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review\
      \ process, increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.\
      \  The multifaceted product is comprised of four separate workstreams:  Work\
      \ CDR, Medical CDR, Electronic Disability Collect System (EDCS), and CDRs Modernization,\
      \ across several component business and systems sponsors.  In FY 2023, CDR product\
      \ released the i454 which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to\
      \ file the SSA-454 or a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online\
      \ version, the technician's process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.\
      \  In FY 2024, we released Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the EDCS\
      \ that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.  We made the eWork system\
      \ Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We are currently developing a modernized\
      \ replacement of eWork which will be integrated into the existing EDCS application.\
      \  The eWork replacement will reinforce policy and intuitively drive best practices\
      \ to reduce improper payments.  In FY 2024 we made technical releases for the\
      \ eWork replacement.  We will release the minimum viable product to technicians\
      \ in tandem with retiring eWork by the end of FY 2025.  Subsequent releases\
      \ will be scheduled for FY 2026 if funding permits.  \n\nTo address improper\
      \ payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed\
      \ the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer\
      \ relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information\
      \ about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our\
      \ employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving\
      \ the overall customer experience.  In FY 2023, TED added Registration and Customer\
      \ Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.\
      \  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  In February\
      \ 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all field offices and workload support\
      \ units.  In March 2024, an additional task called External Tasks became available.\
      \  External Tasks provides technicians the ability to open commonly used applications\
      \ directly from TED.  As of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications\
      \ available via TED.  We plan to continue to enhance the customer composite\
      \ by bringing in and displaying more customer information from other systems.\
      \  Releases to enhance existing functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We\
      \ are also working on plans to expand to other user groups, such as the field\
      \ and regional offices including Appellate Operations.  Integration of the technician\
      \ facing portion of Visitor Intake Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In FY 2021, we pursued\
      \ a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs that\
      \ will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation (RPA),\
      \ or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with processing\
      \ manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, several BOTs\
      \ have been created and placed into production.  In FY 2024, we added a BOT\
      \ utilized by headquarters analysts, that helped reduce stale Registration,\
      \ Appointment and Services for Representatives (RASR) appointments.  Technicians\
      \ are able to use the BOT to review and terminate stale appointments in the\
      \ RASR database.  Use of BOTs reduces keystrokes and manual coding and detects\
      \ exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In FY 2025, we plan to enhance the\
      \ existing RPA scripts and identify opportunities to automate computations and\
      \ inputs to reduce input errors.  We are making a long-term investment in robotics\
      \ technology using the software to improve business processes and eliminate\
      \ manual actions.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents\
      \ electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into\
      \ production.  In September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature,\
      \ which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience\
      \ and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded\
      \ the eSignature/Upload Documents service to all field offices and workload\
      \ support units nationwide.  This release allows customers to access the service\
      \ with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also, in March 2024, eSignature/Upload\
      \ Documents became available to all Field Offices and Workload Support Units\
      \ Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months, we began releasing mobile\
      \ friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms for customer completion.\
      \  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated 10-day follow up reminder\
      \ and confirmation of successful submission emails to enhance communication\
      \ with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated the service with my\
      \ Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text communications.\
      \  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms for a mobile\
      \ friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and evidence\
      \ types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social Security\
      \ and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including Upload\
      \ Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand to 3rd party\
      \ forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional support\
      \ to our mutual customers."

      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the
      WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  In FY 2023,
      there was an increase in improper payments related to WEP, but overall, since
      FY 2017, there has been a significant reduction in improper payments related
      to WEP and GPO.  In March 2024, we provided detailed information to technicians
      regarding the importance of securing non-covered Government Pension data timely,
      when applicable, in order to calculate the correct benefit amount.  In FY 2024,
      we developed a new policy to address multiple non-covered pensions distributed
      or terminated at different periods of time.  This will provide a consistent
      national policy.  We plan to publish the policy in FY 2025.

      \ Insurance beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for higher benefits.\
      \  In October 2023, we mailed out more than 15,000 notices to beneficiaries\
      \ receiving spousal benefits and more than 28,000 to surviving spouses who may\
      \ potentially be eligible for higher retirement benefits on their own records.\
      \  In April 2024, we issued a policy reminder to technicians to review cases\
      \ carefully to determine whether retroactivity is applicable for surviving spouse\
      \ benefits.  We also developed a “Potential Entitlements” Tactical Plan to educate\
      \ people who may be eligible for Social Security benefits, particularly Survivors’\
      \ benefits and Supplemental Security Income.  It also includes targeted outreach\
      \ by providing materials to third parties and our regional communications staffs.\
      \  We also conducted a longitudinal study on mailers in fiscal year (FY) 2024.\
      \  The draft is currently in the review/clearance process.  Communications tactics\

    Description_Action_Taken: "To address improper payments caused by failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience\
      \ (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process\
      \ all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake\
      \ processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,\
      \ reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed\
      \ entitlements, and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the\
      \ application.  Currently, only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available\
      \ in CCE with additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability\
      \ Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY)\
      \ 2023, there were several CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software\
      \ performance, correct software problems, and respond to employee feedback.\
      \  In December 2023, CCE Announcements became available.  Now, when updates\
      \ are made within CCE, the technicians receive a brief message the first time\
      \ they access the application describing the changes.  Hyperlinks will be provided\
      \ for the user to access more in-depth information, if desired.  This enhancement\
      \ is designed to assist our busy technicians by providing just-in-time information\
      \ within CCE, so they do not have to pause and locate references related to\
      \ CCE.  In June 2024, we released enhancements to several CCE pages including\
      \ the Special Enrollment Period page and Alien Deportation page to upgrade the\
      \ User Experience Framework.  We also released an enhancement to the Printing\
      \ and Signature page that replaces the existing Printing and Signatures page\
      \ with redesigned Print, Sign, and Document Summary pages.  For upcoming enhancements,\
      \ we are working on a multi-phased implementation for SSI payment continuation,\
      \ which will automate the current legacy process to a modernized input mechanism\
      \ to initiate and remove payment continuation.  This will reduce user error\
      \ and reliance on the regionally developed appeals application.  We are incorporating\
      \ the start date functionality within CCE, which is housed within a regional\
      \ application.  We also plan to release our first retirement benefit application\
      \ within CCE.  We will test it in a few field offices before a national release.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.\
      \  The CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review\
      \ process, increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.\
      \  The multifaceted product is comprised of four separate workstreams:  Work\
      \ CDR, Medical CDR, Electronic Disability Collect System (EDCS), and CDRs Modernization,\
      \ across several component business and systems sponsors.  In FY 2023, CDR product\
      \ released the i454 which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to\
      \ file the SSA-454 or a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online\
      \ version, the technician's process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.\
      \  In FY 2024, we released Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the EDCS\
      \ that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.  We made the eWork system\
      \ Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We are currently developing a modernized\
      \ replacement of eWork which will be integrated into the existing EDCS application.\
      \  The eWork replacement will reinforce policy and intuitively drive best practices\
      \ to reduce improper payments.  In FY 2024 we made technical releases for the\
      \ eWork replacement.  We will release the minimum viable product to technicians\
      \ in tandem with retiring eWork by the end of FY 2025.  Subsequent releases\
      \ will be scheduled for FY 2026 if funding permits.  \n\nTo address improper\
      \ payments caused by failure to access data or information needed, we developed\
      \ the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our enterprise customer\
      \ relationship management solution that will provide a single location for information\
      \ about our customers’ interactions with the agency to make it easier for our\
      \ employees to help the public and increases efficiency and accuracy, improving\
      \ the overall customer experience.  In FY 2023, TED added Registration and Customer\
      \ Support, Upload Document workflows, and made general improvements to the application.\
      \  In June 2023, TED became available for use in the Boston region.  In February\
      \ 2024, TED was rolled out nationally to all field offices and workload support\
      \ units.  In March 2024, an additional task called External Tasks became available.\
      \  External Tasks provides technicians the ability to open commonly used applications\
      \ directly from TED.  As of June 2024, there are a total of 24 external applications\
      \ available via TED.  We plan to continue to enhance the customer composite\
      \ by bringing in and displaying more customer information from other systems.\
      \  Releases to enhance existing functionality occur on a quarterly basis.  We\
      \ are also working on plans to expand to other user groups, such as the field\
      \ and regional offices including Appellate Operations.  Integration of the technician\
      \ facing portion of Visitor Intake Process Rewrite is planned for late FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information\
      \ needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In FY 2021, we pursued\
      \ a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs that\
      \ will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation (RPA),\
      \ or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with processing\
      \ manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, several BOTs\
      \ have been created and placed into production.  In FY 2024, we added a BOT\
      \ utilized by headquarters analysts, that helped reduce stale Registration,\
      \ Appointment and Services for Representatives (RASR) appointments.  Technicians\
      \ are able to use the BOT to review and terminate stale appointments in the\
      \ RASR database.  Use of BOTs reduces keystrokes and manual coding and detects\
      \ exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In FY 2025, we plan to enhance the\
      \ existing RPA scripts and identify opportunities to automate computations and\
      \ inputs to reduce input errors.  We are making a long-term investment in robotics\
      \ technology using the software to improve business processes and eliminate\
      \ manual actions.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents\
      \ electronically.  In July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into\
      \ production.  In September 2023 we added the electronic signature feature,\
      \ which addresses the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience\
      \ and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government.  In March 2024, we expanded\
      \ the eSignature/Upload Documents service to all field offices and workload\
      \ support units nationwide.  This release allows customers to access the service\
      \ with fewer customer authentication requirements.  Also, in March 2024, eSignature/Upload\
      \ Documents became available to all Field Offices and Workload Support Units\
      \ Nationwide.  In April 2024 and subsequent months, we began releasing mobile\
      \ friendly web fillable forms in place of PDF forms for customer completion.\
      \  Additionally, in June 2024, we added an automated 10-day follow up reminder\
      \ and confirmation of successful submission emails to enhance communication\
      \ with our customers.  In September 2024, we integrated the service with my\
      \ Social Security and also provide a new option for SMS/text communications.\
      \  We plan to complete the following:  continue to webify forms for a mobile\
      \ friendly experience; continue increasing the number of forms and evidence\
      \ types available; develop a self-service option accessible from my Social Security\
      \ and SSA.gov; continue enhanced customer communications by including Upload\
      \ Document service option in all paper request notices; and expand to 3rd party\
      \ forms, allowing advocates and organizations to provide additional support\
      \ to our mutual customers."

      \ access the data or information needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners\
      \ from government and private sectors in collaboration with our agency business\
      \ sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community\
      \ of Practice (DXCOP) and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to\
      \ engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we implemented two new incoming\
      \ data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These data exchanges assist\
      \ in avoiding improper payments when a child's foster placement has changed.\
      \  For FY 2024, 24 states/entities signed an Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ and are participating, and 10 states signed the Information Exchange Agreement\
      \ of State Foster Data Exchanges.  These data exchanges assist in avoiding improper\
      \ payments when a child's foster placement has changed.  We continue to engage\
      \ State agencies for the purpose of expanding this exchange.  In June and September\
      \ 2024, we held DXCOP meetings.  We continue to engage State agencies for the\
      \ purpose of expanding this exchange.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts\
      \ with the DXCOP and the States Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage\
      \ more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices toward streamlining\
      \ the exchange of data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by failure\
      \ to access data or information needed, we are improving our death data processing.\
      \  We collect data from a variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.\
      \  We have a contract with every State Bureau of Vital Statistics (the custodians\
      \ for death records) and with some jurisdictions to provide us death data. \
      \ Since 2002, we worked with States that want and are able to build a streamlined\
      \ death registration process known as Electronic Death Registration (EDR). \
      \ As of January 2022, all 50 States report deaths through the EDR process. \
      \ We plan to continue making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving\
      \ the quality and processing of death data, and updating historical death records\
      \ in our databases.  In April 2024, for processing death reports, we issued\
      \ a reminder to technicians to the Death Information Processing System for reports\
      \ of death for enumerated individuals.  To improve the completeness of our death\
      \ information, we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association\
      \ for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of\
      \ historical State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity,\
      \ and completeness of our death data.  \n\nTo address improper payments caused\
      \ by inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access\
      \ data or information needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment\
      \ Compensation Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’\
      \ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL),\
      \ provides coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of\
      \ FECA benefits can offset Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)\
      \ benefits.  We have agreed with DOL to move forward with our request for DOL\
      \ FECA data.  We are working to finalize the agreement for DOL to provide FECA\
      \ payment data to assist us in our offset requirements.  In December 2023, the\
      \ agency established an eCOMP system Memorandum of Understanding with DOL to\
      \ obtain FECA benefits to allow the agency to offset OASDI benefits and prevent\
      \ or reduce overpayments.  Technicians can complete an ad hoc query in eCOMP\
      \ to obtain FECA data, the FECA payment status, dates, amounts and it is immediately\
      \ available to the technician via the eCOMP portal.  In April 2024, we provided\
      \ reminders on how to process initial claims with workers compensation lump-sum\
      \ settlement allegations.  We expect the exchange to be completed in FY 2025.\
      \  \n\nTo address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or\
      \ information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and\
      \ to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage\
      \ reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial\
      \ payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget\
      \ Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  In\
      \ February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) describing\
      \ the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers\
      \ to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves\
      \ service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.\
      \  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which\
      \ is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we\
      \ completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue\
      \ diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from\
      \ PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review\
      \ and action.  We plan to implement PIE in the Spring of 2025 through a phased\
      \ approach.  This timeline will ensure compliance with rulemaking requirements\

  act17_1: 'To focus our efforts, we have a team dedicated to monitoring and measuring
    the effectiveness on the progress of improper payment mitigation strategies and
    corrective actions.  We have the Improper Payments Alignment Strategy where we
    conduct root cause analysis of the improper payment, obtain agency-wide engagement,
    and agreement of actions needed to remedy improper payment issues.  This approach
    helps us develop corrective actions and mitigation strategies that are focused
    on the root cause of improper payments.


    Program integrity workloads ensure that we issue program dollars appropriately.  We
    conducted both medical and work continuing disability reviews to determine if
    a beneficiary remains eligible for benefits.


    For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our failure
    to access data or information needed, our corrective actions and strategies fall
    within several high-level categories such as automation, business process improvement
    (including program and policy simplification), and training to improve accuracy.  We
    also evaluated the completed corrective actions to determine whether changes in
    the outcome can be attributed to the implementation of the corrective actions.  We
    compared data before and after the implementation of corrective actions to determine
    whether we need additional actions.


    We are investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees
    with user-friendly systems and tools to better serve the public, including a single
    unified process for benefit applications and a consolidated source with all information
    and agency interactions with our customers.  To meet the challenges of our growing
    workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies
    and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business
    processes.  We will continue to issue periodic reminders and policy clarifications,
    as needed.


    We plan to utilize an automated information exchange with a commercial payroll
    data provider to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages as our corrective
    action for the root cause of overpayments outside the agency’s control due to
    our inability to access data or information needed.  This exchange is referred
    to as the Payroll Information Exchange.  Additionally, we are promoting timely
    wage reporting and issuing reminders on reporting responsibilities.  From October
    2023 through February 2024, we released social media posts on Facebook and Twitter
    sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn about the importance
    of reporting wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.


    We understand that reminders will not solve all problems related to improper payments
    caused by root cause factors outside the agency’s control.  However, we will influence
    change where possible by simplifying communications and the way information is
    presented as our approach to reduce cognitive burden and improve understanding
    and readability.


    We will continue our quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work
    including medical disability reviews.


    For improper payments within the agency’s control, we will continue to invest
    in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly
    systems and tools to better serve the public.  To meet the challenges of our growing
    workloads and provide the best service possible, we will streamline our procedures
    and automate more of our business processes.  We will enhance the quality of training
    to better equip our workforce.


    For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we are addressing the challenge
    of reliance on self-reporting by promoting timely wage reporting and issuing reminders
    on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to utilize an automated information exchange
    with commercial payroll data providers to reduce the reliance on self-reporting
    of wages.  This exchange is referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange.  We
    plan to continue current computer-matching agreements (CMAs) that yield a positive
    cost-benefit ratio, expand effective CMAs to meet additional program needs, research
    current programs, work with internal stakeholders to identify data exchange needs,
    and pursue new data exchanges with potential partners.'
  act17_2: 'The primary cause of improper payments within the agency’s control is
    our failure to take timely and proper actions.  The primary cause of improper
    payments outside the agency’s control occurs when we are unable to access data
    needed to calculate a payment because the beneficiary or a third-party either
    did not provide the requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary
    to compute the accurate benefit amount.  It occurs because of beneficiaries or
    representative payees’ failure to report changes.  For this reporting period,
    consistent with prior years, much of the overpayments continue to be attributed
    to employment.  Therefore, to address improper payments caused by inability to
    access the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information
    needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing
    new wage reporting tools, such as an automated information exchange with commercial
    payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act
    of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  PIE will
    allow us to receive monthly wage and employment information automatically through
    an information exchange with a participating payroll data provider and it will
    improve payment accuracy, reduce improper payments, and reduce the reporting burden
    on individuals when they authorize us to obtain this information through an information
    exchange and we receive it.  We also anticipate that implementation of an information
    exchange will result in more efficient use of our limited administrative resources
    because our technicians would reduce the amount of time they spend:  manually
    requesting this information from payroll data providers and employers; manually
    entering data into our systems from an individual’s pay records; contacting individuals;
    and assisting individuals with the results of incomplete or untimely reporting.'

  cyp15: 'Yes'
  cyp20_2: We have been maintaining a high payment accuracy rate.  We strive to pay
    the right person, the right amount at the right time to reduce improper payments.  We
    have centralized the coordination and monitoring of agency-wide improper payment
    initiatives.  We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies to focus
    on our corrective actions to address the root causes of leading causes of improper

    cyp2_1: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments within the agency’s
      control are caused by our failure to access data or information needed.  These
      overpayments occur when we have access to the data or information we need to
      accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information
      provided to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The leading
      cause of the overpayment was our failure to timely update records with reported
      changes or take appropriate action.  An incorrect action could be due to incorrect
      policy interpretation and application, mathematical error, typographical error,
      or delay in input.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, we provide
      training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions
      to improve accuracy when possible.

    cyp4_1: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments outside the
      agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to calculate
      a payment because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide the
      requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute
      the accurate benefit amount.  It occurs because of beneficiaries’ or representative
      payees’ failure to report changes.  For this reporting period, the leading cause
      of overpayments outside the agency’s control was primarily our reliance on timely
      self-reporting of employment and wage information.
  pro1: 'The annual sample in our Stewardship Reviews is sufficient to provide statistically
    reliable data on the overall payment accuracy.  However, the annual sample does
    not provide statistically reliable information about individual deficiencies in
    a given year; therefore, we use an average of a 5-year period.  The data reported
    is based on fiscal year 2023 (single year) stewardship findings.


    We are responsible for issuing over $1 trillion in benefit payments annually;
    even the slightest error in the overall payment process can result in billions
    of dollars in improper payments.  It is important to note that we maintain a high
    payment accuracy rate.  As good stewards of our programs and as required by law,
    we continue our quality reviews, cost-effective program integrity work, and payment
    accuracy efforts to ensure individuals receive the benefits for which they are
    eligible.  We are examining our internal policies and procedures for opportunities
    to improve so that we can maintain a high payment accuracy rate.  Recently we
    established a team to review our overpayment policies and procedures to further
    improve how we serve our customers.'
  rap5: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that has
    always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
    existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
    assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and operating
    effectively.


    As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
    management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
    Act.


    We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
    membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
    clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


    Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent on
    having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our employees
    who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for benefits and
    other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is critical to maintain
    a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship work.


    Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
    to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
    investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
    digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and mobile
    accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital services
    that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers to service
    to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and employees.  We
    are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service while reducing
    manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient funding is necessary
    to continue to modernize our IT.


    Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
    information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
    to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
    controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
    and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
    a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on continuous
    improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support of Executive
    Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of Management and
    Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
    Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital identity processes
    to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents
    Act.


    Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
    network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
    cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
    partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
    flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.'
  rap6: The fiscal year 2025 President’s Budget included resources for internal controls
    to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship responsibilities
    and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested $1.903 billion
    in dedicated funding for program integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use,
    such as our medical Continuing Disability Reviews, work Continuing Disability
    Reviews, and the Cooperative Disability Investigations program, save billions
    of program dollars with a proportionally small investment of administrative resources.
  rnp3: 'For the root cause of overpayments within the agency’s control due to our
    failure to access data or information needed, our corrective actions and strategies
    fall within several high-level categories such as automation, business process
    improvement (including program and policy simplification), and training to improve
    accuracy.


    For improper payments outside the agency’s control, we are addressing the challenge
    of reliance on self-reporting by promoting timely wage reporting and issuing reminders
    on reporting responsibilities.  We plan to utilize an automated information exchange
    with commercial payroll data providers to reduce the reliance on self-reporting
    of wages.  This exchange is referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange.


    We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure stewardship
    and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We monitor the status
    of corrective actions through bi-monthly meetings and quarterly senior executive
    meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed a comprehensive approach
    to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives that target the
    root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts serve to prioritize
    and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The purpose
    of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that will have
    the most significant impact to the detection and prevention of improper payments.  By
    identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments, we channel
    our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally responsible
    as we implement a corrective action plan.


    In fiscal year 2024 we completed our annual updates that are part of the monitoring
    and measuring the effectiveness of completed corrective actions on the leading
    causes of improper payments.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore
    cost-effective corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we
    continue to note that the complexity of our Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
    program makes it extremely difficult to determine the dollar value associated
    with a particular corrective action.'
  rnp4: "We are committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensuring\
    \ the public has confidence that we manage their tax dollars wisely.  We demonstrate\
    \ a commitment to sound management practices.  To ensure stewardship and the efficient\
    \ administration of our programs, we have established performance measures in\
    \ our Annual Performance Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2023–2024 to track our progress.\
    \  Under Strategic Objective 3.1 – Improve the Accuracy and Administration of\
    \ our Programs, there are two performance measures directly related to reduction\
    \ of improper payments:\n\n3.1a - Improve the integrity of the Supplemental Security\
    \ Income program by focusing our efforts on reducing overpayments \n\n3.1b - Maintain\
    \ a high payment accuracy rate by reducing overpayments, in the Old-Age, Survivors,\
    \ and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program\n\nUnder our annual Performance Accountability\
    \ and Communication System, all agency managers have a critical element called\
    \ “Manages Performance.”  This element includes two performance standards related\
    \ to preventing and reducing improper payments:  establishes and maintains suitable\
    \ internal controls to prevent improper payments; and uses established guidelines\
    \ to reduce and recover improper payments.\n\nWe assess managers throughout the\
    \ agency on these standards each year and hold them accountable for meeting improper\
    \ payment reduction targets.  Each agency component adds expectations that are\
    \ more detailed for their positions describing what is expected for meeting these\
    \ performance standards.\n\nSenior Executive performance plans must clearly align\
    \ with organizational goals and objectives under the Results Driven Critical Element.\
    \  Performance levels in the performance requirements must reflect agency targets.\n\
    \nWe established the Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), consisting of senior\
    \ executive membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention,\
    \ formulating clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.\
    \  The Deputy Commissioner of the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight (OARO)\
    \ serves as the executive chair for the IPOB.  To further our focus on reducing\
    \ improper payments, in FY 2019, we established an Improper Payments Prevention\
    \ Team now referred to as the Improper Payments Prevention Branch, in OARO.  The\
    \ team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payments Alignment\
    \ Strategies (IPAS) that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate\
    \ the root causes of improper payments.  As part of our IPAS, we will evaluate\
    \ the effectiveness of each planned or ongoing mitigation initiative.  Additionally,\
    \ we will determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying\
    \ causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies, as\
    \ needed.  IPOB is responsible for reviewing, approving, and implementing all\
    \ improper payment initiatives.\n\nWe have a strong internal control environment\
    \ that has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management\
    \ processes.  We directly leverage our existing internal control environment and\
    \ assurance processes to provide reasonable assurance that our internal controls\
    \ over improper payments are in place and operating effectively.\n\nAs part of\
    \ our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide management\
    \ control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.\n\
    \nThe effective internal controls we incorporate into our business processes and\
    \ financial management systems, as well as the program integrity efforts, support\
    \ our Commissioner’s annual assurance statement to the President and Congress.\n\
    \nIn April 2019, we established the Enterprise Fraud Risk Management (EFRM) program\
    \ to systematically assess fraud risks across our major programmatic and administrative\
    \ areas.  Through our EFRM program we have conducted multiple fraud risk assessments\
    \ on key areas such as Disability, Electronic Services, Administrative Services,\
    \ and the Representative Payee program.  After each fraud risk assessment, our\
    \ senior executives review each fraud risk and determine whether our controls\
    \ are effective or whether we need to develop additional controls to further reduce\
    \ the risk.  For each risk designated as “reduce” by our executives, we develop\
    \ additional mitigation strategies to further prevent or detect the fraud.  The\
    \ risk response and the designated mitigation strategies form the basis of the\
    \ fraud risk profile for each fraud area.\n\nWe completed a maintenance fraud\
    \ risk assessment of Agency’s Administrative Services during FY 2024 and continued\
    \ the reassessment of the disability fraud risk profile, consistent with the Government\
    \ Accountability Office guidance, to reassess fraud risk profiles on a three-year\
    \ cycle.  We also finalized the Fraud Risk Profiles for the Enumeration program\
    \ at the end of calendar year 2023.\n\nFor recovery of overpayments, effective\
    \ March 25, 2024, we changed existing policy and procedure for recovering OASDI\
    \ overpayments.  Policy has been to default to full benefit withholding.  However,\
    \ with the change, we began applying a default of 10 percent withholding rate,\
    \ or $10 per month, whichever is more, to an overpaid individual.  There will\
    \ be limited exceptions to this change, such as when an overpayment resulted from\
    \ fraud.\n\nAdditionally, when negotiating a rate of overpayment recovery, we\
    \ traditionally required documentation of income and expenses for repayment timeframes\
    \ that extended beyond 36 months.  In February 2024, we changed our policy to\
    \ extend this timeframe to 60 months and reduced the burden on our beneficiaries\
    \ to provide additional financial and resource information."

Description: The OASDI program provides monthly benefits to qualified individuals
  who are retired or disabled, dependents of eligible beneficiaries, and surviving
  dependents of deceased workers.  We maintain high payment accuracy rates in our
  OASDI program.  Improper payments (overpayments and underpayments) result from 1)
  beneficiariesâ€™ failure to report required information to the agency and 2) the
  agency not taking timely and appropriate action.  We are addressing these challenges
  by promoting timely wage reporting, working towards automation of wages received
  from payroll information exchanges, and offering a service for customers to electronically
  submit certain technician-requested evidence and forms.
