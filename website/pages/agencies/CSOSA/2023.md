detail_agy1: Based on prior financial statement audits, a determination of strong
  internal controls from CSOSA internal controls testing, and the results of CSOSA
  internal testing of its FY 2023 payment transactions, CSOSA believes that the CSP
  and PSA programs have low inherent risks of improper payment,

detail_ara2_2: null
detail_ara2_3: To employ one GS 12 FTE to perform recapture audits will cost $93K
  to $122K per year. Given that the CSOSA has a very low risk of improper payment
  as a result of risk assessments done in FY2023, it is not cost beneficial for the
  CSOSA to employ an FTE to perform recapture audits. Another option is to contract
  out the recapture audits, below is a cost analysis using GSA contract rates for
  Castro & Company, LLC.  Based on the analysis below, it would cost CSOSA $41K to
  recapture any improper payments.  It is our determination then that it is not cost
  beneficial for the CSOSA to employ a contractor to perform recapture audits.
detail_ara2_3_2: CSOSA consists of two component programs, the Community Supervision
  Program (CSP), supervising adult offenders on probation, parole and supervised release,
  and the Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), supervising defendants on pretrial release.

detail_dpa5: 'CSOSA and its financial system (OFF) service provider, the Department
  of Interior-Interior Business Center (IBC), use the DNP Initiative to review payment
  eligibility for purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments. The DNP
  Validation is completed each weekend.  The IBC receives an email from DNP notifying
  them that the Continuous Monitoring results are refreshed.  The IBC will refresh
  the OFF report data the first workday of the week.  IBC sends an email notification
  immediately after the data is made available.  Upon receipt of this email notification,
  CSOSA Office of Financial Management (OFM) will run the OFF Report and format based
  on the three available reports: Matched to Vendor, Matched Vendors Tied to PO, and
  Matched Vendors Tied to AP. The three identified reports include vendors with matched
  results of “Possible”, “Probable”, and “Conclusive”.  The information reported to
  the CSOSA Office of Procurement (Procurement) is based on those vendors with a “Conclusive”
  match result.  OFM issues an email to Procurement on a weekly basis identifying
  those vendors who appeared on the DNP Report. Prior to submitting a new OFF Vendor
  Request form, the Agency must ensure the vendor is not referenced on the DNP List.  The
  information is provided weekly by email to all credit cardholders to ensure they
  are not using any vendors identified on the DNP Report. CSOSA Accounts Payable staff
  are informed of this information as it pertains to reposting monthly bank statements
  and Budget Analysts are informed as well to assist them when approving requisitions.
  Prior to submitting a new Vendor Request form, CSOSA must ensure the vendor is not
  referenced on the DNP List.  OFM informs IBC to end date positively identified vendors
  in OFF via email.  CSOSA has neither identified a material amount nor realized a
  reduction of improper payments attributable to implementing the DNP Initiative capabilities.
  Rather, CSOSA’s DNP Initiative implementation has proven that CSOSA has robust and
  effective internal controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal
  funds.

detail_pcp14: CSOSA is a small agency and does not have an OIG office.  We are planning
  to use our recently created Quality Improvement Unit (QIU) to conduct these OIG
  reviews moving forward.  The CSOSA Payment Integrity activities for FY23 will be
  the first year reviewed.
