detail_ara2_3: The amount if improper payments related to the agency is immaterial
  to the financial statements.  Therefore, an audit to recover such payments would
  not be cost-effective for the agency.  It would cost more to perform the audit than
  the funds we need to recover.

detail_exs1: 'CPSC has two programs we report over based on our appropriations which
  are "Payroll" and "Non-Payroll."  CPSC has no improper payments related to Payroll
  program activities in FY22.  CPSC had improper payments in three categories related
  to Non-Payroll program activities in FY22: Overpayments in the amount of $7,124.00
  related to Administrative Processing Errors and then $1,263.00 related to statutory
  requirements not met.  And an underpayment of $.60 related to administrative processing
  error.  Overall CPSC was compliant with IPERIA reporting related to FY21 in the
  OIG Audit Report.'
