detail_agy1: 'Despite the recent Office of Inspector General''s  agency non-compliance
  finding this year, the Environmental Protection Agency previously had 10 straight
  years of compliance with Payment Integrity statutes. By the end of FY2023  the agency
  expects to have rectified any concerns raised by the OIG.

detail_ara2_3: Past experience has demonstrated that the low dollar value of improper
  payments recovered by an external payment recapture auditor resulted in an effort
  that was not cost-effective for the agency or the contractor. Therefore, EPA no
  longer uses a payment recapture audit firm to conduct formal payment recapture audits.  Nevertheless,
  the agency performs overpayment recovery activities internally, leveraging the work
  of agency employees and agency resources. As part of this process, each payment
  stream is routinely monitored to assure the effectiveness of internal controls and
  identify issues that could give rise to overpayments. The agency’s payment review
  and recovery activities are part of its overall program of internal control over
  disbursements, which includes establishing and assessing internal controls to prevent
  improper payments, reviewing disbursements, assessing root causes of error, developing
  corrective action plans where appropriate, and tracking the recovery of overpayments.

detail_arp18: The EPA uses various methods to recover improper payments. For Grants,
  Contracts, and Commodities, collection notices  are sent out via Pay.gov. In-service
  Payroll improper payments are rectified through salary offsets or supplements. Post-service
  collection recoveries are initiated through letter and/or email with repayments
  directed to Pay.gov. For Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds recoveries
  typically occur through off-sets from future payments.

detail_dpa5: For FY 2022, the EPA reviewed 130,822 payments with the total amount
  of $2,422,597,337 with no payments be flagged for review. The agency reviewed a
  similar number of payments and total amount results in FY 2021 also with no payments
  flagged for review. In the prior three years, three payments were flagged for review
  but ultimately adjudicated as proper payments.
detail_exs1: "Over the past four years, the Environmental Protection Agency has moved\
  \ from having five of its 10 programs considered susceptible to significant Improper\
  \ Payments to having none as of the end of the FY2021. \nThis year the agency's\
  \ Office of the Inspector General found the EPA non-complaint with the Payment Integrity\
  \ Information Act; however, the OIG did not identify any specific programs or payment\
  \ streams as susceptible to significant improper payments. While the EPA does not\
  \ agree with the non-compliance findings, the agency has proposed corrective actions\
  \ that align both with the OIG’s report recommendations and the current steps the\
  \ EPA is undertaking to carry out enhanced payments oversight due to significantly\
  \ increased funding (described below). Implementation is under way while the EPA\
  \ waits to receive a formal response from the OIG on the proposed corrective actions.\n\
  In FY2022, the EPA was a part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This\
  \ bipartisan infrastructure deal will expand access to clean drinking water, provide\
  \ electric school buses to school districts across America, tackle the climate crisis,\
  \ advance environmental justice, and invest in communities that have too often been\
  \ left behind. The EPA received roughly $60 billion (to be distributed over the\
  \ next five years) in supplementary funding to move out on supporting actions to\
  \ these objectives. To ensure the proper stewardship of the funding, the Office\
  \ of the Chief Financial Officer established an extensive program integrity framework\
  \ which would aid the agency in assessing the risks, implementing internal controls,\
  \ and preparing for oversight engagements. The goal of the program is to push the\
  \ planning and control needed to protect the funding early in the life-cycle process.\
  \ As the program moves into its second year in FY2023, it is an opportunity for\
  \ the agency to further safeguard its public resources against fraud, waste, and\
  \ abuse.  \n"
