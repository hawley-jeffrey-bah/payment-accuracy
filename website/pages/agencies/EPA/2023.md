detail_ara2_3: 'The PIIA requires agencies to conduct payment recapture audit reviews
  in any program expending more than $1 million annually. The low dollar value of
  improper payments recovered by an external payment recapture auditor led to the
  determination it was not cost-effective for the agency or the contractor. As a result,
  the EPA no longer uses a payment recapture audit firm to conduct formal payment
  recapture audits. Nevertheless, the agency performs payment reviews internally,
  leveraging the work of agency employees and agency resources.

detail_dpa5: "The PIIA requires federal agencies to implement the Do Not Pay initiative,\
  \ a government-wide solution designed to prevent payment errors and detect waste,\
  \ fraud, and abuse in programs administered by the federal government. The EPA’s\
  \ payments are screened by the Department of the Treasury’s DNP working system to\
  \ detect improper payments. The Treasury analyzes each agency’s payments and provides\
  \ a monthly report itemizing any payments that were made to potentially ineligible\
  \ recipients. These potential matches are identified when the name of an agency’s\
  \ payee matches the name of an individual or entity listed in federal data sources\
  \ contained in the Treasury’s DNP working system. \n\nIn FY 2023, the Treasury screened\
  \ the EPA payments through the following DNP data sources on a post- payment basis:\
  \ the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and the General Services\
  \ Administration’s System for Award Management Exclusion List. During FY 2023 a\
  \ total of 226,737 EPA payments worth $3.76 billion of the EPA payments were screened,\
  \ and no improper payments were identified. \n\nThe EPA’s Payment Integrity Program\
  \ is supported by two other US Treasury screening tools, the Automated Standard\
  \ Application for Payments and the Offset Program, to support its Payment Integrity\
  \ work.   Under this process 55,363 EPA payments totaling $ 5.5 billion were made\
  \ using ASAP, including having ASAP’s grantee listing is monitored by the Treasury.\
  \  \n\nIn addition, the agency payments are routinely monitored by the Treasury\
  \ Offset Program, which offsets federal payments to recipients with delinquent federal\
  \ nontax debt. These different tools provide a valuable external check of the agency’s\
  \ payment integrity."
detail_exs1: "In its annual compliance audit, released on May 16, 2023, the agency's\
  \ Office of the Inspector General found the EPA was complaint with the requirements\
  \ of the Payment Integrity Information Act. This marks the 9th time over the last\
  \ 11 years, the EPA has been determined to be compliant with Payment Integrity statutes.\n\
  \nWith the enactment of the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA) & Inflation\
  \ Reduction Act (IRA), the EPA has received over $100 billion in supplemental funding,\
  \ which has created an unprecedented opportunity to advance agency efforts to protect\
  \ human health and the environment and help the nation address challenges such as\
  \ climate change, environmental justice, and strengthening our nation’s infrastructure.\
  \ To ensure proper tracking and reporting of the IIJA and IRA resources, the agency\
  \ has developed new account coding structures to precisely track dozens of new IIJA\
  \ and IRA budget line items, enhanced our dashboards so managers and staff can efficiently\
  \ access budget and financial data in real time, and improved oversight functions\
  \ to identify major risks and controls to ensure proper stewardship of IIJA and\
  \ IRA funding.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of FY 2023, the EPA completed off-cycle\
  \ qualitative risk assessments of all programs and payment streams to address the\
  \ unresolved, prior-year OIG compliance audit findings (June 27, 2022 compliance\
  \ report) and consider the potentially increased risk as the agency had begun the\
  \ disbursement of IIJA and IRA funds. The results of risk assessments showed that\
  \ 8 of the agency’s 9 programs/payment streams were not likely to be susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments. One program (Grants) was determined to be potentially\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments, and as a result, the agency will\
  \ conduct a statistical sample of the Grants Program's outlays to determine if it\
  \ exceeds the statutory threshold for susceptibility. \n\nDue to the large increase\
  \ in the agency funding, the EPA will undertake non-statistical payment reviews\
  \ of its Contracts payment stream and increase the reviews of its Clean Water and\
  \ Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. Further, the EPA is reviewing the need for,\
  \ and timing of, unique risk assessments by breaking out new programs resulting\
  \ from the IRA funding.\n\nFrom FY 2022 to FY 2023 the amount of confirm fraud the\
  \ EPA identified dropped 99.8% (from $970,000 to $20,000). As a result, the agency\
  \ reported $0.002M of confirmed fraud in this reporting cycle. Each fiscal year,\
  \ information on the results of closed fraud cases, including the dollar amounts\
  \ of identified fraud, are provided to agency via the OIG’s Office of Investigations\
  \ which the EPA reports in the Agency Financial Report and on PaymentAccuracy.gov.\
  \ Fraud investigations may take multiple years to come to a resolution resulting\
  \ highly variable amounts from year to year. \n"

detail_pcp14: The May 16, 2023 OIG report did not contain any findings or recommendations
  for the EPA's FY 2022 Payment Integrity report. However, the audit additionally
  assessed whether the agency’s corrective actions undertaken in response to the OIG's
  prior compliance audit report (issued on June 27, 2022 on the agency’s FY 2021 payment
  integrity reporting) satisfied the requirements of the prior year recommendations.
  The report stated that the agency's corrective actions met the intent of three of
  the four corrective actions and that one of those three was awaiting completion
  in November 2023. The OIG went on to state it will evaluate EPA’s implementation
  of corrective actions in the FYs 2023 and 2024 compliance audits.
