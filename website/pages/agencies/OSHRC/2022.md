  The agency continued the practice of reviewing the General Services Administration
  Excluded Parties List (EPLS) and the System for Awards Management (formerly Central
  Contractor Registry) prior to awarding contracts and purchase orders. All payments
  made in FY 2022 were verified using the method above, except for payments to Federal

detail_exs1: 'The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Review Commission)
  did not make any improper payments in FY 2022. The agency continued the practice
  of reviewing the General Services Administration Excluded Parties List (EPLS) and
  the System for Awards Management (formerly Central Contractor Registry) prior to
  awarding contracts and purchase orders. All payments made in FY 2022 were verified
  using the method above, except for payments to Federal vendors, payroll, and credit
  card payments.


  The agency continues to attribute progress made in eliminating improper payments
  to the implementation of the program integrity activities outlined in our “Do Not
  Pay Implementation Plan.” The plan, which was implemented in FY 2013, requires agency
  staff responsible for processing invoices to focus on prevention, detection, and
  recovery. Prevention activities, which are executed prior to the payment of an invoice,
  include pre-payment audits, risk prioritization, and predictive modeling. Transactions
  that are identified as being “high risk” are subject to a second level of review
  prior to being forwarded to the Certifying Official for approval for payment. The
  Review Commission utilizes the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) for financial
  services which includes processing payments. Any funds disbursed by the Department
  of the Treasury go through Payment Integration, in which the Do Not Pay Portal automatically
  matches all Payment Automation Manager files. Detection activities, which are performed
  subsequent to payment, are based largely on reports generated by ARC. These reports
  assist with reviewing invoice processing activities. For example, the Review Commission
  analyzes a monthly report detailing the cumulative total and number of invoices
  processed during the previous 30-day reporting period. The Review Commission continued
  to implement its prevention and detection process in FY 2022.
