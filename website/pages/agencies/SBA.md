      and Liquidation SOP in August of 2023, and provided training to SBA staff and
      to lenders. At this writing, SBA is in the process of issuing additional revisions
      to the 7(a) Servicing and Liquidation SOP.  SBA plans to provide training to
      staff and lenders on the revised SOP.
    Info: The primary reasons for 7(a) Loan Guaranty Purchase improper payments included

    Info: The prevalent causes of improper payments stemmed from improper accounting
      of verified losses on disaster-damaged property, duplication of benefits not
      adequately addressed, misallocation of loan funds, improper calculation or determination
      of economic injury eligibility, and closing fees deducted from loans contrary
      to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

      such as documenting the eligible payroll costs incurred during the covered period
      for the loans.  Certain non-payroll expenses, if properly documented and calculated,
      were also eligible to be forgiven.

  \ Venues Operator Grant (SVOG), and the payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and\
  \ 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The SBA will be publishing\
  \ RRF improper payment estimates in FY 2024, has begun testing a sample population\
  \ from the SVOG program total program outlays to estimate the rate of improper payments\
  \ and if budget permits, the SBA expects to have the improper payment estimates\
  \ for the SVOG program available in FY 2025, and conducted a qualitative risk assessment\
  \ to identify the susceptibility of improper payments for the Debt Relief Program.\n\
  Requirement 1b: The OIG found the SBA did not publish payment integrity information\
  \ in the AFR or any accompanying materials for the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for\
  \ covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief\
  \ Program on the agency’s website.  The SBA will be publishing RRF improper payment\
  \ estimates in FY 2024, has begun testing a sample population from the SVOG program\
  \ total program outlays to estimate the rate of improper payments and if budget\
  \ permits, the SBA expects to have the improper payment estimates for the SVOG program\
  \ available in FY 2025, and conducted a qualitative risk assessment to identify\
  \ the susceptibility of improper payments for the Debt Relief Program.\nRequirement\
  \ 3: The OIG found the SBA did not implement adequate sampling and estimation methodology\
  \ plans that are statistically acceptable to produce accurate improper and unknown\
  \ payment estimates that are representative of the Disaster Assistance Loans, COVID-Economic\
  \ Injury Disaster Loans (COVID-EIDL), and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency\
  \ Assistance Advance (EIDL Advance) programs.  To remedy this, the OPPCFO team met\
  \ with the program office staff to understand the population reconciliation process\
  \ and perform a population reconciliation, as needed.  In addition to that, the\
  \ SBA is working closely with supporting staff to ensure reconciliations are accurate.\n\
  Requirement 4: The OIG found the SBA did not publish corrective actions for the\
  \ payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty programs under the\
  \ Debt Relief Program, the published corrective actions for PPP forgiveness and\
  \ PPP purchases were not effective, and the published corrective action plans for\
  \ the Disaster Assistance Loans program were not effective as they did not adequately\
  \ address the true root cause of improper payments.  The SBA established program\
  \ specific corrective actions to address the root cause of improper payments.  \n\
  Requirement 5b: The OIG found the SBA did not demonstrate improvements to payment\
  \ integrity for 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, 7(a) loan guaranty purchases, 504\
  \ Certified Development loan approvals, Disaster Assistance Loans, and COVID-EIDL\
  \ as the improper payment estimates increased between FYs 2022 and 2023.  In FY\
  \ 2024, the SBA developed tolerable rates for the 7(a) loan guaranty approvals,\
  \ 7(a) loan guaranty purchases, 504 Certified Development loan approvals, and Disaster\
  \ Assistance Loans programs.\nRequirement 6: The OIG found the improper and unknown\
  \ payment rate estimates were not reliable or accurate for the Disaster Assistance\
  \ Loans, COVID-EIDL, EIDL Advance, PPP loan forgiveness, and PPP loan guaranty purchases\
  \ programs and activities. SBA also published improper payment and unknown payment\
  \ rate estimates greater than 10 percent for the PPP loan forgiveness and PPP loan\
  \ guaranty purchases activities. Moreover, SBA did not report improper and unknown\
  \ payment rate estimates for the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for covered loans in\
  \ the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The SBA\
  \ is working closely with supporting staff to ensure the statistical sampling is\
  \ accurate to estimate an improper payment estimate."

detail_ara2_3: In FY 2024, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits. In prior years,
  the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses on programs subject to payment recapture
  audit, and deemed the costs to perform a payment recapture audit outweighed the
  benefits of the audit. Although a payment recapture audit is not conducted, SBA
  makes every effort to recover any improper payments identified through the improper
  payment review process or other internal review process.

detail_cap4: Improper payments oversight falls under the OPPCFO’s management and the
  internal control program, while improper payment assessments and implementing/maintaining
  successful internal controls is a shared responsibility across OPPCFO and SBA’s
  program offices. As such, within the SBA’s SOPs, there are direct linkages between
  senior management and their responsibilities for maintaining not only an effective
  internal control system, but also complying with laws and regulations. For example,
  under SOP 00 02, Internal Control Systems, management board members (i.e., Senior
  Management Council) and district directors are responsible for maintaining effective
  systems of internal controls. Additionally, under SOP 20 31, Internal Control, senior
  management is responsible for establishing and monitoring, within their areas of
  responsibility, an internal control structure that provides reasonable assurance
  that operations are being run in an efficient and effective manner and comply with
  applicable laws and regulations.  Moreover, all SES-level senior management staff
  also has an enterprise integrity element within their performance plans with a benchmark
  goal to ensure compliance with relevant policies, procedures, and controls within
  their respective organization to effectively identify, prevent, monitor, manage
  and mitigate enterprise and fraud risks; be responsible for prompt and responsive
  participation during any audit (GAO, OIG, and Financial), receiving and analyzing
  draft and final audit reports, providing timely responses to the audit organization,
  and taking corrective action when required while ensuring the accuracy of their
  organization’s information in the SBA Integrity System throughout the audit process;
  and develop and implement robust internal controls as well as rigorous improper
  payment assessments.

detail_dpa5: SBA submitted all programmatic disbursements through the DNP portal.  For
  disbursements that have not been disbursements yet, SBA would require the recipients
  to resolve the DNP finding prior to becoming eligible for SBA funding.  For disbursements
  that have already been sent to the recipient, SBA would place a hold code on the
  loan or grant and/or deny future loan or grant requests or loan relief requests
  until the recipient was able to successfully resolve the DNP finding.
detail_exs1: 'In FY 2024, the SBA has made great strides in our payment integrity
  efforts. Although the SBA was found to be non-compliant with the Payment Integrity
  Information Act (PIIA) by the OIG in their FY 2024 PIIA Compliance Audit, the SBA
  continues to make payment integrity efforts and reducing improper payments a priority.
  The SBA has already implemented several corrective actions to address the OIG recommendations
  and are continuing our efforts to implement additional corrective action plans to
  address the remaining open OIG recommendations with an anticipated closure date
  of September 2025 for all OIG recommendations identified during the FY 2024 PIIA
  Compliance audit.

  To further address risks related to improper payments, the SBA performs qualitative
  risk assessments on programs not reporting improper payment estimates to identify
  programs susceptible to significant improper payments. The SBA''s risk assessments
  are performed on a 3-year rotational basis with our last round of risk assessments
  completed in FY 2022. In FY 2024, the SBA conducted two qualitative risk assessments,
  the Growth Accelerator Fund program and the Section 1112 payments.  Through our
  risk assessment process, it was concluded that the Growth Accelerator Fund program
  was not susceptible to significant improper payments, and the Section 1112 payments
  were susceptible to significant improper payments.

  On an annual basis, the SBA monitors programmatic activities by reviewing the outlays
  data for each SBA program to identify programs that had significant changes in outlays
  and/or programs that are now in Phase 1. In FY 2024, a total of seven programs are
  in Phase 2. Of the seven programs reporting in Phase 2, four programs are major
  credit programs mandated by OMB, and three programs are programs that were created
  as a result of the pandemic response.

detail_pcp14: 'The FY 2024 PIIA Compliance Audit identified the following recommendations
  for the SBA:

  1) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the CFO to continue to provide
  training and collaborate with program office staff to ensure the timely and complete
  reconciliation of the population of transactions used for estimating improper payments
  to the GL, as needed.

  2) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the CFO to proactively seek
  and obtain guidance from OMB in the first year of a new program''s implementation
  and develop a plan to ensure compliance with PIIA reporting requirements, as needed.

  3) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the CFO to enhance existing
  procedures using the framework in the GAO Green Book to design and implement robust
  internal and quality control processes to ensure complete and accurate reporting
  of annual improper payment results and formalized risk assessment processes to ensure
  all programs and activities are considered sufficiently to meet PIIA reporting objectives.

  4) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to design and implement enforceable actions and
  controls to hold lenders accountable for not providing all documentation requested
  for loan samples in a timely manner.

  5) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to formally document and implement additional preventative
  and monitoring controls to determine the eligibility of loans prior to loan approval
  and payments and loan guaranty purchases.

  6) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to collaborate with the responsible staff involved
  in the payment integrity reporting process to ensure timely and complete reconciliations
  are performed on the populations subject to sampling for improper payment reviews.

  7) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to exercise effective management review controls
  over the statistician''s work product by verifying that the documentation of the
  sampling and estimation methodology plans comprehensively outlines the implemented
  sampling and extrapolation methodology, while maintaining statistical validity.

  8) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to design and implement effective communication
  and review processes with responsible staff involved in the payment integrity reporting
  process to ensure compliance for the reporting of new programs and activities.

  9) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to design and document adequate review procedures
  to ensure that the results of the sample meet the PIIA objectives.

  10) OIG recommended the Administrator to coordinate with the Associate Administrator
  of the Office of Capital Access to design and implement a formal review process
  to ensure corrective action plans developed, implemented, and published are adequately
  addressing the true root causes of improper and unknown payments.'
