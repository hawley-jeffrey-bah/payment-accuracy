detail_agy1: The SEC conducted its latest improper payments  risk assessment in FY
  2022.  The SEC’s determination that all of its evaluated programs are low risk is
  based upon the results of this assessment, in which none of its programs/activities
  were deemed susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the threshold
  levels set by OMB. These programs have historically had low volumes and risks  of
  improper payments given the controls and processes  in place.

detail_ara2_3: 'The benefits  of recaptured amounts associated with implementing and
  overseeing the program do not exceed the costs— including staff time and payments
  to contractors—of a payment recapture audit program. In making this determination,
  the SEC considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over
  several years.   The SEC also considered whether sophisticated  software and other
  cost-efficient techniques could be used to identify significant overpayments at
  a low cost per overpayment, or if labor intensive manual reviews of paper documentation
  would be required. In addition, the SEC considered the availability of tools to
  efficiently perform the payment recapture audit and  minimize payment recapture
  audit costs.


  The SEC will continue to monitor its improper payments across all programs and activities
  it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each
  program is cost-effective.'

detail_dpa5: The SEC utilizes the Do Not Pay Initiative by evaluating possible improper
  payments flagged by the DNP Portal to ascertain whether flagged payments are actual
  improper payments.  Historically, the agency has had very few improper payments
  and this has continued during FY2022.  After payment has been sent, SEC monitors
  the system once a week to be proactive if DNP marks a payment as possibly improper
  in order to research and refund the payment, if needed.
detail_exs1: 'The SEC assesses its payment integrity in a number of ways each fiscal
  year.

  During FY2022, the agency conducted internal controls activities to assess its financial
  reporting processes including assessment of the strength and accuracy of its payment
  processes.  The agency conducted its tri-annual improper payments risk assessment
  as directed by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).  The results
  of this assessment validated that the SEC''s eight major programs were still at
  low risk for improper payments.  Assessments during the year showed a very low level
  of improper payments and the agency’s processes for self-identification of these
  payments were well developed.

  In addition, during FY2022 the agency underwent the Office of the Inspector General
  (OIG) annual audit, Evaluation of the SEC’s FY 2021 Compliance with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 as required by this legislation.  Based on this
  evaluation, the OIG concluded that the SEC complied with the PIIA in FY 2021 and
  reported efforts to prevent and reduce improper payments.'
