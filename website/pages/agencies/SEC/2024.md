detail_agy1: The SEC conducted its latest full improper payments risk assessment in
  FY 2022 and an additional assessment on one additional program in FY 2023. The SEC’s
  determination that all of its evaluated programs are low risk is based upon the
  results of these assessments, in which none of its programs/activities were deemed
  susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set
  by OMB. These programs have historically had low volumes and risks of improper payments
  given the controls and processes in place.

detail_ara2_3: 'The benefits of recaptured amounts associated with implementing and
  overseeing the program do not exceed the costs— including staff time and payments
  to contractors—of a payment recapture audit program. In making this determination,
  the SEC considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted over
  several years. The SEC also considered whether sophisticated software and other

  cost-efficient techniques could be used to identify significant overpayments at
  a low cost per overpayment, or if labor intensive manual reviews of paper documentation
  would be required. In addition, the SEC considered the availability of tools to
  efficiently perform the payment recapture audit and minimize payment recapture audit
  costs.


  The SEC will continue to monitor its improper payments across all programs and activities
  it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each
  program is cost-effective.'

detail_dpa5: The SEC utilizes the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative by evaluating possible
  improper payments flagged by the DNP Portal to ascertain whether flagged payments
  are actual improper payments. Historically, the agency has had very few improper
  payments, and this has continued during FY2024. After payment has been sent, the
  SEC monitors the system once a week to be proactive if DNP marks a payment as possibly
  improper in order to research and request return of a payment, if needed.
detail_exs1: The SEC assesses its payment integrity in a number of ways each fiscal
  year. During FY2024, the agency conducted internal controls activities to assess
  its financial reporting processes including assessment of the strength and accuracy
  of its payment processes.  Assessments during the year showed a very low level of
  improper payments and the agency’s processes for self-identification of these payments
  were well developed. In addition, during FY2024 the agency underwent the Office
  of the Inspector General (OIG) annual audit which evaluated the SEC’s FY 2023 Compliance
  with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) as required by this legislation.
  Based on this evaluation, the OIG concluded that the SEC complied with the PIIA
  in FY 2023 and reported efforts to prevent and reduce improper payments
