detail_agy1: 'The SEC conducted its latest full improper payments risk assessment
  in FY 2022 and an additional assessment on one additional program in FY 2023. The
  SEC’s determination that all of its evaluated programs are low risk is based upon
  the results of these assessments, in which none of its programs/activities were
  deemed susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the

  threshold levels set by OMB. These programs have historically had low volumes and
  risks of improper payments given the controls and processes in place.'

  to contractors—of a payment recapture audit program.  In making this determination,
  the SEC considered its low improper payment rate based on

  testing conducted over several years. The SEC also considered whether sophisticated
  software and other cost-efficient techniques could be used to identify significant
  overpayments at a low cost per overpayment, or if labor intensive manual reviews
  of paper documentation would be required.  In addition, the SEC considered the availability
  of tools to efficiently perform the payment recapture audit and minimize payment
  recapture audit costs.


  The SEC will continue to monitor its improper payments across all programs and activities
  it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits for each
  program is cost-effective.'

detail_dpa5: 'The SEC utilizes the Do Not Pay Initiative by evaluating possible improper
  payments flagged by the DNP Portal to ascertain whether flagged payments are actual
  improper payments. Historically, the agency has had very few improper payments and
  this has continued during FY2023. After payment has been sent,

  SEC monitors the system once a week to be proactive if DNP marks a payment as possibly
  improper in order to research and refund the payment, if needed.'
detail_exs1: "The SEC assesses its payment integrity in a number of ways each fiscal\
  \ year. \n During FY2023, the agency conducted internal controls activities to assess\
  \ its financial reporting processes including assessment of the strength and accuracy\
  \ of its payment processes.  As directed by the Payment Integrity Information Act\
  \ of 2019 (PIIA), the agency also conducted an improper payments risk assessment\
  \ on one of the programs outside of its triannual risk assessment schedule.  The\
  \ results of this assessment validated as with the SEC's other eight major programs,\
  \ this additional program was at low risk for improper payments. Assessments during\
  \ the year showed a very low level of improper payments and the agency’s processes\
  \ for self-identification of these payments were well developed.  In addition, during\
  \ FY2023 the agency underwent the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) annual audit\
  \ which evaluated the SEC’s FY 2022 Compliance with the Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act of 2019 as required by this legislation. Based on this evaluation, the OIG\
  \ concluded that the SEC complied with the PIIA in FY 2022 and reported efforts\
  \ to prevent and reduce improper payments."

detail_pcp14: The OIG determined through its annual evaluation that the SEC is compliant
  with the Payment Integrity information Act of 2019.  Because the SEC complied with
  the PIIA in FY 2022, the most recent OIG report contains no recommendations.
