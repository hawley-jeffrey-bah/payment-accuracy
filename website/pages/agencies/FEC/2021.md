detail_dpa5: 'We utilize USDA/GSA as our federal shared service provider.  Their response

  By matching the vendor database initially, we ensure our vendor database is good
  and would rarely result in vendor payments that would trigger a match per Do Not
  Pay criteria.  This is possible by the initial approach to ensure our vendor database
  only includes vendors with no triggers for Do Not Pay and by also having the Treasury
  post payment verification, if there is any vendor with a status that has changed,
  it would be caught in the vendor continuous monitoring process or the post payment
  Treasury verification.  '
