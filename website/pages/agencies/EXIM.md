detail_ara2_3: EXIM considered all its programs and activities and determined they
  are not susceptible to making significant improper payments at or above the threshold
  levels set by OMB. By performing recovery audits, the agency will incur costs for
  contractors or other entities to have highly skilled accounting specialists and
  fraud examiners, using state of the art tools and technology, to examine payment
  records and supporting documentation to uncover recoverable payments. Therefore,
  it was determined that is not cost-effective to conduct recovery audits to identify
  and recapture overpayments.

detail_dpa5: EXIM complies with all aspects of the Do Not Pay Initiative through its
  Character, Reputational, and Transaction Integrity (CRTI) process. All transactions
  in the three authorization-based payment programs (Short, Medium, and Long-Term)
  undergo CRTI checks. As a part of CRTI, names of participants are searched within
  a database clearing house of over 20 directories to determine compliance with a
  variety of “Know your Customer” (KYC) and EXIM due-diligence requirements. Also,
  EXIM does not disburse funds directly to payees but through the U.S. Department
  of Treasury Secured Payment System, where any funds disbursed by the Department
  of Treasury go through payment integration in which the Do Not Pay portal automatically
  matches all the files against the Death Master file and the System for Award Management
  (SAM) exclusion records.
detail_exs1: The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requires agencies
  to review and assess all programs and activities they administer and identify those
  determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments. The Office of Management
  and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity
  Improvement, requires that agencies assess all programs with annual outlays greater
  than $10,000,000 for IP risk at least once every three years. The Export-Import
  Bank of the United States (EXIM) supports PIIA and OMB compliance through the activities
  of its Payment Integrity program, which comprises four separate programs, Short-term
  Authorizations, Medium-term Authorizations, Long- term Authorizations, and Cash
  control Disbursements. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years.
  In FY 2024, EXIM was not required to conduct a risk assessment of all four programs,
  as the last risk assessment was conducted in FY 2023.  In FY 2024, it was determined
  that none of its programs were susceptible for making significant improper payments.
