detail_agy1: The Farm Credit Administration performs a 3-year risk assessment of all
  its payment types. Our most recent assessment for data as of Sept. 30, 2023, found
  that we are at low risk for improper payments.

detail_arp18: Given the small size of our agency (total budget of $94.75M for FY2024),
  that we don't have individual programs with outlays over $10M, and our low-risk
  status for improper payments, recovery audits are not cost-effective. Our improper
  payments were only .05% of total outlays for FY2024. We work to recover all identified
  improper payments in conjunction with our service provider. The benefits of any
  recovered amounts would not exceed the cost of a recovery audit program.

detail_dpa5: While the Farm Credit Administration does not use Do Not Pay directly,
  our shared service provider uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to ensure only valid
  vendors are enabled for payment. The use of Do Not Pay by our service provider reduces
  potential improper payments up front in the pre-award and pre-payment phases. For
  pre-award activity, we use the System for Award Management to validate that vendors
  are eligible to do business with the Federal government.
detail_exs1: The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Inspector General (IG) determined
  that the agency is in compliance with the requirements of the Payment Integrity
  Information Act of 2019 for fiscal year (FY) 2023. The IG review for FY 2024 will
  be completed during FY 2025. We do not have any individual programs or activities
  with over $10M in outlays and therefore don't have any programs that are likely
  to be susceptible to significant improper payments. We ensure payment integrity
  through combined efforts with our shared service provider, strong payment controls,
  and continuous monitoring.

detail_pcp14: There were no recommendations from our Office of Inspector General on
