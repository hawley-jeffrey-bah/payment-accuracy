detail_arp18: Given the small size of our agency (total budget of $88.9M for FY2023),
  that we don't have individual programs with outlays over $10M, and our low-risk
  status for improper payments, recovery audits are not cost-effective. Our improper
  payments are only .03% of total outlays for FY2023. We work to recover all identified
  improper payments in conjunction with our service provider. The benefits of any
  recovered amounts would not exceed the cost of a recovery audit program.

detail_dpa5: For pre-award activity, we use the System for Award Management to validate
  valid vendors eligible to do business with the Federal government. While the Farm
  Credit Administration does not use Do Not Pay directly, our shared service provider
  uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to ensure only valid vendors are enabled for payment.
  The use of Do Not Pay by our service provider reduces potential improper payments
  up front in the pre-award and pre-payment phases.
detail_exs1: The Farm Credit Administration does not have any individual programs
  or activities with over $10M in outlays. We perform our assessments on the various
  payment types encountered in our operations. Based on our last risk assessment for
  the period ended Sept. 30, 2020, we determined that our programs and activities
  are low risk and are not susceptible to significant improper payments. We will complete
  the next assessment in FY 2024 for the period ended Sept. 30, 2023.
