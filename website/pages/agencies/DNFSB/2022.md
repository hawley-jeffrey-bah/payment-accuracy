  the requirements for publishing and posting the annual financial statement and accompanying
  materials required under the PIIA and corresponding OMB guidance. At the same time,
  the OIG did not report any material weaknesses in internal control.  DNFSB has taken
  action to remediate these findings.

detail_exs1: "The OIG reviewed DNFSB compliance with the Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act (PIIA) and determined that DNFISB is in compliant with the following:\n\n\
  -Conducted Improper Payment (IP) risk assessments for each program with\nannual\
  \ outlays greater than $10,000,000 at least once in the last three years\n-Adequately\
  \ concluded whether the program is likely to make IPs and\nUnknown Payments (UP)\
  \ above or below the statutory threshold\n\nHowever, OIG concluded that DNFSB is\
  \ not in compliance with including PIIA information in its Agency Financial Report\
  \ and the agency website. \n\nDNFSB has taken corrective actions to remediate these\
  \ findings. \n"
