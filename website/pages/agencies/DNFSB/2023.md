detail_exs1: "DNFSB conducts periodic review of all programs and activities to identify\
  \ those that may be susceptible to improper payments. In FY2023, DNFSB performed\
  \ a risk assessment of outlays exceeding $10 million, based on OMB guidance M-21-19,\
  \ annual Improper Payment (IP) or Unknown Payment (UP) above $10,000,000 and 1.5%\
  \ of the program's total annual outlays are considered to be above the statutory\
  \ threshold. As a result, the overall DNFSB risk score is low, below the statutory\
  \ threshold, and is deemed not susceptible to improper payments; comprehensive risk\
  \ assessments are not required for any DNFSB programs.\n\nThroughout the year, DNFSB\
  \ maintains payment integrity by executing internal controls over each payment to\
  \ mitigate any risk of improper payment and prevent fraud, waste and abuse.  \n\n\
  In FY2023, the OIG reviewed DNFSB’s Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) program,\
  \ and concluded the agency is compliant with all the applicable OMB Compliance Requirements\
  \ listed below:\n-Published Payment Integrity Information Act with the Agency Financial\
  \ Report.\n-Posted the Agency Financial Report and accompanying materials on the\
  \ agency website.\n-Conducted IP risk assessments for each program with annual outlays\
