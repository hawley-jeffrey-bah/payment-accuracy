detail_agy1: 'The Peace Corps is a small agency operating under one program, with
  no activities that are susceptible to the threshold amounts for significant improper
  payments (OMB, M-15-02).  Significant improper payments are defined as gross annual
  improper payments exceeding 1.5% of all activity disbursements made during the fiscal
  year reported, whereas, in Peace Corps our improper payments were only 0.04% of
  our total agency FY22 outlays.

  The Peace Corps performs a combination of invoice review, post-audit verification,
  and sampling to ensure improper payments are prevented, identified, and recovered
  whenever feasible.'
detail_ara1: 'Yes'
detail_ara2: 'Yes'
detail_ara2_1: Bills of collection, offset of future payments, Treasury CRS
detail_ara2_2: The cost of recovery outweighs the amount to be recovered. The time
  elapsed between occurrence and discovery is often too great and with high staff
  turnover the ability to recover funds through external measures takes longer and
  is not fully effective.

  performs a combination of invoice review, post-audit verification, and sampling
  to ensure improper payments are prevented, identified, and recovered, if feasible.
  In FY 2022, an assessment of the likelihood of improper payments for disbursements
  was conducted and data evaluated. Our agency is not susceptible to significant improper
  payments.
