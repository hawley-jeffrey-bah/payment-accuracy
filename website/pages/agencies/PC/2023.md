detail_agy1: Peace Corps is a small agency operating under one program, with no activities
  that are susceptible to the threshold limits for significant improper payments exceeding
  1.5% of all activity disbursements made during the fiscal year reported. The improper
  payments were 0.055% of our total agency FY23 outlays. Our agency performs a combination
  of invoice review, post-audit verification, and sampling to ensure improper payments
  are prevented, identified, and recovered whenever feasible. Our recovery rate in
  FY23 was 93%.

detail_ara2_3: "In general, the agency does not make large payments that would be\
  \ considered high risk (block grants, cost reimbursable contracts, payments in advance\
  \ of performance, mandatory benefits payments). \n\nAdditionally, Peace Corps performs\
  \ extensive advance certification reviews on any payments in excess of $2500 as\
  \ well as post payment audits of disbursements on a continuous basis. These preventative\
  \ and recovery activities are an effective and efficient way of identifying the\
  \ limited instances of overpayments. Conducting a formal recovery audit is not deemed\
  \ to be cost-effective."

detail_exs1: 'As an agency in Phase 1 without programs in Phase 2, the Peace Corps
  performs a combination of invoice review, post-audit verification, and sampling
  to ensure improper payments are prevented, identified, and recovered, if feasible.
  In FY 2023, an assessment was conducted, and data evaluated. Our agency is not susceptible
  to significant improper payments.

detail_pcp14: PC OIG recommended that the Chief Financial Officer implement a process
  for reviewing bills of collections issued by overseas posts and other collections
  from third parties to determine if the relevant payments made met the criteria for
  “improper or unknown payments” per PIIA guidance. This recommendation was fully
  implemented in FY23.
