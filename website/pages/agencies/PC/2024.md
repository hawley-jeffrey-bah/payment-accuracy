  \ considered high risk (block grants, cost reimbursable contracts, payments in advance\
  \ of performance, mandatory benefits payments). \n\nAdditionally, Peace Corps performs\
  \ extensive advance certification reviews on any payments in excess of $2500 as\
  \ well as Post payment audits of disbursements on a continuous basis. \n\nThese\
  \ preventative and recovery activities are an effective and efficient way of identifying\
  \ the limited instances of overpayments. Conducting a formal recovery audit would\

detail_exs1: "Peace Corps is a small agency operating under one program. Peace Corps\
  \ does not have activities that are susceptible to the threshold limits for significant\
  \ improper payments exceeding 1.5% of all activity disbursements made during the\
  \ fiscal year reported. The improper payments were 0.108% of our total agency FY24\
  \ outlays. \n\nPeace Corps performs a combination of invoice review, post-audit\
  \ verification, and sampling to ensure improper payments are prevented, identified,\
  \ and recovered whenever feasible. Peace Corps' recovery rate in FY24 was 57.78%.\n\
  \nPeace Corps certifying officers review all invoices USDE 2,500 and above and perform\
  \ weekly reviews of sampled invoices (5%) below USDE 2500 for disbursements and\
  \ monthly review of all purchase card transactions. \n\nAny payments identified\
  \ as improper are logged and monitored quarterly for recovery steps. Follow up continues\
  \ until recovery is complete. If recovery is not possible, Peace Corps engages with\
  \ Treasury CRS to assist if internal efforts are unsuccessful. \n\nAs a last resort,\
  \ Peace Corps writes off debts that are deemed uncollectable or not in the best\
  \ interest of the agency."

detail_pcp14: "Results:\nOur review determined that the Peace Corps complied with\
  \ PIIA for fiscal year (FY) 2023. \n\nWe analyzed the agency’s estimate of improper\
  \ and unknown payments and risk assessment for FY 2023 and found that the agency\
  \ managed its financial information in accordance with PIIA requirements. The agency\
  \ also provided payment integrity information through Office of Management and Budget’s\
  \ (OMB) FY 2023 annual data call; published its improper payment information in\
  \ the AFR for FY 2023; and posted that report on the Peace Corps’ website.\n\nBased\
  \ on the results of our review, we concluded that it is unlikely that the Peace\
  \ Corps reached the significant improper or unknown payment threshold.2 We noted\
  \ that the dollar values of the individual payments are considerably lower than\
  \ the significant improper payment threshold \namounts. \n\nWe did not identify\
  \ any significant improper payments that met or exceeded the PIIA-established threshold\
  \ in our FY 2023 audits, the audit of the agency’s FY 2023 financial statements,\
  \ or other \naudits or reviews conducted during FY 2023."
