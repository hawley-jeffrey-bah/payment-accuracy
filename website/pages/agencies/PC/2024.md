detail_ara2_3: "In general, the agency does not make large payments that would be\
  \ considered high risk (block grants, cost reimbursable contracts, payments in advance\
  \ of performance, mandatory benefits payments). \n\nAdditionally, Peace Corps performs\
  \ extensive advance certification reviews on any payments in excess of $2500 as\
  \ well as Post payment audits of disbursements on a continuous basis. \n\nThese\
  \ preventative and recovery activities are an effective and efficient way of identifying\
  \ the limited instances of overpayments. Conducting a formal recovery audit would\
  \ not be cost-effective."

detail_exs1: "Peace Corps is a small agency operating under one program. Peace Corps\
  \ does not have activities that are susceptible to the threshold limits for significant\
  \ improper payments exceeding 1.5% of all activity disbursements made during the\
  \ fiscal year reported. The improper payments were 0.108% of our total agency FY24\
  \ outlays. \n\nPeace Corps performs a combination of invoice review, post-audit\
  \ verification, and sampling to ensure improper payments are prevented, identified,\
  \ and recovered whenever feasible. Peace Corps' recovery rate in FY24 was 57.78%.\n\
  \nPeace Corps certifying officers review all invoices USDE 2,500 and above and perform\
  \ weekly reviews of sampled invoices (5%) below USDE 2500 for disbursements and\
  \ monthly review of all purchase card transactions. \n\nAny payments identified\
  \ as improper are logged and monitored quarterly for recovery steps. Follow up continues\
  \ until recovery is complete. If recovery is not possible, Peace Corps engages with\
  \ Treasury CRS to assist if internal efforts are unsuccessful. \n\nAs a last resort,\
  \ Peace Corps writes off debts that are deemed uncollectable or not in the best\
  \ interest of the agency."
