detail_CAP5: 'It was recommended that EEOC implement agency-wide Improper Payment
  Risk Assessment Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) based on OMB A-123 Appendix
  C guidance and identify a responsible point of contact for each significant program.
  The responsible party should report results of their risk assessment to the EEOC
  responsible official.   It was also recommended to implement an SOP to ensure annual
  compliance with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements.   The agency developed
  and implemented an agency-wide PIIA policy on December 28, 2023, to address compliance
  with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements and risk assessment procedures.  The
  agency has also conducted an Improper Payment risk assessment of the Pay and Benefits
  (Payroll) Program and concluded that the Pay and Benefits (Payroll) Program is not
  susceptible to significant improper payments or unknown payments.  The agency will
  also report the results of the Pay and Benefits risk assessment in the agency''s
  financial report.

detail_cap4: 'In a performance agreement for the official, incentives and consequences
  are meant to be aligned with the official''s efforts to enhance payment accuracy,
  prevent fraud, and bring the agency into compliance. Incentives may include financial
  rewards, recognition, and access to additional training and development opportunities
  to enhance skills and expertise. Conversely, consequences may include being held
  accountable for any significant lapses in payment integrity due to gross negligence,
  reputational impact which might affect their future career prospects, and legal
  consequences for the agency. Effective performance agreements create a strong incentive
  for the official(s) to diligently work toward improving payment accuracy and preventing
  fraud, as their professional advancement and reputation, as well as the reputation
  of the agency, are directly affected by their ability to meet these goals.

  EEOC is cross-serviced by the Department of Interior, Interior Business Center (DOI/IBC)
  for accounting system support and accounts payable processing.  As a result, the
  implementation of the DNP initiative is a joint responsibility between the EEOC
  and IBC. Prior to making a new contract award, the EEOC utilizes the System for
  Award Management (SAM) to see if the vendor is excluded from receiving contracts.
  If SAM does not list any exclusions, the EEOC submits a new vendor request to IBC.
  The IBC Vendor Maintenance Team verifies EEOC’s entire new employee and Non-Federal
  Vendor requests against the Department of Treasury’s DNP database and if the IBC
  Vendor Maintenance Team finds a positive match, they notify the EEOC. The EEOC reviews
  the match, determines if the payment is proper, and reports the result.
