Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Civilian Pay – Army
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Currently there are no known barriers for the Army's Civilian Pay Payment
      Integrity program.  The improper payment errors for the Army were caused by
      payments received from improperly signed Standard Forms (SF) 1190, “Foreign
      Allowances Application, Grant and Report” that are required to authorize the
      payment(s) for submission into the payroll system for processing.  The employees
      were all entitled to receive the payments; however, because the SF1190 was not
      signed by all required parties, the payment was improper.
    Info: The travel orders document the employee is located in a foreign area and
      entitled to receive overseas entitlement payments.  Travel Orders are submitted
      at the time the SF1190 is submitted to HR for processing to the HR system.  The
      program is unable to conclude if the payment is proper because HR can’t validate
      the employee was located in the proper foreign area without the Travel Orders.  The
      location needs to be validated with the Travel Orders.  The Travel Orders detail
      the location of the employee in a foreign area and authorizes the payment.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: "For the DoD Education Activity (DoDEA) DoDEA Allowance Processing System\
      \ (DAPS) (SF1190) and the Travel Order Processing System (TOPS)(DD1614), a DoDEA\
      \ employee must complete an SF1190 to apply for authorization and payment for\
      \ overseas allowances.  The DoDEA employee must also complete an DD-1614 to\
      \ apply for Non-TDY Travel. \n\nCompletion of the SF-1190 and the DD-1614 provides\
      \ the necessary information to determine the correct amount for all overseas\
      \ and travel allowances.  DAPS and TOPS are older systems that do not have the\
      \ ability to provide Common Access Card (CAC) signatures.  However, DAPS and\
      \ TOPS are DoDEA systems that have official signature cards on file and can\
      \ only be accessed with appropriate vetted access and a CAC.  It is important\
      \ to note that DoDEA employees are being paid correctly and this is just a supporting\
      \ documentation control finding.\n\nDAPS and TOPS are to be modernized in the\
      \ coming years and will provide the capability to have CAC signatures on the\
      \ SF1190 and DD1614.\n"
    Info: The Department's Other Defense Organization Civilian Pay Payment Integrity
      program Address/Location eligibility criteria is based primarily missing key
      supporting documentation and/or documentation that is not properly signed in
      accordance with applicable requirements.  These improper and unknown payments
      are attributed to specific documentation that is a result of the incorrect Foreign
      Post Allowance and Differential being applied incorrectly for the civilian employee.
      Additionally, underpayments and overpayments were attributed to incorrect salary
      calculation, geographic location, miscalculated Cost of Living Allowance rates
      and Living Quarters Allowance.

- Program_Name: Commercial Pay – Mechanization of Contract Administration Services
    (MOCAS)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The Department’s MOCAS Commercial pay program utilizes the Treasury’s
      Do Not Pay system. One specific barrier is going past the eligibility of the
      System of Award (SAM) contract module that tests of authorized vendors. If it
      was possible to test the contract specific line-item eligibility that would
      increase the potential to reduce the likelihood of reducing improper and unknown
      payments. The specific contracts terms for each payment are also reviewed to
      determine the dollar amount the contactor is eligible to receive upon meeting
      the terms of the contract.  When contract terms are not properly entered in
      the payment system the likelihood of improper payments is increased.  If it
      was possible to ensure all contract terms are electronically interfaced to prevent
      missing information used to determine a contractor’s eligibility for payment,
      it would reduce improper and unknown payments.  Further, the Department mitigates
      this risk by utilizing the Advana improper payment tool as the prepayment resource,
      which detects potential improper payments until a subsequent review has been
      conducted to confirm whether the proposed payment is proper.
    Info: The Department’s Commercial Pay - MOCAS program PIIA objectives target the
      Commercial Pay vendors who deliver the goods or perform the services to ensure
      payment accuracy. The Contractor of Provider Status eligibility OMB theme is
      the closest aligned theme that pertains to the Department’s Commercial Pay -
      MOCAS program. Based on contractual law, the eligibility barriers are not usually
      relevant if the vendor performed in accordance with their contract from a payment
      perspective, because they are owed the compensation for either delivering the
      goods or performing the service. This also applies to debarment where a vendor
      may be debarred but could be the only source for the Department requirements,
      which will supersede and allow that specific contractor or vendor to have and
      to perform the contract accordingly.

- Program_Name: Military Pay Army – National Guard
  Themes:
  - Barriers: There is a potential for document retention and acquisition problems
      in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for the Army
      National Guard Military (ARNG) Pay program dependency criteria. To further mitigate
      the risk of dependency related improper and unknown payment errors, the ARNG
      has provided and will continue to provide virtual training to the 50 States,
      Territories and the District of Columbia with over 200 attendees participating
      monthly. These trainings have been instrumental in the overall reduction of
      error rates from fiscal years (FY) 2023 to 2024.  Additionally, ARNG in conjunction
      with the US Army Reserve will start a Military pay certification program in
      quarter two of FY 2025 to provide baseline Military pay training to new state
      pay technicians.
    Info: Army National Guard Military (ARNG) Pay dependency criteria is aligned to
      the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR). Specifically,
      DoD FMR Volume 7A Chapter 26, "Housing Allowances" and DoD FMR Volume 7A 27,
      "Family Separation Allowance (FSA)." The majority of the sampled improper and
      unknown payments were attributed to dependency errors where the key supporting
      documentation to properly substantiate the ARNG dependents was missing or incorrectly
      signed.  For example the DA Form 5960, "Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH) Authorization
      And Dependency Declaration," which is a required form for the BAH entitlement,
      was not signed correctly and/or not made readily available for the review period.
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: There is a potential for document retention and acquisition problems
      in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for the Military
      status criteria for the Military Pay - Army National Guard (ARNG) program. To
      further mitigate the risk of Military status eligibility related improper and
      unknown payment errors, the ARNG has provided and will continue to provide virtual
      training to the 50 States, Territories and the District of Columbia with over
      200 attendees participating monthly. These trainings have been instrumental
      in the overall reduction of our error rates from fiscal years (FY) 2023 to 2024.  Additionally,
      ARNG in conjunction with the US Army Reserve will start a Military pay certification
      program in quarter two of FY 2025 to provide baseline Military pay training
      to new state pay technicians.
    Info: The Military status eligibility for the Military Pay - Army National Guard
      program is determined by the service member's order issuing authority. The errors
      identified were based on the basic pay entitlement, which is determined by the
      validity of orders that cover the period of the entitlement. To continue to
      resolve the error, further research is being conducted to obtain the proper
      order to determine the validity of the entitlement.

- Program_Name: Travel Pay Army – Defense Travel System (DTS)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The main causes of improper and unknown payments within the travel pay
      program are missing or invalid receipts, miscalculation of reimbursement amount
      (e.g. per diem, mileage, etc.), and reimbursement for unauthorized travel expenses
      (e.g. laundry, excess baggage, rental car fuel, mail, etc.). As these are not
      available categories in the questionnaire, "address/location" was selected because
      they occurred while on official government travel outside their assigned duty
      location. Decentralization of the travel pay program and inadequate review and
      approval process on source documentation. Lack the understanding of Department
      of Defense regulations, guides, and manuals and non-enforcement of accountability.
      Travelers and approving officials not understanding official travel requirements
      or failing to comply with official travel requirements.
    Info: 'The main causes of improper and unknown payments within the Travel Pay
      Army program are (1) missing or invalid receipts, (2) miscalculation of reimbursement
      amount (e.g. per diem, mileage, etc.), and (3) reimbursement for unauthorized
      travel expenses (e.g. laundry, excess baggage, rental car fuel, mail, etc.).
      As these are not available categories in the questionnaire, "address/location"
      was selected because they occurred while on official government travel outside
      their assigned duty location.


      Vendor receipts are required to evidence official travel expenses were incurred.
      Reviewing and approving officials were not ensuring that travelers provide valid
      documentations for authorized expenses for the performance of official travel,
      and the rules for paying appropriate meal rates when authorized to procure commercial
      meals instead of using a government dining facility. Organizations did not comply
      with travel orders regulation and the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) when travelers
      were directed to perform travel before the issuance of actual travel orders.'

- Program_Name: Travel Pay Department of Air Force (DAF) – Defense Travel System (DTS)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The Department of the Air Force (DAF) Defense Travel System (DTS) vouchers
      are ultimately the DAF’s responsibility, control . There is a known lack of
      internal control associated with DTS itself which lends to an increase in improper
      payments.  DTS does not have any internal systematic controls over the application
      of permission levels within the system.  Therefore, anyone with a specific permission
      level to include Approving Official (AO) may grant anyone else the same permission
      level.  Unfortunately, this means there are AOs in the system approving improper
      payments who have not been appropriately appointed and trained to perform the
      duty.  The DAF created a BOT to cross-check all AOs who have been properly appointed
      on a DD Form 577 and have completed the required training, then it removes all
      AOs who are not in compliance.
    Info: For Department of the Air Force Defense Travel System payments, the location
      must be correctly identified to determine per diem authorizations for travel.  The
      proper location and address on the supporting documentation is critical for
      proper payments.

detail_CAP5: 'The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) evaluated the compliance of
  the DoD’s 16 programs with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).
  The audit for fiscal year (FY) 2023 revealed that eight Phase 1 programs successfully
  met the PIIA requirements. It also found that the eight Phase 2 programs were compliant
  with only five out of the six PIIA requirements.  On the sixth requirement, the
  DoD IG found the Department lacked an adequate methodology to ascertain the completeness
  of the DoD’s universe of transactions. Consequently, the Department was unable to
  publish reliable estimates.


  To address this, the Department is adopting two strategic paths to achieve PIIA
  compliance, incorporating the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123,
  Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches.
  These phases are not necessarily sequential or obligatory. A program can achieve
  and maintain PIIA compliance in either phase. This is accomplished by implementing
  corrective actions aimed at reducing both improper payments and unknown payments.
  The goal is to bring these payment rates below the PIIA statutory threshold or to
  a tolerable level.


  Path 1: Risk Assessments for PIIA Compliance (Phase 1)


  This path involves conducting comprehensive risk assessments on unique data characteristics
  and subpopulation groups. These groups are not expected to be susceptible to significant
  improper and unknown payments due to their internal controls designed to mitigate
  risk. In FY 2024, we restructured the department’s entire Payment Integrity portfolio
  based on the results and recommendations from the DoD OIG’s previous audits and
  interagency lessons learned.


  Path 2: Sampling & Estimation for PIIA Compliance (Phase 2)


  This path targets programs anticipated to exceed the OMB statutory threshold and
  likely to have significant improper and unknown payments. In FY 2023, the DoD OIG
  found that the Department produced unreliable improper payment and unknown payment
  estimates for the 13th consecutive year. Despite having statistically valid sampling
  plans, the Phase 2 programs failed due to the unsubstantiated payment population
  used to create the test samples.


  To rectify these deficiencies, the Department will establish a Payment Integrity
  Universe of Transactions (UoT) working group. This group aims to report reliable
  estimates by the FY 2025 reporting cycle, which will include a complete and reconciled
  payment population along with the previous valid sampling methodology. The working
  group’s goal is to develop and implement a standardized process to identify each
  program’s UoT population data characteristics, validate the completeness of the
  UoT payment population, and produce reliable improper and unknown payment estimates.

  program is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department
  of Defense (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously
  demonstrating financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists
  of a combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components,
  PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries performed by TRICARE private sector contractors.
  The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken by DoD Components
  with additional collection activities performed by the Defense Finance and Accounting
  Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.

  to identify overpayments. It is through this system of internal controls surrounding
  the payments that assists in resolving the erroneous non-intentional monetary loss
  of Department dollars. The Department also utilizes collaborative working groups
  and enhanced specific reports that are disseminated to the responsible DoD Component
  for the identification, validation, and potential corrective actions for the trends

  (issued by the Defense Health Agency; Commercial Pay (issued by the Defense Finance
  and Accounting Service (DFAS)); and USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) Commercial
  Pay (issued by USACE), comprising the majority of the payments issued by the Department.
  Retirement & Annuitant Pay (issued by DFAS) is currently in the process of enrolling
  into DNP with the anticipated implementation in fiscal year 2024. Amongst the three
  DoD agencies currently enrolled in DNP, the Department uses the online search, payment
  integration, and batch matching features of DNP on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
  The majority of the flagged payees are based on the Death Master File and the name
  match results from the rest of the DNP databases (e.g., System for Award Management).
  The Department researches all payments that are identified to be potentially improper.


  Research has determined that the majority of these match results are false positives
  (e.g., a vendor’s tax identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s
  social security number, and the payment is erroneously flagged). The remaining matches
  are almost always deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts
  terms and vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed
  properly under contractual agreements). The Department has historically adjudicated
  and deemed proper all potential improper payments identified using the DNP Portal.
  To date, the DNP initiative has not reduced the Department’s improper payments.'
detail_exs1: "The Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) met the overarching\
  \ intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management\
  \ and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C.  Payment Integrity has been a top\
  \ management priority, with the development of effective methodologies to identify,\
  \ prevent, and recover improper payments. \n\nIn the fiscal year (FY) 2023 PIIA\
  \ compliance audit, the Department successfully met five out of six compliance criteria.\
  \  To achieve full PIIA compliance, the Department has adopted two strategic paths,\
  \ incorporating the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and\
  \ Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches. \n\nIn FY 2024, the Department restructured\
  \ its entire Payment Integrity portfolio, integrating the results and recommendations\
  \ from the DoD Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) previous audit findings and interagency\
  \ lessons learned.  The aim was to bring improper payment (IP) and unknown payment\
  \ (UP) rates below the PIIA statutory threshold.  The Department established these\
  \ Payment Integrity programs to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Payment Integrity\
  \ reporting while streamlining Department resources and striving towards achieving\
  \ compliance with the PIIA and OMB guidance. \n\nThe Department’s current payment\
  \ integrity portfolio consists of 48 separate programs, including 42 Phase 1 programs\
  \ and six Phase 2 programs.  In FY 2023, three Phase 1 programs completed their\
  \ risk assessments and achieved PIIA compliance, moving them to a three-year cycle.\
  \  In FY 2024, 20 programs completed improper payment risk assessments and determined\
  \ that they were not likely to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown\
  \ payments.  The Department aims to complete risk assessments for the remaining\
  \ 19 programs in FY 2025.  By identifying low-risk programs and placing them in\
  \ Phase 1 reporting, the Department can allocate resources more efficiently and\
  \ focus on high-risk Phase 2 programs. \n\nIn FY 2024, the Department’s six Phase\
  \ 2 programs identified $256.0 billion in payments or outlays subject to testing\
  \ under the PIIA and estimated a proper payment rate of 99.58 percent ($255.9 billion).\
  \  The IP rate was approximately 0.25 percent ($635.3 million), and the UP rate\
  \ was approximately 0.17 percent ($451.4 million).  The Department employed a statistical\
  \ methodology recommended by the DoD OIG to develop these FY 2024 IP and UP results,\
  \ which tested more high-risk payment samples.  The overarching goal is to achieve\
  \ PIIA compliance, specifically compliance criteria #3, by publishing IP and UP\
  \ estimates for programs susceptible to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying\
  \ materials to the annual financial statement.  \n\nThe Department prevented all\
  \ the Phase 2 programs from becoming a high priority program in FY 2024 through\
  \ its continued efforts to identify error root causes, focus on controls that detect\
  \ and prevent overpayments, implement or reinforce applicable processes and procedures,\
  \ and train staff on policy guidance and best practices.\n\nThe Department has dedicated\
  \ considerable effort to identifying and recovering $1,827.4 million in monetary\

detail_raa9: 'The Department conducts comprehensive risk assessments on unique data
  characteristics and subpopulation groups.  Most of these groups are not expected
  to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments due to the strength
  of their internal controls which mitigate risk.  Programs deemed susceptible to
  significant improper and unknown payments must transition to Phase 2.


  Actions were initiated in FY 2022 and built upon in FY 2023 through the successful
  restructuring of the Defense Health Agency Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The
  restructuring involved dividing the large Military Health Benefits program into
  six smaller, more manageable programs.  This strategic division allowed the Department
  to concentrate on the unique risks and controls associated with each program.  As
  a result of the restructure and targeted focus on program-specific risk factors
  and mitigating controls, the Department achieved PIIA compliance for the first time
  in the Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The Department then examined all programs
  to understand the correlation between individual subgroup error rates and their
  combined program error rates.  The Department found that robust internal control
  processes directly contributed to the individual program’s lower projected improper
  and unknown payment rates.  The Department-wide efforts in FY 2024 were focused
  on performing comprehensive risk assessments to document, identify, and classify
  the inherent risks and mitigating factors of payment types. As such, the Department
  leveraged this reorganization (16 total programs in FY 2023; 8 Phase 1 and 8 Phase
  2 to 42 Phase 1 and 6 Phase 2 programs in FY 2024) to develop and implement appropriate
  internal controls to reduce improper and unknown payments and uphold financial stewardship
  of taxpayer money. This strategy aligns with the OMB’s Joint Financial Management
  Improvement Program and demonstrates that PIIA compliance is achievable through
  the Department’s current internal control environment.
