  Themes:
  - Barriers: Travel Order Processing System and DoDEA Allowance Processing System
      are cold fusion applications. It has been increasingly difficult for the DoDEA
      programmers to make changes to these systems as the digital code which they
      are written in does not conform to current DoD changes nor new technology requirements
      such as a CAC-enabled signature. The DoDEA is undergoing system modernization
      for both systems.
    Info: 'The Department''s Civilian Pay Payment Integrity program Address/Location

      eligibility criteria is a result of the incorrect Foreign Post Allowance and
      Differential being applied incorrectly for the civilian employee. Additionally,
      underpayments and overpayments were attributed to incorrect salary calculation
      or geographic location and miscalculated Cost of Living Allowance rates.'
    Theme: Address/Location
  - Barriers: There are no known Department's Civilian Pay Payment Integrity program
      Employment eligibility related barriers prohibiting improving prevention of
      improper payments
    Info: 'The Department''s Civilian Pay Payment Integrity program Employment

      eligibility criteria was attributed primarily to Recruitment Incentive, salary
      and subsistence  overpayments.'
    Theme: Employment
- Program_Name: Commercial Pay
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The Department’s Commercial pay program utilizes the Treasury’s Do
      Not Pay

      system. One specific barrier is going past the eligibility of the System of
      Award (SAM) contract module that tests of authorized vendors. If it was possible
      to test the contract specific line-item eligibility that would increase the
      potential to reduce the likelihood of reducing improper and unknown payments.
      The

      Department mitigates this risk by utilizing the Advana improper payment tool
      as the prepayment resource, which detects potential improper payments until
      a subsequent review has been conducted to confirm whether the proposed payment
      is proper.'
    Info: The Department’s Commercial pay program PIIA objectives target the Commercial
      Pay vendors who deliver the goods or perform the services to ensure payment
      accuracy. The Contractor of Provider Status eligibility OMB theme is the closest
      aligned theme that pertains to the Department’s Commercial pay program. Based
      on contractual law, the eligibility barriers are not usually relevant if the
      vendor performed in accordance with their contract from a payment perspective,
      because they are owed the compensation for either delivering the goods or performing
      the service. This also applies to debarment where a vendor may be debarred but
      could be the only source for the Department requirements, which will supersede
      and allow that specific contractor or vendor to have and to perform the contract
      accordingly.

- Program_Name: DoD Travel Pay
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The main causes of improper and unknown payments within the travel
      pay program are missing or invalid receipts, miscalculation of reimbursement
      amount (e.g. per diem, mileage, etc.), and reimbursement for unauthorized travel
      expenses (e.g. laundry, excess baggage, rental car fuel, mail, etc.). As these
      are not available categories in the questionnaire, "address/location" was selected
      because they occurred while on official government travel outside their assigned
      duty location.


      Decentralization of the travel pay program and inadequate review and approval
      process on source documentation.  Lack the understanding of Department of Defense
      regulations, guides, and manuals and non-enforcement of accountability.  Travelers
      and approving officials not understanding official travel requirements or failing
      to comply with official travel requirements.'
    Info: 'The main causes of improper and unknown payments within the travel pay

      Vendor receipts are required to evidence official travel expenses were incurred.  Reviewing
      and approving officials were not ensuring that travelers provide valid documentations
      for authorized expenses for the performance of official travel, and the rules
      for paying appropriate meal rates when authorized to procure commercial meals
      instead of using a government dining facility.  Organizations did not comply
      with travel orders regulation and the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) when travelers
      were directed to perform travel before the issuance of actual travel orders.'
    Theme: Address/Location
- Program_Name: Military Pay - Army
  Themes:
  - Barriers: There is a potential for document retention and acquisition problems
      in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) with the Army
      Commands.
    Info: 'In collaboration with the Army Military Personnel Division (MPD), Installation

      Management Command, Army G-1, Human Resource Directorate, the dependency validation
      process based upon reassignment or separation is coordinated efforts between
      the MPD, the EFMP Program Manager, and the Overseas Family Travel Office. Applicable
      orders identify dependency status from the MPD authentication within the Defense
      Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. The orders are used to update the finance
      record as well. This process solidifies dependency eligibility between the Army
      personnel and finance records.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: There are not current barriers to prohibit improving the reduction of
      improper payments based off of Military Status.
    Info: 'The Army Military status eligibility for active, national guard, and reserve

      components are basically determined by their order issuing authority. The errors
      identified based upon the entitlement of basic pay is determined by the validity
      of orders that cover the period of the entitlement (i.e. basic pay). To continue
      to resolve the error, further research is being conducted to obtain the proper
      order to determine the validity of the entitlement.'
    Theme: Military Status
- Program_Name: Military Pay - Department of Air Force
  Themes:
  - Barriers: There were no known barriers identified during the post-pay review process
      that prohibit the improvement or prevention of the Military Pay - Department
      of the Air Force program's ability to match data with the Address/Location of
      the eligibility theme criteria. The Department believes these two underpayments
      and one overpayment are not indicative of a larger problem.
    Info: The Department's Military Pay - Department of Air Force (DAF) program had
      two underpayment and one overpayment samples out of 2,412 samples that were
      attributed to over and underpayments based on the Address/Location eligibility
      criteria. For the two underpayment samples, the DAF Servicemembers were underpaid
      a combined total of $159.50 for their Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) with
      Dependents. Conversely for the one overpayment equaled $100.50 for a DAF Servicemember
      was not authorized  BAH with Dependents.
    Theme: Address/Location
  - Barriers: The Department of Air Force (DAF) has identified document retention
      as sometimes a barrier to improving the prevention of improper payments. Ensuring
      documents are properly stored in accordance with the various regulations and
      policy guidance is critical and is continuously being improved. In two overpayment
      cases on one sample, the DAF Servicemember graduated early per the modified
      orders, resulting in minor overpayments with a combined total of $174.04. In
      the other overpayment sample attributed to Military Status as the eligibility
      theme is a DAF Servicemember with Foreign Language Proficiency Pay had documentation
      to prove the eligibility after the review period to substantiate the payment.
    Info: The Department's Military Pay- Department of Air Force (DAF) program comprises
      of the salary, benefits, and other compensation entitlements for Active and
      Reserve Military Service members that belong to the Air Force and Space Force.
      Additionally, Military Status Eligibility is determined by the enlistment/commissioning
      documents and the member’s orders (Entry to Active Duty (EAD), Permanent Change
      of Station (PCS) and Temporary Duty (TDY)). They could be various factors affecting
      their status like leave documents, confinement, absent without official leave
      (AWOL), hospitalization, PCS, TDY, etc. Each of the documents could affect the
      member’s status and therefore affecting their entitlements.
    Theme: Military Status
- Program_Name: Military Pay - Navy
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Given the extremely low instances in address/location errors (two errors
      found in the 2,099 samples), there are no known barriers preventing Navy’s Military
      Pay Program from continuing to achieve extremely low rates for this error type.
    Info: The Department's Military Pay - Navy program had two overpayment and zero
      underpayment samples out of 2,099 samples that were attributed to overpayments
      based on the Address/Location eligibility criteria. For both samples, the Navy
      Servicemembers were paid a combined total of $74.40 overpayment for their Basic
      Allowance for Housing due to incorrect zip code.
    Theme: Address/Location
  - Barriers: No known barriers – the US Navy had an extremely low number of errors.
      Incorrect calculations occurred due to pay attribute discrepancies between systems
      (NSIPS and DJMS-RC) at time of payment (Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD), Rank/Rate,
      and Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH).
    Info: Department's Military Pay- Navy program eligibility criteria is based on
      rank, dependent status, and duty locations.

- Program_Name: Military Retirement
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The human error aspect is still present. Even if data received from
      the Military Branches is fully accurate, there is no guarantee a processing
      error or data entry error will not occur.
    Info: 'Information necessary to properly process retired and annuity accounts
      can

      include Military Status criteria such as service status and service connection.
      Retirement orders and applications are essential to processing a retiree’s pay
      correctly. Similarly for annuitants, when the retiree’s account is accurate,
      this helps to ensure the accuracy of annuity pay upon establishment.'

  to identify overpayments. It is through this system of internal controls surrounding
  the payments that assists in resolving the erroneous non-intentional monetary loss

  \ Accessibility audit, self assessment program, and focus metrics program.\n\nThe\
  \ Department’s Civilian Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation\
  \ related entitlements for Department Civilians. The Civilian Pay process is dependent\
  \ upon the built in internal controls for accuracy and timely distribution. The\
  \ Department has an internal control structure in place for\ntesting time and attendance\
  \ that provides reasonable assurance that the hours worked, hours in pay status,\
  \ and hours absent are properly recorded.\n\nThe DoD Travel Pay PRA program incorporates\
  \ all of the payments made by DFAS, in support of the Military Branches, Combatant\
  \ Commands, and Defense Agencies for Service Members and Civilian Employees for\
  \ mission required temporary and permanent travel- and/or transportation-related\
  \ expenses.\nThe Department, through DFAS, uses a variety of pre and post payment\
  \ internal controls to identify, prevent, and recoup travel overpayments.\n\nThe\
  \ Commercial Pay PRA program is subject to all of the payments sent to contractors\
  \ and vendors who provided various services and or delivered the required goods\
  \ as outlined in the agreement or contract. The primary objective of the Commercial\
  \ Pay PRA program is to recoup all monetary loss associated with payment made to\
  \ outside contractors and vendors. The Department's PRA Commercial Pay activities\
  \ focus on reporting and correcting any type of monetary loss. As part of the Department’s\
  \ overall system of internal controls, any overpayment that have been identified\
  \ in sampled items for the PIIA compliance audit are reported to the DoD Component\
  \ where the transaction originated. The process is similar to when overpayments\
  \ are discovered through different PIIA audits, reviews, and reports. Regardless\
  \ of the identification source of the overpayment, the Department actively pursues\
  \ all available methods for recouping erroneous overpayments as part of the overarching\
  \ PRA program. \n\nDFAS is the sole service provider for the processing and payroll\
  \ of the Retired and Annuitant populations (R&A) for the Department. DFAS is at\
  \ the forefront of ensuring the appropriate controls are in place to combat and\
  \ assist in the mitigation of risk for potential erroneous or improper payments.\
  \ Based upon the\nguidance from the Department, DFAS R&A quickly worked to identify\
  \ and ascertain their processes that are in place to detect, identify, and recoup\
  \ any erroneous payments through its multiple payroll areas. DFAS is well postured\
  \ to continue to identify the risks associated with payment recapture activities\
  \ and\nimplement checks and balances as a need arises.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of\
  \ Engineers (USACE) Finance Center disburses all of the travel and commercial payments\
  \ for USACE. USACE discovers overpayments through the contract closeout process,\
  \ through routine audits and supplemented by the PIIA audit process. The USACE Finance\
  \ Center Debt Management Office performs the necessary actions to recoup the payment\
  \ once the overpayment is identified and the bill is created.\n\nThe Military Health\
  \ Benefits PRA portfolio is administered and managed by the Defense Health Agency.\
  \ The TRICARE program provides healthcare services to 9.4 million beneficiaries.\
  \ These refunds represent overpayments recovered as a result of payment errors identified\
  \ through the compliance review process, refunds occurring in the course of routine\
  \ healthcare claims processing, healthcare claim adjustments or corrections as identified\
  \ by civilian providers, or TRICARE beneficiaries and claim corrections as the result\
  \ of internal post-payment audits conducted by private sector."

  Retirement & Annuitant Pay (issued by DFAS) is currently in the process of enrolling

  The majority of the flagged payees are based on the Death Master File and the name
  match results from the rest of the DNP databases (e.g., System for Award Management).
  The Department researches all payments that are identified to be potentially improper.
  Research has determined that the majority of these match results are false positives
  (e.g., a vendor’s tax identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s
  social security number, and the payment is erroneously flagged). The remaining matches
  are almost always deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts
  terms and vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed
  properly under contractual agreements). The Department has historically adjudicated
  and deemed proper all potential improper payments identified using the DNP Portal.
  To date, the DNP initiative has not reduced the Department’s improper payments.'
detail_exs1: "The Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) met the overarching\
  \ intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management\
  \ and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C by making Payment Integrity a top\
  \ management priority in developing effective methodologies to help identify, prevent,\
  \ and recover improper payments. The Department sustained the five out of six PIIA\
  \ compliance criteria in the PIIA Compliance Audit. \n\nThe Department's payment\
  \ integrity portfolio comprises 16 separate programs evenly split between Phase\
  \ 1 and Phase 2. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Travel Pay, and\
  \ USACE Commercial Pay, and Military Health Benefits (MHB) – Administrative are\
  \ three Phase 1 programs that delivered comprehensive fiscal year (FY) 2023 risk\
  \ assessments that resulted in low susceptibility of significant Improper (IP) and\
  \ Unknown Payments (UP). The remaining five newly established Phase 1 programs are\
  \ MHB-TRICARE East Region Program (East), MHB-TRICARE West Region Program (West),\
  \ MHB-TRICARE Medicare Eligible Program (TMEP), MHB-TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm),\
  \ and MHB-TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP). The Department will deliver those completed\
  \ risk assessments on or prior to June 30, 2024. The Department will deliver those\
  \ completed risk assessments on or prior to June 30, 2024. The Department has the\
  \ following Phase 2 programs: Civilian Pay, Commercial Pay, Military Pay – Army,\
  \ Military Pay – Navy, Military Pay – Department of the Air Force, Military Pay\
  \ - Marine Corps, Military Retirement, and DoD Travel Pay.\n\nFor FY 2023, the Department\
  \ identified three programs as high priority: Military Health Benefits, Military\
  \ Retirement, and DoD Travel Pay.  The Department successfully closed out all three\
  \ OMB high priority programs in FY 2023 by reducing monetary losses and restructuring\
  \ programs to better align with program objectives.  Furthermore, the Department\
  \ prevented all the Phase 2 programs from becoming a high priority program in FY\
  \ 2024 through its continued efforts to identify error root causes, to focus on\
  \ controls that detect and prevent overpayments, to implement or reinforce applicable\
  \ processes and procedures, and to train staff on policy guidance and best practices.\n\
  \nThe FY 2023 IP and UP results were developed using a revised statistical methodology\
  \ to test more high-risk payment samples, because of a DoD Office of Inspector General\
  \ (OIG) recommendation.  The overarching goal is to achieve PIIA compliance specifically,\
  \ compliance criteria #3 to “publish IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible\
  \ to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying materials to the annual financial\
  \ statement.  The Department’s Phase 2 programs have established a baseline and\
  \ three programs (Military Pay - Navy, Military Pay – Department of the Air Force,\
  \ Military Pay - Marine Corps) reported IP plus UP estimates below the OMB statutory\
  \ threshold.  Therefore, achieving a positive determination on PIIA compliance criteria\
  \ #3 would automatically move those Phase 2 programs to Phase 1 and place them on\
  \ a three-year risk assessment cycle beginning in FY 2024. This is a significant\
  \ accomplishment for the Department and for the specific Military Branches.\n\n\
  In an ongoing effort to improve Payment Integrity reporting for the MHB payment\
  \ portfolio, the MHB – Healthcare program’s IP and UP Risk Assessment resulted in\
  \ a determination to reorganize and restructure the remaining payments not covered\
  \ under administrative costs into groups with similar contractual requirements or\
  \ performance incentives.  The MHB - Healthcare program reorganized into five separate\
  \ programs in FY 2023 based on the different TRICARE contracts that process the\
  \ beneficiary medical claims.  The five programs were designated as Phase 1 in order\
  \ to perform comprehensive risk assessments to determine their accurate susceptibility\
  \ to IP and UP based on their inherent and unique characteristics.  The Department\
  \ is currently performing the new MHB Phase 1 program risk assessments to determine\
  \ the susceptibility to IP and UP. The DoD OIG Payment Integrity audit team is in\
  \ agreement with the MHB portfolio reorganization efforts. This allows the Department\
  \ to focus our resources on identifying the true underlying IP specific to MHB contractual\
  \ requirements opposed to the previous universal methodology for healthcare.  The\
  \ Department is confident in this way forward to streamline MHB PIIA compliance\n\
  \nThe Department has worked diligently to identify $1,735.66 million in monetary\
  \ losses and recovered $1,711.09 million, which demonstrates proper stewardship\
  \ of funding through the Department’s Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.\n"
