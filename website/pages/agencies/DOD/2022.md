detail_ara2_1: The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit and Activities
  (PRA) program is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by DoD
  Components in support of the DoD mission while simultaneously demonstrating financial
  stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a combination
  of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components, PIIA-related
  initiatives, and recovery activities performed by TRICARE private sector contractors.
  The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken by DoD Components
  with additional collection activities performed by the Defense Finance and Accounting
  Service (DFAS), Defense Health Agency (DHA), USACE on behalf of the Department.
detail_ara2_2: The Department’s uncollectable amounts is based primarily on a Military
  Commander or Senior Executive Leader authorized forgiven amounts for a particular
  Service Member, Civilian or Veteran. Overarching reasons include debt processing
  error, VA waiver, erroneous payments, financial hardship, injustice, and deceased
  Service Members.

detail_arp17: The DoD Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program is the Department’s overall
  plan for risk analysis and the performance of payment recovery audits. PRA’s are
  reviews and analyses of program accounting and financial records, supporting documentation,
  and other pertinent information supporting its payments; and, it is, designed specifically,
  to identify overpayments. It is through this system of internal controls surrounding
  the payments that assists in resolving the erroneous non-intentional monetary loss
  of Department dollars. The Department also utilizes collaborative working groups
  and enhanced specific reports that are disseminated to the responsible Component
  for the identification, validation and potential corrective actions for the trends
  of overpayment types if necessary.
detail_arp18: 'The Military Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation
  related entitlements for all Service Members serving on Active Duty, Reserve and
  National Guard. Irrespective of actual assignment, the Service Members Branch handles
  Military Pay. For example, a Service Member assigned to a Combatant Command or Defense
  Agency; the Parent Military Branch is responsible for the Service Members pay. The
  Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) make these payments. The Military
  Branch coupled with DFAS relies heavily on their internal control process for pre
  and post payment reviews, entitlement verifications, reconciling management notices,
  Pay Record Accessibility audit, self-assessment program, and focus metrics program.

  The Department’s Civilian Pay PRA incorporates all salary, benefits and other compensation
  related entitlements for Department Civilians. The Civilian Pay process is dependent
  upon the built in internal controls for accuracy and timely distribution. The Department
  has an internal control structure in place for testing time and attendance that
  provides reasonable assurance that the hours worked, hours in pay status, and hours
  absent are properly recorded.

  The DoD Travel Pay, PRA program incorporates all of the payments made by DFAS, in
  support of the Military Branches, Combatant Commands and Defense Agencies for Service
  Members and Civilian Employees for mission required temporary and permanent travel-
  and/or transportation-related expenses. The Department through DFAS uses a variety
  of pre and post payment internal controls to identify, prevent and recoup travel
  overpayments.

  The Commercial Pay, PRA program is subject to all of the payments sent to Contractors
  and Vendors who provided various services and or delivered the required goods as
  outlined in the agreement or contract. The primary objective of the Commercial Pay
  Payment Recapture/Recovery Audit program is to recoup all monetary loss associated
  with payment made to outside Vendors and Contractors. The Department PRA Commercial
  Pay activities focuses on reporting and correcting any type of monetary loss. As
  part of the Department’s overall system of internal controls, any overpayments that
  have been identified in sampled items for the PIIA Compliance Audit are reported
  to the DoD Component where the transaction originated. The process is similar to
  when overpayments are discovered through different PIIA audits, reviews and reports.
  Regardless of the identification source of the overpayment, the Department actively
  pursues all available methods for recouping erroneous overpayments as part of the
  overarching PRA program.

  DFAS is the sole service provider for the processing and payroll of the Retired
  and Annuitant populations (R&A) for the Department. DFAS is at the forefront of
  ensuring the appropriate controls are in place to combat and assist in the mitigation
  of risk for potential erroneous or improper payments. Based upon the guidance from
  the Department, DFAS R&A quickly worked to identify and ascertain their processes
  that are in place to detect, identify and recoup any erroneous payments through
  its multiple payroll areas. DFAS is well postured to continue to identify the risks
  associated with payment recapture activities and implement checks and balances as
  a need arises.

  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Finance Center (UFC) disburses all of the
  travel and commercial payments for USACE. USACE discovers overpayments through the
  contract closeout process, through routine audits and supplemented by the PIIA audit
  process. The USACE Finance Center Debt Management Office performs the necessary
  actions to recoup the payment once the overpayment is identified and the bill is
  created.

  The Military Health Benefits PRA program administered and managed by the Defense
  Health Agency (DHA). The TRICARE program provides healthcare services to 9.4 million
  beneficiaries. These refunds represent overpayments recovered as a result of payment
  errors identified through the compliance review process, refunds occurring in the
  course of routine healthcare claims processing, healthcare claim adjustments or
  corrections as identified by civilian providers or TRICARE beneficiaries and claim
  corrections as the result of internal post-payment audits conducted by private sector.

  for the following payments: military health benefits (issued by DHA), commercial
  pay (issued by DFAS), and USACE commercial pay (issued by USACE), comprising the
  majority of the payments the Department issues. Retirement & annuitant pay (issued
  by DFAS) is currently in the process of enrolling into DNP with the anticipated
  implementation in FY24. Amongst the three agencies currently enrolled in DNP, the
  Department uses the online search, payment integration, and batch matching features
  of DNP on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.  The majority of the flagged payees
  are based on the Death Master File and the name match results from the rest of the
  DNP databases (e.g., System for Award Management).  The Department researches all
  payments that are identified to be potentially improper. Research has determined
  that the majority of these match results are false positives (e.g., a vendor’s tax
  identification number is matched to a deceased individual’s social security number,
  and the payment is erroneously flagged).  The remaining matches are almost always
  deemed proper based on established business rules related to contracts terms and
  vendor performance (as payments cannot be stopped to vendors who performed properly
  under contractual agreements).  The Department has historically adjudicated and
  deemed proper all potential improper payments identified using the DNP Portal.  To
  date, the DNP initiative has not reduced the Department’s improper payments.'
detail_exs1: "The Department of Defense met the overarching intent of the Payment\
  \ Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\
  \ Circular A-123 Appendix C by making Payment Integrity a top management priority\
  \ in developing effective methodologies to help identify, prevent, and recover improper\
  \ payments. The Department achieved five out of six PIIA compliance criteria, which\
  \ is a substantial improvement from previous PIIA Compliance Audits. Specifically,\
  \ the Department increased the compliance criteria from four in 2020 to five in\
  \ the 2021 PIIA compliance audit by achieving PIIA Compliance number 5, reduction\
  \ targets, during the most recent PIIA Compliance audit. \n\nThe DoD Office of Inspector\
  \ General (OIG) concluded that the Department's previous estimates were unreliable\
  \ and caused primarily by using an inappropriate variable, which led to insufficient\
  \ sample sizes and incomplete universe of transactions (UoT) to pull the Payment\
  \ Integrity sample population for testing. The Department has since implemented\
  \ several DoD OIG recommendations such as: performing UoT reconciliations for the\
  \ Payment Integrity Programs to solidify the Sampling and Estimation Plans and creating\
  \ a Payment Integrity Risk Appetite Statement to verify the effectiveness of the\
  \ population to create the samples from. Additionally, the Department Payment Integrity\
  \ teams have collaborated and have a specific formula that has been approved by\
  \ the DoD OIG to produce more reliable estimates and sufficient sample sizes by\
  \ testing higher and lower risk payment types accordingly. This new formula and\
  \ process is anticipated to produce more reliable estimates and streamline the Department’s\
  \ efforts to achieve compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019\
  \ during the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Payment Integrity compliance audit.\n\nThere\
  \ are currently 12 programs that comprise the DoD’s payment integrity portfolio,\
  \ including: United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Travel Pay, and USACE\
  \ Commercial Pay, and Military Health Benefits - Administrative which are currently\
  \ in Phase 1 and will perform risk assessments in FY2023, Civilian Pay, Commercial\
  \ Pay, Military Health Benefits - Healthcare, Military Pay - Army, Military Pay\
  \ - Navy, Military Pay - Air Force, Military Pay - Marine Corps, Military Retirement,\
  \ and DoD Travel Pay which are in Phase 2.\n\t\nIf the Department had reliable estimates\
  \ and established baselines in FY 2021 based on the FY 2022 PIIA review the following\
  \ four programs would have automatically moved to Phase 1: Commercial Pay, Military\
  \ Pay – Navy, Military Pay – Air Force and Military Pay – Marine Corps. The majority\
  \ of Improper Payments for the Civilian Pay program were attributed to Technically\
  \ Improper Payments (IPs) caused by one overseas pay office. The root cause was\
  \ immediately addressed and corrected in FY 2022. The Military Pay – Army has demonstrated\
  \ continuous progress over the years but is still logistically working through ensuring\
  \ the correct key supporting documentation is housed within the appropriate repository\
  \ making them readily available for audits. The DoD Travel program’s IPs / Unknown\
  \ Payments (UPs) increased principally due to the unfamiliarity with the Department’s\
  \ requirements related to official government travel because of previous travel\
  \ restrictions during COVID; the Department conducted several significant training\
  \ sessions to mitigate this deficiency. Military Health Benefits – Healthcare continued\
  \ to reduce their IP’s from FY 2021 to FY 2022 but is above the statutory threshold.\
  \ The Department will restructure the Military Health Benefits – Healthcare program\
  \ to align to the specific individual contract performance requirements and characteristics\
  \ in FY 2023. The Military Retirement program had a significant increase in projected\
  \ monetary loss outside the agency control based on a timing discrepancy between\
  \ processing payments for retirees and deceased notifications received and processed\
  \ accordingly. The Department is creating an interagency working group with the\
  \ Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Treasury in FY 2023 to address\
  \ these issues and to create solutions in reducing improper payments. Additionally,\
  \ the Department created five new corrective action plans.\n\t\nThe Department has\
  \ worked diligently with the Defense Finance Accounting Service and the DoD Components\
  \ to identify $1,459.09 million specific to monetary losses or overpayments and\
  \ recovered $1,393.97 million, which demonstrates proper stewardship of funding\
  \ through the Department’s Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.\n\n\n\
  \n\t                                                                           \
