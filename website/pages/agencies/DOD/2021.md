  \ sends a weekly file under the “Batch” process which contains invoices in a pre-payment\
  \ status.  Results are available and researched the next day in the Do Not Pay (DNP)\
  \ Portal.  \nDuring FY21, 9.6M invoices amounting to 1.8B were submitted to DNP.\
  \  Since the submission is on a weekly basis in the pre-payment environment, some\
  \ invoices are sent multiple times with no guarantee of actual payment.   Of the\
  \ matched transactions, 8% are considered true positives, which means the DNP system\
  \ correctly identified an issue with the vendor.  However, the vendor falls under\
  \ the established Business Rule which states, if the vendor performed in accordance\
  \ with their contract they are owed the funds.  Additional reasons that may apply\
  \ include a vendor may not be required to be registered in SAM based on existing\
  \ FAR Clauses in their contract.  Of the matched transactions, 92% are false positives\
  \ with 98% of the false positives related to Death Master Data where a deceased\
  \ person’s SSN matches a Company’s TIN in error.  \nIn addition to the Batch process,\
  \ Commercial Pay Treasury Disbursed (TDD) payments are ran through the DNP Death\
  \ Master databases.  This process has not reduced or prevented any improper payments.\
  \  Transactions are researched to determine whether they are a false positive or\
  \ if collection action must be initiated with adjudication in the portal after research.\
  \  \n\nFor Military Health Benefits the Defense Health Agency Contract Resource\
  \ Management (DHA-CRM) individual Payments: DHA-CRM processes relatively few (5–55)\
  \ case recoupment small ($5–$40,000) refunds each month.  The Single Online Search\
  \ (SOS) service is utilized, prepayment, for 100% of all case recoupment refunds\
  \ to verify a payee not been placed on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities\
  \ (LEIE) and to verify an individual has not passed away. Any matches will be referred\
  \ to the DHA Office of General Counsel for adjudication.  \nVendor, Contract Payments:\
  \ CRM processes approximately 191 routine payments per month for 13 unique TRICARE\
  \ private sector care (PSC) payees. The SOS service is utilized, prepayment, once\
  \ a month to verify a PSC payee has not been placed on the Excluded Parties List\
  \ System (EPLS) or the LEIE. The initial DNP Portal (DNP) check is then carried\
  \ for all remaining payments being made to that unique payee for the rest of the\
  \ month.  This process is then repeated every month, maintaining 100% validation\
  \ in the DNP. Any matches are validated with the Treasury Offset Program (TOP),\
  \ ensuring the contractor does not have the same EIN as a person’s SSN.  If the\
  \ contractor is on the SAM, LEIE, and/or TOP list, the finding is referred to the\
  \ assigned Contracting Officer.  For proprietary reasons, the contractor is responsible\
  \ for resolving these matching issues. \nThe risk for payments disbursed via the\
  \ PSC contractor lies outside of CRM’s control. Contractors are not required to\
  \ utilize the DNP at the pre-payment phase to comply with PIIA.\n\n\n"
