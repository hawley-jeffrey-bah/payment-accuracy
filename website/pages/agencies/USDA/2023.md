  Themes:
  - Barriers: There are no known Financial related barriers prohibiting improving
      prevention of improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
      Human error is the primary contributing factor for aggregation errors that occur
      when, in the process of submitting claims for reimbursement, incorrect meal
      counts are recorded or transmitted from schools to School Food Authorities (SFAs),
      from SFAs to State Agencies (SAs), or from SAs to Food and Nutrition Service.
    Info: National School Lunch Program (NSLP) improper payments stemming from failure
      to access data in the Financial category largely relate to errors that occur
      when claims for reimbursement are prepared prior to submission to the State
      Agency (SA). Meal counts from individual points of service are consolidated
      at individual schools. Individual school meal counts are submitted to School
      Food Authorities (SFAs), which are then consolidated again before a claim for
      reimbursement is submitted from SFAs to SAs. Aggregation error occurs when incorrect
      meal counts are recorded, transmitted, or aggregated at any level (school, SFAs).
      SAs then report aggregated claims data to Food and Nutrition Service NSLP.
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: In the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), Household Size is self-reported
      on applications. Existing program rules (automated or "direct" certification
      of applicant households that participate in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
      Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and other programs))
      take full advantage of data matching to limit reliance on self-reported income.
      The remaining applicant households do not exist on other accessible or current
      databases for matching.
    Info: The Household Size eligibility criteria for the National School Lunch Program
      (NSLP) contributes to improper payments because the number of household members
      is required information on an application for benefits and is necessary to determine
      eligibility for program benefits. Households must self-report information about
      Household Size on applications that are submitted to local school districts,
      and districts utilize that information to determine household eligibility for
      school meals. Program staff must consider the self-reported information on Household
      Size in combination with the household income to determine eligibility for program
      benefits based on annual Income Eligibility Guidelines.
    Theme: Household Size
  - Barriers: Within the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), lack of data sharing
      agreements between agencies is a barrier to improving Improper Payments by matching
      data with Receiving Benefits from Other Sources.
    Info: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources impacts National School Lunch Program
      (NSLP) eligibility in one of two ways, depending on the source of the benefits
      received. Households must provide self-reported information on benefits received
      from other sources on an application that is submitted to the local school district,
      and the school district must rely on the information the household provides
      to determine eligibility for school meals. Some benefits received from other
      sources can confer categorical eligibility for free meals. In other cases, program
      staff must compute self-reported income, including benefits received from other
      sources, to determine program eligibility based on annual Income Eligibility
      Guidelines.

    Info: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
      (WIC) eligibility criteria for household size classifies households as a group
      of related or nonrelated individuals who are living together as one economic
      unit. Household size is part of the federal poverty guidelines and used to determine

  - Barriers: Local agency staff working in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
      for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) incorrectly determining automatic or
      adjunctive eligibility are barriers prohibiting improving prevention of improper
      payments.
    Info: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
      (WIC) applicants Receiving Benefits from Other Sources are adjunctively eligible
      if they participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
      Title XIX Medicaid, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). State
      agencies may identify applicants as automatically income eligible if they participate
      in eligible State-administered programs.

  - Barriers: Local agency staff in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
      Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) incorrectly determining an applicants' residence
      is a barrier prohibiting improving prevention of improper payments.
    Info: To meet residency requirements in general, applicants of the Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are required to reside
      in the jurisdiction in which they apply. Exceptions exist for Indian Tribal
      Organizations, migrant farmworkers, homeless individuals, and disaster victims

      (SNAP) eligibliity criteria related to citizenship. Only individuals with a
      qualifying citizenship status may receive SNAP benefits.
    Theme: Citizenship
  - Barriers: There are no known education related barriers prohibiting improving
      prevention of improper payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
    Info: Regulations at 7 CFR 273.5 define Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) eligibility criteria related to education. An individual who is enrolled
      at least half-time in an institution of higher education shall be ineligible
      to participate in SNAP unless the individual qualifies for an exemption, as
      defined at 7 CFR 273.5(b). An individual is considered to be enrolled in an
      institution of higher education if the individual is enrolled in a business,
      technical, trade, or vocational school that normally requires a high school
      diploma or equivalency certificate for enrollment in the curriculum or if the
      individual is enrolled in a regular curriculum at a college or university that
      offers degree programs regardless of whether a high school diploma is required.
    Theme: Education
  - Barriers: There are no known employment related barriers prohibiting improving
      prevention of improper payments in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
    Info: Regulations at 7 CFR 273.7 define Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) eligibility criteria related to employment. To be eligible for SNAP,
      there are general work requirements that include registering for work, participating
      in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by the State agency,
      taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing
      your work hours or work effort below 30 a week without good cause. There are
      exemptions to these requirements, such as age limits, being physically or mentally
      unfit for employment, already working 30 hours a week, meeting work requirements
      for another program, receiving unemployment benefits, certain students, or taking
      care of a child under 6 or an incapacitated person. Able-Bodied Adults Without
      Dependents (ABAWDs) must fulfill separate work requirements in order to receive
      more than three months of SNAP benefits in a three year period, unless they
      meet an exemption to the ABAWD work requirements.
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: There are no known financial related barriers prohibiting improving
      prevention of improper payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
    Info: A household's financial eligibility criteria for Supplemental Nutrition
      Assistance Program (SNAP) is defined at 7 CFR Part 273 Subpart D and includes
      the household's resources and income including earned and unearned income, self-employment
      income, and anticipated income that is reasonably certain. Earned income includes
      salary, wages, and self-employment income and unearned income can come from
      a variety of sources including Social Security Insurance (SSI), Retirement,
      Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI), and pension plans. Resources includes
      both liquid resources, such as cash on hand, savings, and stocks, and non-liquid
      resources, including the non-excluded value of property, vehicles, and land.
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's primary barrier to improving
      payment accuracy related to household composition is that no data match exists
      to validate a household's composition or whether mandatory household members
      are reported and accounted for accurately. Verification must come from the household
      and collateral contacts that know the circumstances of the household.
    Info: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) rules for household composition
      can be found in regulation at 7 CFR 273.1. A SNAP household generally consists
      of an individual living alone; an individual living with others but purchasing
      and preparing food separate and apart from others; and a group of individuals
      living together that purchase and prepare food together. Certain household members
      must be considered the same household, regardless of whether they purchase or
      prepare food together or apart including spouses, a person under 22 years old
      living with their natural or adoptive parents, and a child under 18 who lives
      with and is under the parental control of a household member other than their
      parent.
    Theme: Household Size
  - Barriers: There are no known identity related barriers prohibiting improving prevention
      of improper payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
    Info: Regulations at 7 CFR 273.6 define Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) eligibility criteria related to identity. State agencies must require
      that a household participating or applying for participation in SNAP provide
      the State agency with the social security number (SSN) of each household member
      or apply for one before certification. If individuals have more than one number,
      all numbers shall be required. Refusal or failure without good cause to provide
      a SSN will result in disqualification of the individual for whom a SSN is not
      obtained.
    Theme: Identity
  - Barriers: There are no known residency related barriers prohibiting improving
      prevention of improper payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
    Info: Regulations at 7 CFR 273.3 define Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) eligibility criteria related to residency. A household shall live in
      the State in which it files an application for participation. The State agency
      may also require a household to file an application for participation in a specified
      project area (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2) or office within the State. No individual
      may participate as a member of more than one household or in more than one project
      area, in any month, unless an individual is a resident of a shelter for battered
      women and children as defined in 7 CFR 271.2 and was a member of a household
      containing the person who had abused him or her. The State agency shall not
      require an otherwise eligible household to reside in a permanent dwelling or
      have a fixed mailing address as a condition of eligibility. Nor shall residency
      require an intent to reside permanently in the State or project area. Persons
      in a project area solely for vacation purposes shall not be considered residents.

  \ the receivable is referred to the Department of Treasury for collection, as required\

  \ Act. \nSimilarly, the Forest Service, Rural Development, and Risk Management Agency\

  recovery audits in certain programs based this decision on several factors including:


  •The effective processes the program(s) already has in place to identify, recover,
  and report improper payments;

  • Low improper payment rate;

  • The insignificant amount of improper payments recaptured using the Department’s
  recovery audit program; and

  • If the program contracted for its own audit recovery program, the time and effort

detail_arp18: USDA also recovered $.92M categorized as "other" because these funds
  have yet to be distributed. The inclusion of this figure would increase USDA's recovery
  figure to $143.5. The inclusion of "other" has been utilized in the past USDA and
  OMB recovery reports, however this category was provided as an option to report
  this figure in FY23.

detail_dpa5: "USDA continues to utilize Do Not Pay (DNP) in its efforts to mitigate\
  \ improper payments. USDA programs currently using DNP utilize the Working System\
  \ (the “Portal”) throughout the payment life cycle. All programs utilize the Portal\
  \ during the pre-award step, most utilize pre-award and pre-payment, while a few\
  \ programs utilize pre-award, pre-payment, and post-payment. \n\nThe end of the\
  \ various COVID-19 related assistance programs, which broadened USDA programs in\
  \ a variety of ways, including the amount of funding available and eligibility requirements,\
  \ resulted in USDA DNP search activities returning to pre-pandemic levels. During\
  \ FY 2023, the number of DNP search activities decreased by nearly 95% (118,064\
  \ to 5,068) however the total dollar amount matched from those search activities\
  \ only decreased by approximately 16% ($13.95M to $11.68M). \n\nUSDA has increased\
  \ its active users by approximately 5% from 1,780 in FY 2022 to 1,869 in FY 2023.\
  \ These users span five USDA agencies and multiple program areas. USDA consistently\
  \ increases the number of active users by at least 3% each fiscal year. \n\nUSDA\
  \ is currently in various stages of the enrollment and onboarding process with four\
  \ new program areas. With the addition of these four programs, USDA is anticipating\
  \ increasing user enrollment by 100% to 3400 users. The Department aims to have\
  \ enrollment for these programs completed during FY 2024.\n"

  \ leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, and nutrition.\
  \ A ninth mission area is dedicated to supporting the operational and administrative\
  \ needs of the Department.\n\nBased on the OMB guidelines:\n110 programs were categorized\
  \ as Phase 1 programs;\n13 programs were categorized as Phase 2; and\n38 programs\
  \ had outlays less than $10M.\n\nDuring FY 2023, USDA had one program that was considered\
  \ a High-Priority program: RMA FCIC. This was a reduction from FY 2022, when USDA\
  \ had three High-Priority programs. Additionally, three programs categorized as\
  \ Phase 2 during FY2022 were moved to Phase 1 during FY2023. \n\nThese programs\
  \ are: \nCommodity Credit Corp Trade Mitigation Program\nFarm Service Agency Quality\
  \ Loss Adjustment Program (QLA)\nForest Service Disaster Supplemental- Capital Improvement\
  \ and Maintenance\n\n\nUSDA continues to work towards reducing the Departments improper\
  \ payment rates though utilization of improved training programs, implementation\
  \ of more stringent internal controls, and the growth of USDA’s use of the Do Not\
  \ Pay initiative. \n"
