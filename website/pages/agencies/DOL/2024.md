  - Barriers: This is a small root cause of improper payments in the UI program. Some
      individuals may misrepresent or misunderstand their immigration or work authorization
      status.
    Info: "Federal law requires that benefits not be paid based on service performed\
      \ by an alien unless the individual: 1) was lawfully admitted for permanent\
      \ residence at the time the services were performed and for which the wages\
      \ paid are used as wage credits; 2) was lawfully present in the United States\
      \ to perform the services for which the wages paid are used as wage credits;\
      \ or 3) was permanently residing in the United States “under color of law,”\
      \ including one lawfully present in the United States under provisions of the\
      \ Immigration and Nationality Act. (Note that aliens must also be legally authorized\
      \ to work to be considered available for work.) As such, federal law requires\
      \ that states obtain information about an individual’s authorization to work\
      \ from all applicants for compensation.\n\nFor UI purposes, this means an alien\
      \ must be legally authorized to work at the time benefits are claimed in order\
      \ to meet the availability for work requirements. A claimant who is not a citizen\
      \ or national must present alien registration documentation that the state can\
      \ use to verify satisfactory immigration status through the U.S. Citizenship\
      \ and Immigration Services (USCIS). \n"
    Theme: Citizenship
  - Barriers: The barrier is that states rely on the claimant's knowledge and understanding
      of the option of claiming dependents and the potential of benefits available.
      Another barrier is the readability and plain language issues regarding information
      provided about eligibility.
    Info: Some state laws provide for a dependency allowance in addition to the basic
      weekly benefit amount and some set a maximum number of dependents used to calculate
      the amount of the allowance. Not all states have laws providing for dependency
      allowances.
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: We have defined this per Employment and Training Administration’s (ETA)
      UI program root cause definitions. These improper payments are due to a variety
      of reasons including crossmatches, late responses from employers, and other
      reasons information was not available before the payment was made.
    Info: In order to receive UC, individuals have to prove their ID, must have a
      certain level of wages and/or weeks worked for specific quarters, must be able
      and available for work, actively seeking work, report their weekly earnings
      (if any), and be separated from employment through no fault of their own.
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: 'One of the major barriers to preventing ID fraud is 53 different state
      UI agencies operating 53 different UI IT systems, some of which are outdated
      and in need of modernization. All of these systems have different and independent
      ID verification capabilities and solutions and states have differing ID verification
      policies and procedures. Also, some ID verification solutions may pose equitable
      access issues and states must balance the competing and important goals of program
      integrity and equitable access.

      Access to additional federal, state, and private sector data sources remain
      a barrier to preventing ID fraud in the UI program.

      Additionally, while the Department of Labor (Department) has provided temporary
      funding to support states’ use of ID verification solutions, states lack sufficient
      administrative funding to operate their UC programs effectively. Without an
      ongoing/continued investment in UI program integrity activities and an increase
      in administrative funding for state UC program operations, states will be unable
      to continue paying for ID verification services and solutions. Verifying the
      ID of individuals applying for unemployment benefits is a critical function
      in preventing fraud and reducing improper payments.


      Furthermore, data breaches outside of the unemployment system allow criminals
      access to large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) to use
      for filing fraudulent UC claims. The increasingly sophisticated and complex
      fraud schemes constantly evolving to circumvent state ID verification and fraud
      prevention tools and processes.


      '
    Info: Section 303(a)(1) SSA, requires that a state have methods of administration
      to reasonably ensure the full payment of UC when due. In addition, Section 1137(a)(1),
      SSA, requires states to require the individual to furnish their SSN as a condition
      of eligibility for benefits. These Federal provisions mean, among other things,
      that a state must have a system to reasonably ensure that the name and SSN used
      to establish eligibility for UC belong to the individual filing the claim. Additionally,
      employers and individuals are required to respond to requests from the state
      agencies verifying their identity information.
    Theme: Identity
  - Barriers: 'There was insufficient staff in state UI agencies during the reporting
      period to investigate all potential eligibility issues stemming from Benefit
      Year Earnings (BYE), Social Security Pension Benefits, Deductible Income, Backpay
      awards, Vacation Pay, etc.


      Additionally, access to more robust federal, state, and private sector data
      sources and data matching challenges remain barriers to identifying individuals
      receiving benefits from other sources while also receiving unemployment benefits.

      '
    Info: Receipt of certain types of income affects individuals’ eligibility for
      UC depending on state and federal law.
    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources

    Act
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Timely notification of accurate death data is not always provided to
      the agency and available death data isn't always accurate.  Additionally, many
      of the payments made by the program are done on the periodic roll, which is
      an automated process with annual reviews.  If a claimant or beneficiary passes
      in between the time of the annual review and notice is not provided the payments
      may continue.
    Info: Claimants who are deceased are ineligible to receive benefits.  There is
      no eligibility for a deceased person.  However, an estate may be due funds that
      would have been paid to the claimant or beneficiary prior to or as a result
      of their passing.
    Theme: Deceased
  - Barriers: The information provided by the federal employing agency is incomplete
      or inaccurate.  No automated mechanism exists to determine or validate the accuracy
      of the information reported by the employing agency, or even to ensure that
      all necessary information is submitted with the claim for compensation.
    Info: Pay rate determinations involve calculations based on salary and benefit
      information provided by the employer.  Additionally, in order to appropriately
      maintain benefits, accurate insurance information must be provided.
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: The agency does not have access to any databases that would allow for
      matching payment data with marital status.  Prevention of improper payments
      is done through verification from self-reporting.
    Info: Compensation may be paid at an augmented rate if a claimant is married.   Alternatively,
      compensation may be reduced if the beneficiary is no longer married.

  p.24-27: https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2024/22-24-007-13-001.pdf


  As described in the Executive Summary above, FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for
  PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the
  program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though
  many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program is expired in law
  and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it
  possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent
  with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report  and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting,
  DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment
  integrity reporting is possible. The amount of FY24 PUA outlays is $-1,737.83M.
  DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was developed for
  the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is not applicable
  to negative outlays.

  The Women’s Bureau “program” was recorded as a program for DOL internally, but fell
  slightly below the $10M threshold for reporting as a program in the most recent
  full fiscal year completed and therefor is not included in this PaymentAccuracy.gov
  reporting in FY24. It was however scheduled for a risk assessment in FY24 per the
  required triennial schedule – it was found not susceptible to significant improper
  payments.  Another program, DOL’s FY24 Program Inventory also identified another
  program, Employment & Training Administration - Community Projects, which exceeded
  the $10M outlays threshold in PIIA for the first time per FY24 reporting. Per M-21-19
  requirements a program must exist for a full year before risk assessment and reporting
  is required. However, a preliminary risk assessment found it to be not susceptible.
  Further Risk Assessment and reporting is anticipated for FY25 if outlays continue
  to meet legal thresholds.'
detail_ara2_1: "With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA),\
  \ each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and\
  \ maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation,\
  \ establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish\
  \ overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory\
  \ of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity\
  \ Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases\
  \ such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such as\
  \ tips and leads.\n\nState UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are\
  \ required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery\
  \ efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and\
  \ recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments\
  \ established and recovered.\n\nStates are required to hold claimants liable to\
  \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to\n \nrecover improper\
  \ payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds\
  \ and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must be\
  \ given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities. States may\
  \ waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good\
  \ conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain\
  \ non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\
  \ (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment\
  \ Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances\

  \ UIPL No. 11-23 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity\
  \ functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment\

  \ tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such\
  \ actions):\n•\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief\
  \ and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No. 13- 20,\
  \ Change 2);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered debt (Bipartisan\

  \ Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\tInterstate Reciprocal Offset\
  \ Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\nETA also strongly recommends\
  \ states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed\
  \ by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:\n•\tNegotiating\
  \ repayment plans;\n•\tAccepting repayments through various methods (e.g. online,\
  \ via debit/credit card);\n•\tState Income Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage garnishments;\n\
  •\tProperty liens and assessments;\n•\tOffsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions,\

  •\tState/federal prosecution;\n•\tPenalties and interest on overpayments in compliance\
  \ with state and federal law;\n•\tCollection agency referrals when state staff is\
  \ limited, or debt is uncollectable by other means;\n•\tImplementing a voluntary\
  \ fraud self-disclosure program; and\n•\tOther recovery methods as determined by\
  \ state law or policy.\n"
detail_ara2_2: State UI programs may determine an overpayment to be uncollectable.  In
  most cases this means that all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted
  and the overpayment has been officially written off and/or authorized for removal
  from the active accounts receivable file and transferred to suspense (no further
  action to be taken). However, in cases involving UI identity fraud, when the perpetrator
  of fraud is unknown, a state may also identify the overpayment as “uncollectible”,
  as recovery efforts could not be initiated until the perpetrator of fraud is identified.
  If the perpetrator of fraud is not identified and the state’s law authorizes overpayments
  to be written off, the state is permitted to write-off the overpayment in accordance
  with their state law.  Usually write-offs are applied after the statute of limitations
  expires, bankruptcy has been approved by a court, or the party responsible for the
  overpayment has died.
detail_ara2_3: Prior to FY13, OCFO contracted with a recovery audit contractor - however
  that activity was determined not cost effective. This determination was reconfirmed
  in FY24 for all DOL programs identified for payment integrity reporting purposes,
  excepting the Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment
  Insurance program which provides specific reporting via PaymentAccuracy.gov and
  related Cares Act Benefit programs (PUA, FPUC, & PEUC) now expired in law.

detail_arp17: 'The top root causes of Unemployment Insurance (UI) improper payments
  for Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) 2024 (July 1, 2023 through June 30,
  2024), were: Work Search, Benefit Year Earnings (BYE), and Separation Issues.


  The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically identity (ID) fraud,
  against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19
  pandemic. State UI systems were, and continue to be, targeted by sophisticated and
  organized fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations
  seeking to exploit the UI program for financial gain. A combination of decades of
  underfunding, outdated state UI information technology (IT) systems, record claims
  volumes, and weaker integrity controls in 2020, provided an opportunity for criminals
  to expose vulnerabilities in state UI systems, which resulted in elevated rates
  of improper payments. States have and continue to work tirelessly to combat relentless
  fraud attacks, but the fraud schemes rapidly evolve to circumvent prevention and
  detection tools and strategies implemented by states. ETA continues to issue reminders
  to states about the critical importance of using a multi-layered approach to identify
  and prevent fraud and reduce improper payments.  ETA and state UI agencies work
  collaboratively with the Department’s Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) and
  refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct to DOL-OIG
  for investigation and prosecution.


  The Department places a heightened priority on program integrity and mitigating
  UI fraud risks. ETA remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud
  in the UI programs.  In FY 2024, the Department completely aligned existing UI fraud
  risk management activities with the leading practices provided in the Government
  Accountability Office’s (GAO) Fraud Risk Framework.  Through the development of
  a UI Fraud Risk Profile, the Department further strengthened an organizational culture
  that views the creation, evaluation, monitoring, and evolution of risk mitigation
  strategies as an ongoing process. ETA develops, updates, oversees, and communicates
  UI antifraud strategies through an ever-evolving, robust and dynamic UI Integrity
  Strategic Plan, that includes innovative strategies and antifraud controls to combat
  emerging fraud schemes and address the highest residual risk identified in the UI
  Fraud Risk Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity in the UC programs
  include providing guidance, technical assistance, resources, and funding to support
  states in combatting fraud, strengthening ID verification, reducing IPs, recovering
  overpayments, assessing and addressing fraud risks, protecting victims of ID fraud,
  and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness and equity in fraud prevention and detection
  efforts. The Department continues to explore, research, identify, invest in, and
  provide states with new tools, resources, strategies, and guidance to help states
  combat the continually changing and new emerging types of sophisticated fraud impacting
  the UI system. For more information on the Department’s UI antifraud strategies
  and actions to reduce IPs in unemployment programs, please see the FY 2024 UI Integrity
  Strategic Plan at: https://ui.workforcegps.org/resources/2024/05/30/18/57/UI_Integrity_Strategic_Plan-Antifraud_Strategy

  Requirement focused on Unemployment Compensation Program Integrity. It includes
  a state core performance measure for the UI Improper Payment rate whereby states
  are held to the federal expectation of an Improper Payment Rate that is less than
  10 percent. States failing to meet this expectation are subject to corrective action
  in order to correct the deficiency. A critical part of the agency’s approach to
  improving state performance is providing technical assistance and resources to support
  states in reducing the state Improper Payment rate, that contributes to the reduction
  in the federal Improper Payment rate.

detail_exs1: "In FY23, the Department of Labor’s (DOL), Office of Inspector General\
  \ (DOL-OIG) found the Department’s Federal-State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program\
  \ \"non-compliant\" with certain criteria in PIIA. DOL’s response to DOL-OIG's findings\
  \ are detailed in Management's Response to the OIG's draft report.\n\nIn FY24 DOL\
  \ found two programs to be \"susceptible to significant improper payments (IP)\"\
  . These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State UI program,\
  \ and 2) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act\
  \ (FECA) program. \n\nDOL Overview\nDOL conducts a program inventory annually and\
  \ conducts risk assessments of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis\
  \ as required by M-21-19. In FY24, DOL identified one new program, Bureau of Labor\
  \ Statistics - Headquarters Relocation meeting the $10,000,000 threshold for risk\
  \ assessment and public reporting in FY24, nor were any programs newly determined\
  \ to be \"susceptible to significant IP\". DOL’s FY24 Program Inventory also identified\
  \ another program, Employment & Training Administration - Community Projects, which\
  \ exceeded the $10M outlays threshold in PIIA for the first time per FY24 reporting.\
  \ Per M-21-19 requirements a program must exist for a full year before risk assessment\
  \ and reporting is required. However, a preliminary risk assessment found it to\
  \ be not susceptible. Further Risk Assessment and reporting is anticipated for FY25\
  \ if outlays continue to meet legal thresholds.  \n\nUnemployment Insurance (UI)\
  \ programs: \nDOL bases the Federal-State UI improper payment estimates on results\
  \ of the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) survey, which examines a nationwide\
  \ statistically valid sample of payments made in the three largest permanently authorized\
  \ unemployment compensation programs: State UI program, Unemployment Compensation\
  \ for Federal Employees (UCFE), and Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members\
  \ (UCX). The BAM sample does not include payments made under episodic programs such\
  \ as Extended Benefits (EB) and temporary programs like the Emergency Unemployment\
  \ Compensation (EUC) program and the UI-related programs created by the Coronavirus\
  \ Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, including Pandemic Unemployment\
  \ Assistance (PUA), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Federal\
  \ Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), and Mixed-Earners Unemployment Compensation\
  \ (MEUC) programs. As a result, the $35,196.6M in reported outlays for 2024 include\
  \ $34,949.69M in outlays from the regular Federal-State UI program and $246.92M\
  \ in outlays from the UCFE and UCX programs.\n\nThe period of benefits coverage\
  \ for all pandemic-related UI programs, including PUA, PEUC, FPUC, and MEUC, expired\
  \ in law on September 6, 2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits\
  \ prior to that date. States continued to work backlogs, adjudicate and pay benefits,\
  \ resolve appeals, and determine and collect overpaid benefits under these temporary\
  \ programs in the current reporting period. Several pandemic-related UI programs\
  \ report negative outlays, which is due to states’ ongoing overpayment recovery\
  \ efforts. Since the total outlays for each of the pandemic-related programs were\
  \ less than $10,000,000, no specific data is reported for these programs on PaymentAccuracy.gov.\
  \ These negative outlays were not used to artificially reduce normal UI program\
  \ reported outlays nor impact IP estimates. However, for transparency purposes,\
  \ DOL is reporting the program outlays for the pandemic-related UI programs and\
  \ other temporary and episodic UI programs here:\nEB = $12.06M\nEUC = $0.14M\nFPUC\
  \ = $-1,852.87M\nMEUC = $0.43M\nPEUC = $-269.75M\nPUA = $-1,737.83M\n\nThe PUA program\
  \ was determined \"susceptible\" in FY21. DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation\
  \ Methodology Plan (S&EMP) for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate\
  \ and amount to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on June 30, 2022. In October\
  \ 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded\
  \ through the PUA case review process. OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting\
  \ this additional analysis. In direct collaboration with OMB, the Employment and\
  \ Training Administration (ETA) updated the PUA S&EMP. OMB accepted the update and\
  \ DOL published information on the methodology and the IP estimation on August 21,\
  \ 2023.\n\nFY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering\
  \ the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through\
  \ its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the\
  \ program earlier). Because the program is expired in law and no longer active,\
  \ no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it possible to provide\
  \ an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s\
  \ Agency Financial Report and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment\
  \ Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment integrity PaymentAccuracy.gov\
  \ reporting is possible. In its PIIA compliance report, DOL-OIG recommended reporting\
  \ PUA regardless.  However, if DOL were to do so, it would result in reporting consisting\
  \ almost entirely of “NA” responses since the program has expired. To address DOL-OIG’s\
  \ concern and to be transparent in sharing information, DOL is providing the outlays\
  \ for FY2024 in the PUA program. As noted above, the amount of the PUA outlays is\
  \ $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was\
  \ developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is\
  \ not applicable to negative outlays. DOL notified OMB of the decision to reclassify\
  \ FPUC, PEUC, and PUA as Phase 0 and is not expected to provide further reporting\
  \ under M-21-19."
