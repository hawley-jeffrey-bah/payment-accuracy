  \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper\
  \ payments. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be\
  \ against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also\
  \ waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\
  \ and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance\
  \ (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change\
  \ 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent\
  \ overpayment.\n\nETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed\
  \ below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):\n\
  •\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job\
  \ Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) (Bipartisan\
  \ Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19 and 12-14);\n•\tCross Program Offset Recovery\
  \ Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\tInterstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery\
  \ Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\nETA also strongly recommends states use\
  \ the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state\
  \ law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:\n•\tState Income\
  \ Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage Garnishments;\n•\tCivil Actions;\n•\tProperty Liens;\n\
  •\tCollection Agency Referrals;\n•\tCredit Bureau Referrals;\n•\tProbate and bankruptcy;\n\
  •\tReferral to DOL-OIG and law enforcement;\n•\tState/Federal prosecution;\n•\t\
  Offset lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;\n•\tSkip tracing;\n\
  •\tEstablishment of interest and penalties on overpayments, which adds an incentive\
  \ to repay quickly;\n•\tNegotiating repayment plans; and\n•\tAccepting repayments\
  \ through various methods (online, via credit card, etc.).\n\n"
detail_ara2_2: State UI programs may write off an overpayment when they determine
  it as uncollectable. This means that all reasonable collection efforts have been
  exhausted and the overpayment has been officially written off and/or authorized
  for removal from the active accounts receivable file and transferred to suspense
  (no further action to be taken).
detail_ara2_3: Prior to FY13, OCFO contracted with a recovery audit contractor - however
  that activity was determined not cost effective. This determination was reconfirmed
  in 2022 for all DOL programs identified for payment integrity reporting purposes
  excepting the Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment
  Insurance program which provides specific reporting in this DataCall.

detail_arp17: 'The top root causes of UI improper payments for Payment Integrity Information
  Act (PIIA) 2022 (July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022), were: Benefit Year Earnings
  (BYE), Separation Issues, and Other Eligibility improper payments (which includes
  the Identity Theft cause code).  The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks against
  state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  State UI systems were targeted by sophisticated and organized fraud, perpetrated
  by domestic and international criminal organizations. Fraud schemes continue to
  evolve to circumvent prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by
  states. ETA and state UI agencies continue to work collaboratively with the Department’s
  Office of Inspector General (OIG) and refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement,
  and misconduct to the Department’s OIG for investigation and prosecution.


  ETA remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud in the UI programs
  and continues to make UI program integrity a top agency priority. ETA develops,
  updates, and oversees implementation of a robust and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic
  Plan, which continuously evolves and includes innovative strategies to address emerging
  fraud schemes, prevent and reduce UI improper payments, and recover benefits that
  were overpaid. ETA’s FY 2022 efforts included providing guidance, technical assistance,
  and funding to support states in combatting fraud and reducing IP based on the top
  root causes of UI improper payments. ETA also invested in developing new and enhancing
  existing tools, datasets, and resources and made these available to aid states in
  more quickly identifying potential IP and fraud. For more information on the top
  root causes of UI improper payments and ETA’s UI integrity strategies and actions
  in FY 2022, see the FY 2022 UI Integrity Strategic Plan - https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/integrity_plan.asp

  List, as appropriate. Programs with a business need use the DNP Working Solution
  when determined cost-effective to review against appropriate databases. The dollar
  effect of these reviews is impossible to quantify overall in preventing IP. In addition,
  the FECA program conducts data analytics and cross-referencing with the DNP Business
  Center to mitigate the risk of inappropriate inter-Agency dual benefits.
detail_exs1: "In FY22 the Department of Labor (DOL) found three programs to be \"\
  susceptible to significant improper payments (IP)\". These are 1) the Employment\
  \ and Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program,\
  \ 2) the Employment and Training Administration - Pandemic Unemployment Assistance\
  \ (PUA) program, and 3) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees'\
  \ Compensation Act (FECA) program. Two UI benefit programs created in response to\
  \ the Pandemic, the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) and the\
  \ Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) both provide payment integrity\
  \ reporting as part of the UI program. \n\nThe PUA program was determined \"susceptible\"\
  \ in FY21.  DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan for estimating\
  \ the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the Office of Management\
  \ and Budget (OMB) 0n June 30 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct\
  \ further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case review process.\
  \  OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional analysis, but\
  \ it can not be completed in time to meet this year’s reporting deadline, therefore,\
  \ OMB allowed additional time  to conduct this analysis and report on the PUA program\
  \ outcomes in FY23.\n\nAll Pandemic-related UI programs (PUA, PEUC, and FPUC) expired\
  \ in law on 9/6/2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits prior to\
  \ that date. None of these programs provided benefits for weeks of unemployment\
  \ in FY22. \n\nDOL conducts a program inventory annually, and conducts risk assessments\
  \ of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19.\
  \ No new DOL programs were identified in FY22, nor were any existing programs newly\
  \ determined to be \"susceptible to significant IP\"."
