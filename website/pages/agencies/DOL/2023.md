    Insurance
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The barrier is that states rely on the claimant's knowledge and understanding
      of the option of claiming dependents and the potential of benefits available.
      Another barrier is the reading and comprehension level of the claimant.
    Info: Some state laws provide for a dependency allowance in addition to the basic
      weekly benefit amount and some set a maximum number of dependents used to calculate
      the amount of the allowance. Not all states have laws providing for dependency
      allowances.
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: We have defined this per Employment and Training Administration’s Unemployment
      Insurance program root cause definitions. Office of Management and Budget guidance
      at the time of reporting provided inadvertent duplicate definitions across multiple
      root cause categories. These improper payments are due to a variety of reasons
      including crossmatches, late responses from employers, and other reasons information
      was not available before the payment was made.
    Info: In order to receive Unemployment Compensation, individuals have to prove
      their identity, must have a certain level of wages and/or weeks worked for specific
      quarters, must be able and available for work, actively seeking work, report
      their weekly earnings (if any), and be separated from employment through no
      fault of their own.
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: "One of the major barriers to preventing identity fraud is 53 different\
      \ state Unemployment Insurance agencies operate 53 different Unemployment Insurance\
      \ systems. All of these systems have different and independent identity verification\
      \ capabilities and solutions and states have differing identity verification\
      \ policies and procedures. Also, some identity solutions may pose equitable\
      \ access issues and states must balance these competing goals.\n\nAccess to\
      \ additional federal, state, and private sector data sources remain a barrier\
      \ to preventing identity fraud in the Unemployment Insurance program. \n\nAlthough\
      \ the federal government has provided temporary funding to support states’ use\
      \ of identity verification solutions, states lack sufficient administrative\
      \ funding to operate their Unemployment Compensation programs effectively. \
      \ Without an increase in administrative funding for state Unemployment Compensation\
      \ program operations or the availability of ongoing federal grants to support\
      \ identity verification, states cannot continue to support ongoing maintenance\
      \ expenses for identity verification services and solutions in their Unemployment\
      \ Compensation programs.  \n\nAdditionally, data breaches outside of the unemployment\
      \ system allow criminals access to large amounts of personally identifiable\
      \ information to use for filing fraudulent Unemployment Compensation claims.\
      \ The increasingly sophisticated and evolving fraud schemes circumvent state\
      \ identity verification and fraud prevention tools and processes."
    Info: 'Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (SSA), requires that a state
      have methods of administration to reasonably ensure the full payment of Unemployment
      Compensation when due. In addition, Section 1137(a)(1), SSA, requires states
      to require the individual to furnish their Social Security Number as a condition
      of eligibility for benefits. These Federal provisions mean, among other things,
      that a state must have a system to reasonably ensure that the name and Social
      Security Number used to establish eligibility for Unemployment Compensation
      belong to the individual filing the claim.


      Additionally, employers and individuals are required to respond to requests
      from the state agencies verifying their identity information.'
    Theme: Identity
  - Barriers: There was insufficient staff in state Unemployment Insurance agencies
      during the reporting period to investigate all potential eligibility issues
      stemming from Benefit Year Earnings, Social Security Pension Benefits, Deductible
      Income, Backpay award, Vacation Pay, etc.
    Info: Receipt of certain types of income affects individuals’ eligibility for
      unemployment compensation depending on state and federal law.
    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources
- Program_Name: Employment & Training Administration - Unemployment Insurance - Federal
    Pandemic Unemployment Assistance
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'Initially the PUA program was designed to rely solely on self-attestation
      for eligibility for the first nine months, and the identity verification requirement
      was added later.  Another barrier to preventing identity fraud is that 53 different
      state UI agencies operate 53 different and independent UI systems. All of these
      systems have different identity verification capabilities and solutions and
      states have differing identity verification policies and procedures. Also, some
      identity solutions may pose equitable access issues and states must balance
      these competing goals.


      Access to additional federal, state, and private sector data sources remain
      a barrier to preventing identity fraud in the UI program.


      Although the federal government has provided temporary funding to support states’
      use of identity verification solutions, states lack sufficient administrative
      funding to sustain these types of operations. Without an increase in administrative
      funding for state UC program operations or the availability of ongoing federal
      funding to support identity verification, states cannot continue to support
      ongoing maintenance expenses for identity verification services and solutions
      in their UC programs.


      Additionally, data breaches outside of the unemployment system allow criminals
      access to large amounts of personally identifiable information to use for filing
      fraudulent UC claims. The increasingly sophisticated and evolving fraud schemes
      circumvent state identity verification and fraud prevention tools and processes.

      Finally, this program expired in law on 9/6/2021. It is no longer paying out
      benefits & cannot be reformed now to improve integrity. This Survey reflects
      a review of the full life of the program - no further reporting is possible.

      '
    Info: Section 2102(f) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Employment Security (CARES)
      Act was amended on December 27, 2020, to add an identity verification requirement
      regarding applicants of the PUA program.  This new eligibility requirement became
      effective 30 days after enactment.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: Timely notification of accurate death data is not always provided to
      the agency and death data available isn't always accurate. Additionally, many
      of the payments made by the agency are made on the periodic roll, which is an
      automated process with annual reviews. If a claimant/beneficiary passes in between
      the time of the annual review and notice is not provided the payments may continue.
    Info: Claimants who are deceased are ineligible to receive compensation benefits
      from the agency. There is no eligibility for the deceased person. However, an
      estate may be due funds that would have been due to the claimant or beneficiary
      prior to or as a result of their passing.
    Theme: Deceased
  - Barriers: 'The information provided by the Federal employing agency is incomplete
      or inaccurate. No automated mechanism exists to determine or validate the accuracy
      of the information reported by the employing agency, or even to ensure that
      all necessary information is submitted with the claim for

      compensation.'
    Info: 'Pay rate calculations involve calculations based on salary and benefit

      information provided by the employer. Additionally, in order to appropriately
      maintain benefits for insurance accurate information must be provided.'
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: The agency does not have access to any databases that would allow for
      matching payment data with marital status. Prevention of improper payments is
      done through verification from self reporting.
    Info: 'Compensation may be paid an augmented rate if a claimant is married.

      Alternatively, compensation may be reduced if a beneficiary is no longer married.'

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: 'Previously reporting programs are automatically risk assessed
    as "susceptible for significant IP" until or unless they report outlays or IP
    rates below the reporting threshold. PEUC and FPUC have been reported as part
    of the Federal-State Unemployment Insurance program per OMB instruction and continued
    to be reported this year despite having expired in law in 2021. PEUC outlays continue
    to exceed the $10M threshold for reporting due to wind-down.  Although the FPUC
    outlays are below the $10M threshold, DOL includes these FPUC outlays to provide
    transparency of this high-profile pandemic program.  The negative value of FPUC
    outlays reflects the benefit payouts for the reporting period not exceeding the

detail_ara2_1: "With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA),\
  \ each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and\
  \ maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation,\
  \ establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish\
  \ overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory\
  \ of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity\
  \ Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases\
  \ such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such as\
  \ tips and leads.\n\nState UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are\
  \ required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery\
  \ efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and\
  \ recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments\
  \ established and recovered.\n\nStates are required to hold claimants liable to\
  \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper\
  \ payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds\
  \ and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must be\
  \ given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities.  States\
  \ may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and\
  \ good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery\
  \ of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\
  \ Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment\
  \ Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances\
  \ may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.\n\nETA issued\
  \ UIPL No. 23-20 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity\
  \ functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment\
  \ compensation (UC) programs and consolidated, clarified, and expanded these activities\
  \ with the issuance of UIPL No. 11-23.   ETA requires states to use the overpayment\
  \ recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require\
  \ such actions):\n•\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax\
  \ Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No.\
  \ 13- 20, Change 2);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered debt\
  \ (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);\n•\tCross Program\
  \ Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\tInterstate Reciprocal\
  \ Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\nETA also strongly recommends\
  \ states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed\
  \ by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:\n•\tNegotiating\
  \ repayment plans;\n•\tAccepting repayments through various methods (e.g. online,\
  \ via debit/credit card);\n•\tState Income Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage garnishments;\n\
  •\tProperty liens and assessments;\n•\tOffsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions,\
  \ and other benefits;\n•\tActive participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings\
  \ regarding an individual with an outstanding overpayment;\n•\tSkip tracing;\n•\t\
  Work proactively and collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect\
  \ suspicious activity, ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover\
  \ overpayments (UIPL No. 19-21);\n•\tCivil actions;\n•\tCredit bureau referrals;\n\
  •\tState/federal prosecution;\n•\tPenalties and interest on overpayments in compliance\
  \ with state and federal law; \n•\tCollection agency referrals when state staff\
  \ is limited, or debt is uncollectable by other means; \n•\tImplementing a voluntary\
  \ fraud self-disclosure program; and \n•\tOther recovery methods as determined by\
  \ state law or policy."
detail_ara2_2: State UI programs may write off an overpayment when they determine
  it as uncollectable. This means that all reasonable collection efforts have been
  exhausted and the overpayment has been officially written off and/or authorized
  for removal from the active accounts receivable file and transferred to suspense
  (no further action to be taken).
detail_ara2_3: Prior to FY13, OCFO contracted with a recovery audit contractor - however
  that activity was determined not cost effective. This determination was reconfirmed
  in FY23 for all DOL programs identified for payment integrity reporting purposes,
  excepting the Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment
  Insurance program which provides specific reporting in this DataCall and related
  Cares Act Benefit programs (PUA, FPUC, & PEUC) now expired in law.

  \ a robust and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan, which continuously evolves and\
  \ includes innovative strategies and antifraud controls to combat emerging fraud\
  \ schemes and address the highest residual risk identified in the UI Fraud Risk\
  \ Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity in the unemployment compensation\
  \ (UC) programs include providing guidance, technical assistance, resources, and\
  \ funding to support states in combatting fraud, strengthening ID verification,\
  \ reducing IPs, recovering overpayments, assessing and addressing fraud risks, protecting\
  \ victims of ID fraud, and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness and equity in\
  \ fraud prevention and detection efforts. The Department continues to explore, research,\
  \ identify, invest in, and provide states with new tools, resources, strategies,\
  \ and guidance to help states combat the continually changing and new emerging types\
  \ of sophisticated fraud impacting the UI system. For more information on the Department’s\

  Requirement focused on Unemployment Compensation Program Integrity.  It includes
  a state core performance measure for the UI Improper Payment rate whereby states
  are held to the federal expectation of an Improper Payment Rate that is less than
  10 percent.  States failing to meet this expectation are subject to corrective action
  in order to correct the deficiency.  A critical part of the agency’s approach to
  improving state performance is providing technical assistance and resources to support
  states in reducing the state Improper Payment rate, that contributes to the reduction
  in the federal Improper Payment rate.

  when determined cost-effective to review against appropriate databases. The dollar
  effect of these reviews in overall IP prevention is impossible to quantify . In
  addition, the FECA program conducts data analytics and cross-referencing with the
  DNP Business Center to mitigate the risk of inappropriate inter-Agency dual benefits.


  DOL programs with matches in the DNP Portal are directly responsible for reviewing
  and adjudicating. They are not required to report IP prevented to DNP nor DOL-OCFO.
  Further, DNP identified a technical performance issue that occurred in November
  2022, which affected the loading of the payment matches in Payment Integration.
  As a result of this error, there were a number of matched payments that should have
  been included in the November 2022 reporting, but did not appear.  Responses to
  DataCall questions regarding IP prevented by the DNP Portal (e.g., DPA6&7) represent

detail_exs1: "In FY22, OIG found DOL UI program \"non-compliant\" with certain criteria\
  \ in PIIA. DOL had concerns about OIG's findings on these criteria as detailed in\
  \ Management's Response to the OIG's draft report. \n\nIn FY23 the Department of\
  \ Labor (DOL) found three programs to be \"susceptible to significant improper payments\
  \ (IP)\". These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State\
  \ Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, 2) the Employment and Training Administration\
  \ - Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, and 3) the Office of Workers'\
  \ Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program. Despite having\
  \ expired in law as of September 6, 2021 and no benefits were paid for weeks of\
  \ eligibility in the current reporting period, two UI benefit programs created in\
  \ response to the Pandemic, the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)\
  \ and the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) both provide payment\
  \ integrity reporting as part of the UI program.\n\nThe PUA program was determined\
  \ \"susceptible\" in FY21. DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan\
  \ (S&EMP) for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the\
  \ Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on June 30, 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested\
  \ that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case\
  \ review process. OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional\
  \ analysis. In direct collaboration with OMB, the Employment and Training Administration\
  \ (ETA) updated the PUA S&EMP. OMB accepted the update and DOL published information\
  \ on the methodology and the IP estimation on August 21, 2023.\n\nAll Pandemic-related\
  \ UI programs (PUA, PEUC, and FPUC) expired in law on September 6, 2021, though\
  \ some states stopped offering these benefits prior to that date. None of these\
  \ programs provided benefits for weeks of unemployment in FY23.  States continued\
  \ to work backlogs adjudicating and paying benefits under these temporary program\
  \ in the current reporting period.  However, the total outlays for the FPUC program\
  \ were less than $10,000,000 , and thus no data is reported for this program. \n\
  \nDOL conducts a program inventory annually and conducts risk assessments of all\
  \ identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19. No new\
  \ DOL programs meeting the $10,000,000 threshold for reporting were identified in\

  Insurance program per OMB instruction and continued to be reported this year despite
  having expired in law in 2021. PEUC outlays continue to exceed the $10M threshold
  for reporting due to wind-down.  Although the FPUC outlays are below the $10M threshold,
  DOL includes these FPUC outlays to provide transparency of this high-profile pandemic
