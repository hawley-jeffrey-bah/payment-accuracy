detail_dpa5: 'ARC Our service provider, ARC  does continuous monitoring of all suppliers
  using the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. On a weekly basis all active suppliers are submitted
  and processed in a nightly run that returns a list of suppliers which matched against
  database with the results that could indicate they should not be paid by the government.
  Most results we see are deceased individuals or suppliers that have not reviewed
  and approved their records in the SAM database within the past year and therefore
  their SAM registration is not current. All suppliers found on this list are immediately
  end dated so they cannot be used. On the rare occasion it would be for other reasons
  the Customer Care accountant is notified to follow up with the Customer.

  In addition, on a regular daily basis we use the DNP portal to submit Disaster Recovery
  Applicants and results are returned to Treasury.'
detail_exs1: The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requires agencies
  to periodically review all programs and identify those that may be susceptible to
  significant improper payments and provide an annual report on monitoring and minimization
  efforts. The RESTORE Council conducts risk assessments for all programs with outlays
  over 10M on a three year risk assessment cycle. The results of those assessments
  indicate that the agency does not have any programs which are likely to be susceptible
  to significant improper payments .
