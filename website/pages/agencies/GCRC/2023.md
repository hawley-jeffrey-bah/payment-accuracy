detail_ara2_3: In accordance with the guidelines set forth in A-123 Appendix C, it
  is required for agencies to perform recapture audits for programs and activities
  that have an annual expenditure of $1 million or more, as long as conducting such
  audits proves to be cost-effective. After careful consideration, the Restore Council
  has determined that conducting payment recapture audits would not be a cost-effective
  endeavor. This decision is based on the historical data showing a low occurrence
  of improper payments and the fact that the costs associated with conducting a formal
  recapture audit outweigh the benefits. Specifically, our service provider reported
  an audit cost of $4,737.48 for the FY2022 recapture audit, while only one improper
  payment was identified and collected, amounting to $16.88.

  Fiscal Service ARC regularly checks suppliers through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal.
  This includes a weekly run that identifies active suppliers who should not be paid
  by the government. If any supplier is found on that list, they are promptly deactivated
  and cannot be used.
detail_exs1: 'The Treasury Office of the Inspector General audit for the fiscal year
  2022 has determined that the Restore Council was compliant with the requirements
  set forth in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).


  The Restore Council conducts risk assessments for all programs that have outlays
  over $10M on a three-year risk assessment cycle. The most recent risk assessment
  was performed in fiscal year 2022 and concluded that the agency has no programs
  that are likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. The agency plans
  to conduct its next PIIA risk assessment in the fiscal year 2025.

detail_pcp14: Although the Office of Inspector General (OIG) did not propose any recommendations
  to enhance the prevention or reduction of Improper Payments and Unknown Payments,
  it did recommend the Council refer to the Payment Integrity Annual Data Call Instructions
  or subsequent revisions issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine
  the appropriate method of reporting payment integrity information. Additionally,
  the OIG recommended that the Council carefully review the payment integrity information
  submitted to the OMB Annual Data Call prior to publication to ensure the accuracy
  of the reported data.
