detail_ara2_3: The OMB guidance addresses implementing payment recapture audits, for
  programs and activities that expend $1 million or more annually, provided it is
  cost-effective to do so. In accordance with the OMB guidance, the EEOC reviewed
  its programs and activities and determined that none of the agency’s programs or
  activities was susceptible to making significant improper payments and that the
  implementation of a payment recapture audit would not be cost-effective.

  (OEDA).
detail_cap4: In a performance agreement for the official, incentives and consequences
  are meant to be aligned with the official's efforts to enhance payment accuracy,
  prevent fraud, and bring the agency into compliance. Incentives may include financial
  rewards, recognition, and access to additional training and development opportunities
  to enhance skills and expertise. Conversely, consequences may include being held
  accountable for any significant lapses in payment integrity due to gross negligence,
  reputational impact which might affect their future career prospects, and legal
  consequences for the agency. Effective performance agreements create a strong incentive
  for the official(s) to diligently work toward improving payment accuracy and preventing
  fraud, as their professional advancement and reputation, as well as the reputation
  of the agency, are directly affected by their ability to meet these goals.

detail_dpa5: The EEOC does not presently use the Do Not Pay Initiative (DNP) as the
  EEOC is cross-serviced by the Department of Interior, Interior Business Center (DOI/IBC)
  for accounting system support and accounts payable processing.  As a result, the
  implementation of the DNP initiative is a joint responsibility between the EEOC
  and IBC. Prior to making a new contract award, the EEOC utilizes the System for
  Award Management (SAM) to see if the vendor is excluded from receiving contracts.
  If SAM does not list any exclusions, the EEOC submits a new vendor request to IBC.
  The IBC Vendor Maintenance Team verifies EEOC’s entire new employee and Non-Federal
  Vendor requests against the Department of Treasury’s DNP database and if the IBC
  Vendor Maintenance Team finds a positive match, they notify the EEOC. The EEOC reviews
  the match, determines if the payment is proper, and reports the result.
detail_exs1: "In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\
  \ (EEOC) conducted Improper Payment Testing over its Transaction Universe in accordance\
  \ with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, OMB Memorandum M-21-19, Section VIII, and\
  \ Standard Operating Procedures. Per the Agency Financial Statements reported to\
  \ OMB in the prior year, the EEOC had four (4) programs with annual outlays greater\
  \ than $10M in FY 2022: Pay & Benefits ($320M); Other Contractual Services ($44M);\
  \ Rental & Payments ($33M); and State & Local ($27M). Accordingly, for FY 2023,\
  \ the EEOC conducted scheduled reviews and audits of Payroll, Vendor Payments, and\
  \ Travel payments. \n\nFor Payroll, the EEOC conducted bi-weekly quality reviews\
  \ of payroll actions and an annual audit of the payroll function in totality. EEOC\
  \ is also developing an electronic tool to strengthen internal controls by identifying\
  \ payroll discrepancies after the transactions have been processed. \n\nFor Vendor\
  \ and Travel Payments, testing was done in April 2023 for FY 2023 Quarters 1 and\
  \ 2, and in October 2023 for the FY 2023 Quarters 3 and 4. The methodology utilized\
  \ random sampling of 1% of the payment population in each category, with a 95% confidence\
  \ level. There were no Improper Payments identified for either testing period."

detail_pcp14: It was recommended that EEOC should determine a responsible official
  or office with overall responsibility for compliance with PIIA agency-wide. It was
  also recommended that EEOC develop agency-wide Improper Payment risk assessment
  standard operating procedures (SOP) based on OMB A-123 Appendix C guidance that
  identified program points of contact and means to ensure compliance with annual
  review and reporting compliance.
