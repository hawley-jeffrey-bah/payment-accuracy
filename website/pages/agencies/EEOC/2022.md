detail_ara2_3: The EEOC does not administer grant, benefit, or loan programs. The
  EEOC has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program for vendor
  payments is not cost-effective. The benefits or recaptured amounts associated with
  implementing and overseeing the program do not exceed the costs, including staff
  time and resources, or payments to a contractor for implementation, of a payment
  recapture audit program. The EEOC considered its low improper payment rate based
  on testing conducted in fiscal year 2020 and Financial Statement Testing conducted
  in fiscal year 2021.
detail_ara2_3_2: Vendor Payments were considered to be non-cost effective for recovery
  audits.

  audits for each program is cost-effective.

detail_dpa5: The EEOC is cross-serviced by the Department of Interior, Interior Business
  Center (DOI/IBC) for accounting system support and accounts payable processing.
  As a result, the implementation of the Do Not Pay initiative is a joint responsibility
  between the EEOC and IBC.  Prior to making a new contract award, the EEOC checks
  the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)
  for a match. If there is no match, the agency submits a new vendor request to IBC
  who verifies the agency's Non-Federal Vendor and new employee request against the
  Department of Treasury's Don Not Pay database. IBC will notify EEOC if a positive
  match is found. EEOC will determine if the payment is proper and report the result.
detail_exs1: For FY 2022, the EEOC reviewed programs and activities it administers
  with an outlay greater than $10.0M per the Payment Integrity Information Act requirements.
  The programs with outlays greater than $10.0M are payroll, travel, and accounts
  payable.
