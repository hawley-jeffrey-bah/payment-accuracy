Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility
    to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper payment,
    establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with OMB guidance,
    and develops and implements corrective actions. In previous years, the Department
    established a two-part process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed
    by a comprehensive assessment if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process
    is used on all programs not already reporting an improper payment estimate and
    that meet the minimum disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive
    risk assessment process is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results
    and the program’s three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive
    risk assessments, Component personnel held meetings with program managers, key
    personnel, and other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments.
    The Department’s comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes
    that directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the
    GAO Standards for Internal Control (Green Book) framework as well as OMB Circular
    No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. Additionally, the Department conducts independent
    reviews of Component submissions to identify significant changes in the program
    compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of the risk ratings.

detail_agy1: 'The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility
  to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper payment,
  establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with OMB guidance,
  and develops and implements corrective actions. In previous years, the Department
  established a two-part process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed by
  a comprehensive assessment if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process
  is used on all programs not already reporting an improper payment estimate and that
  meet the minimum disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment
  process is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s
  three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments,
  components held meetings with program managers, key personnel, and other stakeholders
  to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments. The Department’s comprehensive
  risk assessment involves evaluating attributes that directly or indirectly affect
  the likelihood of improper payments using the GAO Standards for Internal Control
  (Green Book) framework as well as OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. Additionally,
  the Department conducts independent reviews of Component submissions to identify
  significant changes in the program compared to last year and assess the reasonableness
  of the risk ratings.


  The Department uses a statistically valid, stratified sample design performed by
  a statistician to select and test disbursements for those programs identified as
  susceptible to significant improper payments. DHS procedures continue to strive
  for an overall estimate of the percentage of improper payment dollars within

  ±2.5 percent precision at the 95 percent confidence level. Many of the Phase 2 programs
  within DHS utilize a stratified random sampling approach where payments are grouped
  into mutually exclusive “strata,” or groups based on total dollars. To estimate
  improper payment dollars for the population from the sample data, the stratum-specific
  ratio of improper and/or unknown dollars to total payment dollars is calculated.


  As highlighted through the reported estimates, DHS continues to prioritize corrective
  actions, as necessary, while also aiming for full compliance with PIIA requirements.
  DHS remains strongly committed to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability
  to the American taxpayer and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction
  of improper payments.'

detail_ara2_3: 'DHS performs regular monitoring and conducts recovery activities throughout
  the year. As such, historical recovery audit efforts indicated that many identified
  overpayments had already been identified by the agency and thus were not applicable
  for recovery audit vendor commission. Given the low return on value for the recovery
  audit vendors, DHS was unsuccessful in keeping a vendor in place for this effort
  in previous years due to cost inefficiency for the vendor and for DHS.


  Based on additional cost-benefit analysis, DHS has examined the program structures,
  payment types and transaction volume, success rates in recoupment, as well as the
  expected cost incurred examining labor costs, clearance and equipment costs, commission
  payments, etc. Cost analysis reviews conducted to date have not successfully determined
  that any of the programs would be cost beneficial for recovery audit efforts. DHS
  continues to refine the information within the analysis, and if determined to be
  cost effective, will work through procurement channels to move forward with establishing
  a recovery audit mechanism going forward.'
detail_ara2_3_2: Based on cost benefit analysis conducted in previous year, the recovery
  audit efforts were halted for all DHS programs. In recent years, DHS has worked
  to refresh the cost benefit analysis to ensure that prior decision that recovery
  audits are not cost effective for the Department, or specific entities within the
  Department, remains an accurate position. Cost analysis reviews conducted to date
  have not successfully determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial
  for recovery audit efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis,
  and if determined to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to
  move forward with establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward. Analysis
  has covered all DHS Components, applicable payment types, and programs. Generalized
  results show that given the cost to enter into a recovery audit contract, support
  and administer the contract, provide applicable and necessary documentation, and
  payment of the vendor commission in comparison to the DHS recoupment timeline and
  success rate, the cost to perform the recovery audit efforts has outweighed the
  benefit to the agency.

  Although collection methods vary by Components and programs, DHS utilizes a broad
  array of approaches and tools to recover overpayments once identified. For programs
  that utilized Treasury''s Invoice Payment Processing (IPP) system, the payment off-set
  can be utilized to off-set the overpayment amount against a to-be paid invoice to
  the same vendor in the system. In addition, the Treasury reclamation process is
  used once a receivable established to recover an overpayment has aged and can be
  referred for Treasury collection processing. DHS widely utilizes the accounts receivable
  process to generate a receivable that then prompts a collection notification process.
  Notifications and/or dunning letters are sent on a prescribed frequency in an attempt
  to recover the overpayment amount. When the above approaches are unsuccessful, there
  are occasions where legal involvement is required that may include a judgement collection
  and/or a contract suspension.'

  and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments.
  In addition, the Department’s CFO, Deputy CFO, and senior staff have

  performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship
  incorporated into their annual performance plans.


  As a strong internal control environment is the best way to prevent and detect improper
  payments, Component managers are responsible for completing internal control work
  on payment processing as part of the Department’s OMB Circular No. A-123 effort.
  They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient internal
  controls, including a control environment that prevents improper payments from being
  made, effectively managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering
  any improper payment that may occur.'

  which the DNP Portal automatically matches all payment files against the established
  DNP data sets. Current DHS usage of the DNP Initiative is more heavily focused on

detail_exs1: "The threats to our homeland have evolved over the 20 years of the Department\
  \ of Homeland Security (DHS). One constant is the legacy of service of our workforce.\
  \ They’ve delivered results for America every day since 2003 and continue to contribute\
  \ to a safer tomorrow for all Americans.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the threat landscape\
  \ has evolved. While we continue to face the threat of international terrorism,\
  \ new threats and challenges have emerged, including increasing incidents of targeted\
  \ violence, cyberattacks and several natural disasters, as well as the unprecedented\
  \ level of migration in our hemisphere. The 260,000-strong DHS workforce uses its\
  \ skills and expertise to meet the challenges of today’s world and prepare for the\
  \ threats of tomorrow, responding with new programs and capabilities, cross-component\
  \ collaboration, and unflinching dedication to the mission.\n\nToday, DHS spans\
  \ over two dozen agencies and offices that work collaboratively to protect the American\
  \ public in the air by securing air travel; on land by securing the border, responding\
  \ to natural disasters, protecting critical infrastructure, and administering our\
  \ nation’s legal immigration system; at sea by protecting our coastline and waterways;\
  \ and in cyberspace by bolstering America’s cyber defense and investigating cybercrime.\n\
  \nIn 2017, the nation faced a historic Atlantic hurricane season. The effects from\
  \ consecutive hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting\
  \ damage across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as\
  \ Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated\
  \ as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for\nDisaster Relief\
  \ Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for\
  \ Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 201 7 (P.L. 11572), and the Further Additional\
  \ Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123)\
  \ were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and\
  \ rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within\
  \ these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation\
  \ amount of $50.72 billion. Per the language of the supplemental appropriations,\
  \ once disaster supplemental funded programs initially met or exceeded the $10 million\
  \ disbursement threshold for payments applicable for Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act (PIIA) review for the 12-month reporting period, the program was deemed susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical sampling\
  \ and reporting. Since the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements\
  \ disbursement activity began, the Department has identified and monitored programs\
  \ that have expended more than $10 million in applicable outlays in any given fiscal\
  \ year (FY).\n\nIn 2020, our Nation faced one of the biggest threats in recent history—the\
  \ COVID-19 pandemic. In a swift response, Congress provided $2 trillion in supplemental\
  \ funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,\
  \ an economic relief package. As the executer of over $45 billion in CARES Act funding,\
  \ DHS was at the epicenter in the Federal Government’s response to the pandemic\
  \ and worked closely with other federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and territorial\
  \ governments to distribute the much-needed funding. In FY 2020, the Federal Emergency\
  \ Management Agency (FEMA) activated the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC)\
  \ in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The NRCC is a multi-agency\
  \ center that coordinates the overall federal support for major incidents and emergencies.\
  \ NRCC also provides a clearinghouse of resources and policies for local and state\
  \ governments in impacted regions.\n\nIn FY 2021, DHS Components received over $50\
  \ billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) with the majority\
  \ allotted to the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is an appropriation used\
  \ to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts\
  \ associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies. In addition, the FEMA\
  \ DRF received over $19 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) to\
  \ carry out disaster relief activity, including COVID-19 related activity. \n\n\
  FEMA provided front-line support for the U.S. response to the pandemic through mass\
  \ vaccination sites and providing coordination across the FEMA regions. The COVID-19\
  \ Pandemic Operational Guidance issued during the 2020 Hurricane Season, outlines\
  \ how FEMA has adapted its response and recovery operations in a COVID-19 environment.\
  \ At the same time, this guidance has other implications moving forward, for example,\
  \ providing a workforce mix for any future scenarios similar to the response during\
  \ this pandemic. The Pandemic Operational Guidance also helps to shape a shared\
  \ understanding among local and regional emergency managers and FEMA about roles\
  \ and expectations in such deployments. The pandemic impacts current and future\
  \ requirements for response and recovery logistics and products, such as determining\
  \ eligible work and costs for non-congregate sheltering in response to a Presidentially\
  \ declared emergency or major disaster, processing grants, how to manage communications,\
  \ and training during such responses, and employing tools requiring limited on-site\
  \ presence—such as satellite imagery—to assess damage.\n\nDue to the burden of testing\
  \ and reporting for the programs impacted heavily by disaster supplemental appropriation\
  \ disbursements, DHS is generally reporting statistical testing results two years\
  \ in arrears. Therefore, FY 2021 disbursement testing and results are reported in\
  \ the 2023 reporting. \n\nWhile supporting the mission, DHS remains strongly committed\
  \ to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability to the American taxpayer\
  \ and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction of improper payments.\
  \ For specifics regarding changes in reporting for specific programs as well as\
  \ program results, please refer to the program level reporting. In comparison to\
  \ prior year reporting, DHS has:\n\na) Removed 5 programs from PIIA Phase 2 reporting,\
  \ effective for the 2023 reporting period as they dropped below the $10 million\
  \ outlay threshold based on FY 2021 disbursement activity and/ or have adequately\
  \ baselined the program under PIIA requirements and have been determined to not\

  \ accordance with instruction received from OMB, for 1 program, based on FY 2021\
  \ disbursement activity. Additional detail has been provided below.\n • FEMA Public\
  \ Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo)\n\nFEMA’s Public Assistance Program provides\
  \ supplemental grants to state, tribal, territorial, and local governments, and\
  \ certain types of private non-profits so communities can quickly respond to and\
  \ recover from major disasters or emergencies. After an event like a hurricane,\
  \ tornado, earthquake or wildfire, communities need help to cover their costs for\
  \ debris removal, life-saving emergency protective measures, and restoring public\
  \ infrastructure. FEMA provides this assistance based on authority in statutes,\
  \ executive orders (EOs), regulations, and policies.\n\nIn 2019, FEMA implemented\
  \ the Validate as You Go (VAYGo) Public Assistance grants payments review process\
  \ for major disaster declarations resulting from the Harvey, Irma, and Maria disasters,\
  \ to comply with statutory improper payment review and reporting requirements to\
  \ significantly reduce project closeout documentation requirements for recipients\
  \ with proven effective internal control processes. In December 2020, FEMA expanded\
  \ VAYGo to all Public Assistance and Fire Management Assistance Grants major disasters\
  \ and emergency declarations beginning with disasters declared in fiscal year 2020.\n\
  \nOn March 13, 2020, the Presidential declaration of a nationwide COVID emergency\
  \ increased the level of federal response from FEMA, as well as support to state,\
  \ local, tribal, and territorial partners across the nation. The agency’s response\
  \ to COVID was unprecedented. When the White House directed FEMA to lead operations,\
  \ COVID became the first national pandemic response that FEMA has led since it was\
  \ established in 1979. It was also the first time in U.S. history the President\
  \ declared a nationwide emergency under Section 501b of the Stafford Act and authorized\
  \ Major Disaster Declarations for all states and territories for the same incident.\
  \ FEMA, through its 10 Regions, managed 57 concurrent Presidential Major Disaster\
  \ Declarations for COVID and worked with 91 tribal nations. \n\nIn April 2022, FEMA\
  \ strategically paused the VAYGo program to conduct listening sessions and identify\
  \ ways to improve the VAYGo testing process. As a result of those listening sessions,\
  \ FEMA published the VAYGo Guide and distributed to Regions and Recipients. This\
  \ guide provides implementation and delivery guidance for the FEMA VAYGo grant payment\
  \ review process and includes details on documentation requirements to support recipient\
  \ drawdowns and financial disbursements. The guidance is designed to enhance the\
  \ customer experience for all stakeholders involved in VAYGo processes while also\
  \ establishing a framework for implementing measures to reduce the administrative\
  \ burden of grants management when improper payment rates meet or fall below the\
  \ minimum threshold established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On\
  \ Aug. 9, 2023, FEMA reinstated VAYGo, which now includes the new implementation\
  \ guide and a new closeout benefit for qualifying recipients.\n\nTo date, FEMA has\
  \ obligated over $70.59 billion dollars for COVID-19 public assistance. This is\
  \ spread to cover over 30 thousand requests for public assistance, over 22 thousand\
  \ eligible applicants, and over 39 thousand active projects. As this specific disaster\
  \ declaration was so wide reaching and impacted so many individuals, the span of\
  \ the public assistance provided is extensive. In order to sufficiently assess the\
  \ appropriateness of these payments, the request for information is broad and often\
  \ takes a substantial amount of time to obtain the necessary documentation and of\
  \ adequate quality and completeness to enable auditability. Therefore, due to the\
  \ impact of the VAYGo strategic pause as well as the significant increase in assessment\
  \ burden, DHS has delayed the PIIA Phase 2 reporting for the FEMA Public Assistance\
  \ - VAYGo program until 2024. This delay in reporting will allow the Department\
  \ to continue to work with Regions and Recipients to obtain the necessary supporting\
  \ documentation and complete an adequate assessment to determine the appropriateness\
  \ of the disbursement activity. DHS remains fully committed to providing transparent\
  \ reporting and this delay will ensure that the reporting is a complete and accurate\
  \ representation of the payment integrity for this program."
