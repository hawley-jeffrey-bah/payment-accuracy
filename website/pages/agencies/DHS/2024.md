Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) - Funeral Assistance
  Themes:
  - Barriers: As the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not have readily
      available access to datasets with information regarding applicant expense incurred
      information, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program is required to rely upon applicant
      submitted required documentation. This barrier serves as a limitation to FEMA
      in improving the prevention of improper payments due to the inability to readily
      match data and information related to Financial eligibility.
    Info: "Per program policy requirements, applicants may only receive financial\
      \ assistance for eligible funeral expenses incurred on or after January 20,\
      \ 2020 and applicants may only receive financial assistance for expenses incurred\
      \ that have not already been covered, paid, and/or reimbursed by other sources.\
      \ As noted in the required documentation, applicants for Funeral Assistance\
      \ must provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with documentation\
      \ demonstrating that funeral expenses had been incurred for the decedent. The\
      \ documentation, such as receipts or funeral home contract, must include all\
      \ of the following information: \na)\tThe applicant’s name indicated as the\
      \ responsible party for the expenses; \nb)\tThe total amount of the funeral\
      \ expenses; \nc)\tThe decedent’s name; and \nd)\tThe date funeral expenses were\
      \ incurred."

  - Barriers: As the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not have readily
      available access to datasets with information regarding benefits received from
      other sources, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program is required to rely upon
      applicant submitted required documentation. This barrier serves as a limitation
      to FEMA in improving the prevention of improper payments due to the inability
      to readily match data and information to Other Sources that may have provided
      similar or duplicate benefits.
    Info: Per program policy requirements, applicants may only receive financial assistance
      for expenses incurred that have not already been covered, paid, and/or reimbursed
      by other sources. As noted in the required documentation, applicants for the
      Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Funeral Assistance must provide FEMA
      with proof of funds received from other sources specifically designated for
      funeral costs. COVID-19 Funeral Assistance may not duplicate burial or funeral
      insurance proceeds, pre-planned or pre-paid funeral contracts, pre-paid trust
      for funeral expenses, irrevocable trust for Medicaid, financial assistance from
      voluntary organizations, government programs or agencies, or any other sources
      specifically designated for funeral expenses. Any eligible COVID-19 Funeral
      Assistance is to be reduced by the amount of other assistance that the applicant
      received for the same expenses.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: Errors, primarily related to administrative processing issues, were
      aligned to the "Failure to Access Data / Information Needed" in accordance with
      the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance. As of October 2024,
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported obligations of $85.2
      billion for COVID-19 public assistance. This is spread to cover over 33,900
      projects and over another 4,000 projects in the review process. For Public Assistance,
      FEMA continues to review and make obligations for applications submitted by
      November 7, 2023, the deadline for project applications, as well as for applicants
      that have received an approved extension beyond this date. As this specific
      disaster, which included 59 disaster declarations over a three-year incident
      period, was so wide reaching and impacted so many individuals, the span of the
      public assistance provided is extensive. In order to sufficiently assess the
      appropriateness of these payments, the request for information is broad and
      often takes a substantial amount of time to obtain the necessary documentation
      of adequate quality and completeness to enable auditability. This barrier related
      to the expansive disaster size and the level of burden to collect the necessary
      supporting documentation serves as a limitation to FEMA in improving the prevention
      of improper payments due to the inability to readily match data and information
      related to Financial eligibility.
    Info: Errors, primarily related to administrative processing issues, were aligned
      to the "Failure to Access Data / Information Needed" in accordance with the
      Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance. Data needed would primarily
      relate to the financial position or status of a beneficiary, recipient, applicant,
      or their family.

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: "The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility\
    \ to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper\
    \ payment, establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with the\
    \ Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and develops and implements\
    \ corrective actions. In previous years, the Department established a two-part\
    \ process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed by a comprehensive assessment\
    \ if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process is used on all programs\
    \ not already reporting an improper payment estimate and that meet the minimum\
    \ disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment process\
    \ is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s\
    \ three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments,\
    \ Component personnel held meetings with program managers, key personnel, and\
    \ other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments. The Department’s\
    \ comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes that directly or\
    \ indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the Government Accountability\
    \ Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control (\"Green Book\") framework as well\
    \ as OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. \n\nAdditionally, the Department\
    \ conducts independent reviews of Component submissions to identify significant\
    \ changes in the program compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of\
    \ the risk ratings. In accordance with OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance,\
    \ programs that are in Phase 2 and are preforming statistical testing and reporting\
    \ do not need to be subject to a risk assessment process and will continue to\
    \ be considered susceptible to significant improper payments until the program\
    \ can be reverted to Phase 1. Once reverted to Phase 1, programs would then be\
    \ subject to the three-year minimum requirement to undergo a DHS comprehensive\
    \ risk assessment."

detail_CAP5: "The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) determined that DHS complied\
  \ with 9 out of 10 Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements.\
  \ The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish improper\
  \ payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) estimates for programs susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement to publish\
  \ IP and UP estimates for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public\
  \ Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program in fiscal year (FY) 2023. \n\n\
  The DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the PIIA related\
  \ to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and unknown payments\
  \ of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring that DHS follows\
  \ the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reporting requirements for programs\
  \ determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C of OMB Circular\
  \ No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time of the OIG\
  \ compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered open and resolved.\
  \ Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions to resolve the\
  \ OIG recommendations:\n•\tDHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment over the\
  \ FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and publish\
  \ an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting. \n•\tDHS will\
  \ follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant program, to include\
  \ describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance for the FEMA\
  \ Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data call for publication\
  \ on PaymentAccuracy.gov. \n\nTo date, DHS has completed assessment over the FY\
  \ 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo\
  \ program and is publishing improper payment error estimates for this 24-month disbursement\
  \ period in the 2024 reporting cycle. As part of the 2024 reporting cycle requirements,\
  \ DHS is providing information describing the actions that the agency has taken\
  \ and/or will take to come into compliance as required per OMB Circular No. A-123,\
  \ Appendix C requirements for a first-year noncompliant program.  Based on the timeline\
  \ for actions to come into compliance, the majority of the associated activities\
  \ are expected to be fully completed in 2024."

detail_ara2_3: "DHS performs regular monitoring and conducts recovery activities throughout\
  \ the year. As such, historical recovery audit efforts indicated that many identified\
  \ overpayments had already been identified by the agency and thus were not applicable\
  \ for recovery audit vendor commission. Given the low return on value for the recovery\
  \ audit vendors, DHS was unsuccessful in keeping a vendor in place for this effort\
  \ in previous years due to cost inefficiency for the vendor and for DHS. \n\nBased\
  \ on additional cost-benefit analysis, DHS has examined the program structures,\
  \ payment types and transaction volume, success rates in recoupment, as well as\
  \ the expected cost incurred examining labor costs, clearance and equipment costs,\
  \ commission payments, etc. Cost analysis reviews conducted to date have not successfully\
  \ determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial for recovery audit\
  \ efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis, and if determined\
  \ to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to move forward with\
  \ establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward."
detail_ara2_3_2: Based on cost benefit analysis conducted in previous year, the recovery
  audit efforts were halted for all DHS programs. In recent years, DHS has worked
  to refresh the cost benefit analysis to ensure that prior decision that recovery
  audits are not cost effective for the Department, or specific entities within the
  Department, remains an accurate position. Cost analysis reviews conducted to date
  have not successfully determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial
  for recovery audit efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis,
  and if determined to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to
  move forward with establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward. Analysis
  has covered all DHS Components, applicable payment types, and programs. Generalized
  results show that given the cost to enter into a recovery audit contract, support
  and administer the contract, provide applicable and necessary documentation, and
  payment of the vendor commission in comparison to the DHS recoupment timeline and
  success rate, the cost to perform the recovery audit efforts has outweighed the
  benefit to the agency for all DHS programs. Please refer to the program listings
  provided related to programs over the $10 million disbursement value and/or related
  to annual risk assessments conducted for additional detail regarding the specific
  DHS programs subject to Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) reporting.

  to, grant and contract closeout processes, Payment Integrity Information Act of
  2019 (PIIA) testing, self-reporting by vendors, duplicate payment reviews, usage
  of Do Not Pay capabilities and monitoring, etc. Although collection methods vary
  by Components and programs, DHS utilizes a broad array of approaches and tools to
  recover overpayments once identified. For programs that utilized Treasury’s Invoice
  Payment Processing (IPP) system, the payment off-set can be utilized to off-set
  the overpayment amount against a to-be paid invoice to the same vendor in the system.
  In addition, the Treasury reclamation process is used once a receivable established
  to recover an overpayment has aged and can be referred for Treasury collection processing.
  DHS widely utilizes the accounts receivable process to generate a receivable that
  then prompts a collection notification process. Notifications and/or dunning letters
  are sent on a prescribed frequency in an attempt to recover the overpayment amount.
  When the above approaches are unsuccessful, there are occasions where legal involvement
  is required that may include a judgement collection and/or a contract suspension.

detail_cap3: Ultimately, the DHS Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the accountable
  official for the progress of the agency coming into compliance with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). As DHS currently does not have a politically
  appointed and confirmed CFO, the accountable official is currently the Deputy Chief
  Financial Officer, Ms. Stacy Marcott.
detail_cap4: "The goals and requirements of the Payment Integrity Information Act\
  \ of 2019 (PIIA) are communicated to all levels of staff throughout the Office of\
  \ the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office and procurement staff.\
  \ The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable\
  \ officers – including Component Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) – programs, and\
  \ states and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper\
  \ payments. \n\nIn addition, the Department’s CFO, Deputy CFO, and senior staff\
  \ have performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship\
  \ incorporated into their annual performance plans. As a strong internal control\
  \ environment is the best way to prevent and detect improper payments, Component\
  \ managers are responsible for completing internal control work on payment processing\
  \ as part of the Department’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No.\
  \ A-123 efforts. They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient\
  \ internal controls, including a control environment that prevents improper payments\
  \ from being made, effectively managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting\
  \ and recovering improper payments that may occur.\n\nPerformance requirements related\
  \ to PIIA requirements are included in each DHS Component CFO annual performance\
  \ plan. Execution against these requirements is evaluated and measured as part of\
  \ the end of year performance review. Per this review, the performance against established\
  \ requirements, each Component CFO is evaluated to determine whether he/she did\
  \ not meet, met, or exceeded performance expectations which then attributes to annual\
  \ incentives (i.e., awards, recognition, etc.) or consequences (i.e., improvement\
  \ plan, reassignment, etc.) if there are repeated instances where performance deficiencies\
  \ are noted."

detail_dpa5: "Across the Department, many DHS Components utilize the Do Not Pay (DNP)\
  \ Initiative to assist in preventing and detecting improper payments. Primary use\
  \ is focused during the “At the Time of Payment” stage in the payment lifecycle.\
  \ Any funds disbursed by the Department of Treasury go through Payment Integration,\
  \ in which the DNP Portal automatically matches all payment files against the established\
  \ DNP datasets. Current DHS usage of the DNP Initiative is more heavily focused\
  \ on detecting potential payment issues versus prevention. \n\nBased on the DHS\
  \ usage of DNP in fiscal year (FY) 2024, there were 12 DHS Components had their\
  \ payment data reviewed against the DNP datasets which have been vetted against\
  \ Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File (DMF), American InfoSource\

detail_exs1: "In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed\
  \ the Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296), which established the Department of\
  \ Homeland Security (DHS) and combined the functions of 22 Federal departments and\
  \ agencies with broad responsibilities to secure the Nation from threats. Since\
  \ its inception, the Department has evolved into the third largest Cabinet agency\
  \ and has matured its mission areas to collectively prevent attacks, mitigate threats,\
  \ respond to national emergencies, and preserve economic security. The threats to\
  \ our homeland have evolved over the 21 years of the Department of Homeland Security.\
  \ One constant is the legacy of service of our workforce. They’ve delivered results\
  \ for America every day since 2003 and continue to contribute to a safer tomorrow\
  \ for all Americans. \n\nWhile we continue to face the threat of international terrorism,\
  \ new threats and challenges have emerged, including increasing incidents of targeted\
  \ violence, cyberattacks and several natural disasters, as well as the unprecedented\
  \ level of transnational organized crime in our hemisphere. The 260,000-strong DHS\
  \ workforce uses its skills and expertise to meet the challenges of today’s world\
  \ and prepare for the threats of tomorrow, responding with new programs and capabilities,\
  \ cross-Component collaboration, and unflinching dedication to the mission: to secure\
  \ the nation from the many threats we face. Today, DHS spans over two dozen agencies\
  \ and offices that work collaboratively to protect the American public in the air\
  \ by securing air travel; on land by securing the border, responding to natural\
  \ disasters, protecting critical infrastructure, and administering our nation’s\
  \ legal immigration system; at sea by protecting our coastline and waterways; and\
  \ in cyberspace by bolstering America’s cyber defense and investigating cybercrime.\
  \ As the complex threat environment continues to evolve and loom, the Department\
  \ will embody the relentless resilience of the American people to ensure a safe,\
  \ secure, and prosperous Homeland supported by the six overarching homeland security\
  \ missions that make up our strategic plan: \n\n1.\tCounter Terrorism and Homeland\
  \ Security Threats \n2.\tSecure United States (U.S.) Borders and Approaches \n3.\t\
  Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure \n4.\tPreserve and Uphold the Nation's\
  \ Prosperity and Economic Security \n5.\tStrengthen Preparedness and Resilience\
  \ \n6.\tChampion the DHS Workforce and Strengthen the Department \n\nWe face more\
  \ serious threats from nation states now than at any time in the Department's history.\
  \ DHS is bringing together its authorities and capabilities across DHS Component\
  \ agencies to counter those threats, including enforcing U.S. trade laws banning\
  \ the importation of goods made, wholly or in part, with forced labor, strengthening\
  \ maritime governance, and increasing awareness of nation state threats with our\
  \ federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. The nation\
  \ also faces threats from the impacts of climate change causing more frequent and\
  \ severe weather events, and from emerging infectious diseases. \n\nIn 2017, the\
  \ nation faced a historic Atlantic hurricane season. The effects from consecutive\
  \ hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting damage\
  \ across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as Puerto\
  \ Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated\
  \ as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief\
  \ Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56), the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for\
  \ Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-72), and the Further Additional\
  \ Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123)\
  \ were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and\
  \ rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within\
  \ these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation\
  \ amount of $50.72 billion. Per the language of the supplemental appropriations,\
  \ once disaster supplemental funded programs initially met or exceeded the $10 million\
  \ disbursement threshold for payments applicable for Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act of 2019 (PIIA) review for the 12-month reporting period, the program was deemed\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical\
  \ sampling and reporting. Since the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief\
  \ Requirements disbursement activity began, the Department has identified and monitored\
  \ programs that have expended more than $10 million in applicable outlays in any\
  \ given fiscal year (FY). \n\nIn 2020, our Nation faced one of the biggest threats\
  \ in recent history—the COVID-19 pandemic. In a swift response, Congress provided\
  \ $2 trillion in supplemental funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\
  \ Security (CARES) Act, an economic relief package. As the executer of over $45\
  \ billion in CARES Act funding, DHS was at the epicenter in the Federal Government’s\
  \ response to the pandemic and worked closely with other federal agencies, state,\
  \ local, tribal, and territorial governments to distribute the much-needed funding.\
  \ In FY 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated the National\
  \ Response Coordination Center (NRCC) in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in\
  \ the United States. The NRCC is a multi-agency center that coordinates the overall\
  \ federal support for major incidents and emergencies. NRCC also provides a clearinghouse\
  \ of resources and policies for local and state governments in impacted regions.\
  \ \n\nIn FY 2021, DHS Components received over $50 billion in funding from the American\
  \ Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) with the majority allotted to the FEMA Disaster Relief\
  \ Fund (DRF). The DRF is an appropriation used to direct, coordinate, manage, and\
  \ fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters\
  \ and emergencies. In addition, the FEMA DRF received over $19 billion from the\
  \ Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) to carry out disaster relief activity, including\
  \ COVID-19 related activity. \n\nFEMA provided front-line support for the U.S. response\
  \ to the pandemic through mass vaccination sites and providing coordination across\
  \ the FEMA regions. The COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance issued during the\
  \ 2020 Hurricane Season, outlines how FEMA has adapted its response and recovery\
  \ operations in a COVID-19 environment. At the same time, this guidance has other\
  \ implications moving forward, for example, providing a workforce mix for any future\
  \ scenarios similar to the response during this pandemic. The Pandemic Operational\
  \ Guidance also helps to shape a shared understanding among local and regional emergency\
  \ managers and FEMA about roles and expectations in such deployments. The pandemic\
  \ impacts current and future requirements for response and recovery logistics and\
  \ products, such as determining eligible work and costs for non- congregate sheltering\
  \ in response to a Presidentially declared emergency or major disaster, processing\
  \ grants, how to manage communications, and training during such responses, and\
  \ employing tools requiring limited on-site presence—such as satellite imagery—to\
  \ assess damage. \n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123,\
  \ Appendix C, “Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement”, serves as the implementing\
  \ guidance to ensure that legislative requirements within PIIA are sufficiently\
  \ addressed. Per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, agencies should assess all\
  \ programs with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk\
  \ at least once every three years to determine whether the total annual Improper\
  \ Payments (IPs) plus Unknown Payments (UPs) collectively for each program are likely\
  \ to be above or below the statutory threshold for the given year. As part of the\
  \ DHS risk assessment process, all programs are subject to a preliminary risk assessment\
  \ which serves to determine if the program has been subject to significant changes,\
  \ fluctuations, new requirements, etc. that could have substantially altered the\
  \ program’s susceptibility to making significant improper payments, even in off-cycle\
  \ years. If the preliminary risk assessment indicates a need to reassess the risk\
  \ of the program or if the program is due for an updated assessment due to the three-year\
  \ frequency cycle, DHS will then move the program into the comprehensive risk assessment\
  \ process. In 2024, DHS completed a comprehensive risk assessment for 48 programs\
  \ out of the over 90 programs that exceeded $10 million in annual outlays. Upon\
  \ completion of the comprehensive risk assessment process, only one program was\
  \ determined to be newly susceptible to significant improper payments and will be\
  \ converted to Phase 2 for statistical testing and reporting in 2025. \n\nDue to\
  \ the burden of testing and reporting for the programs impacted heavily by disaster\
  \ supplemental appropriation disbursements, DHS is generally reporting statistical\
  \ testing results two years in arrears. While supporting the mission, DHS remains\
  \ strongly committed to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability to\
  \ the American taxpayer and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction\
  \ of improper payments. For specifics regarding changes in reporting for specific\
  \ programs as well as program results, please refer to the program level reporting.\
  \ In comparison to prior year reporting, DHS has: \n\na)\tRemoved one program from\
  \ PIIA Phase 2 reporting as the program has been adequately baselined under PIIA\
  \ requirements and has been determined to not be susceptible to significant improper\
  \ payments and thus reverted to PIIA Phase 1, effective for the 2024 reporting period.\n\
  •\tFEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) – Disaster Supplemental Funds \n\n\
  b)\tContinued PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one program, based on FY 2022 disbursement\
  \ activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.\n•\tU.S. Customs and Border\
  \ Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster\
  \ Supplemental Funds\n\nc)\tAdded one program into PIIA Phase 2 reporting based\
  \ on FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.\n•\t\
  FEMA Funeral Assistance \n\nd)\tInitiated catch-up PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one\
  \ program, to cover FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the\
  \ 2024 reporting period. \n•\tFEMA Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo)\
  \ \n\ne)\tDetermined one program has met the criteria per the agency’s risk assessment\
  \ process to be deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus will\
  \ be moved to Phase 2 for the 2025 reporting period.\n•\tImmigration and Customs\
  \ Enforcement (ICE) PC&I – Disaster Supplemental Funds\n\nFor the 2024 reporting\
  \ of Phase 2 programs, DHS is publishing an improper payment estimates for a total\
  \ of three programs. All program disbursement activity subject to assessment and\
  \ reporting in 2024 included outlay activity from FY 2022 but due to the delay in\
  \ FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo reporting in the prior year, that program is publishing\
  \ 24-month assessment coverage and error reporting to also include coverage for\
  \ disbursements made in FY 2021. Overall, DHS conducted assessments over more than\
  \ $41.4 billion in disbursement activity with over 96 percent of disbursements being\
  \ deemed proper. As such, DHS is reporting an agency-wide error rate of approximately\
  \ 3.84 percent in 2024. As highlighted in the program specific reporting, the FEMA\
  \ Public Assistance – VAYGo program accounts for just under 96 percent of the disbursement\
  \ amount that was reviewed by the agency and contributed to just over 96 percent\
  \ of the DHS total IP and UP reported totals. The primary root causes for errors\
  \ identified during the 2024 assessment and reporting period were:\n•\tUnable to\
  \ Determine whether the Payment is Proper or Improper due to Insufficient Documentation\
  \ (categorized as Unknown Payments) – estimated error amount of just under $1.4\
  \ billion accounting for over 87 percent of the total DHS reported error rate\n\
  •\tFailure to Access Data or Information (categorized as Improper Payments) – estimated\
  \ error amount of just under $195.3 million accounting for over 12 percent of the\
  \ total DHS reported error rate \n\nTo address the issues surrounding insufficient\
  \ documentation, FEMA continues to work with recipients and applicants on obtaining\
  \ additional information and missing documentation for the UPs. FEMA remains committed\
  \ to streamlining and automating the program processes, training relevant parties\
  \ and stakeholders, ensuring that policy and process documentation is current and\
  \ available, and maintaining consistent and regular oversight through internal reviews\
  \ and audit activity while not overburdening grant recipients and assistance applicants.\
  \ With the two major programs contributing solely to the 2024 estimated error rates\
  \ for the agency, please refer to the program level reporting for the FEMA Public\
  \ Assistance – VAYGo program and the FEMA Funeral Assistance program for additional\
  \ detail regarding granular root causes, corrective actions taken, corrective actions\
  \ planned, and for additional context related to the payment environment and integrity\
  \ of the program. \n\nFinally, in 2024 the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)\
  \ completed its evaluation to determine the Department’s compliance with PIIA requirements\
  \ based off of the FY 2023 reporting. The DHS OIG determined that DHS complied with\
  \ 9 out of 10 PIIA requirements and did not have any programs reporting above the\
  \ statutory threshold. The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement\
  \ to publish IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper\
  \ payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement to publish IP\
  \ and UP estimates for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program in FY 2023 due\
  \ to the delay in PIIA reporting, highlighted above. \n\nThe DHS OIG made two recommendations\
  \ to improve DHS's compliance with the PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and\
  \ reporting of improper payments and unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance\
  \ – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring that DHS follows the OMB reporting requirements\
  \ for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C of\
  \ OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time\
  \ of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered\
  \ open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions\
  \ to resolve the OIG recommendations: \n•\tDHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment\
  \ over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program\
  \ and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting.\n\
  •\tDHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant program, to\
  \ include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance for the\
  \ FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data call for\
  \ publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. \n\nBased on the timeline for actions to come\
  \ into compliance, the majority of the associated activities are expected to be\
  \ fully completed in the FY 2024 PIIA reporting cycle."

detail_raa9: "The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility\
  \ to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper payment,\
  \ establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with the Office of\
  \ Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and develops and implements corrective actions.\
  \ In previous years, the Department established a two-part process comprised of\

  \ of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment process is required based on\
  \ the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s three-year risk assessment\
  \ cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments, Component personnel held\
  \ meetings with program managers, key personnel, and other stakeholders to discuss\
