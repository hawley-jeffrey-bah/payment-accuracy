detail_agy1: Based on prior financial statement audits, a determination of strong
  internal controls from CSOSA internal controls testing, and the results of CSOSA
  internal testing of its FY 2023 payment transactions, CSOSA believes that the CSP
  and PSA programs have low inherent risks of improper payment.

detail_ara2_3: To employ one GS 12 FTE to perform recapture audits will cost $93K
  to $122K per year. Given that the CSOSA has a very low risk of improper payment
  as a result of risk assessments done in FY2023, it is not cost beneficial for the
  CSOSA to employ an FTE to perform recapture audits. Another option is to contract
  out the recapture audits, below is a cost analysis using GSA contract rates for
  Castro & Company, LLC. Based on the analysis below, it would cost CSOSA at least
  $41K to recapture any improper payments. It is our determination then that it is
  not cost beneficial for the CSOSA to employ a contractor to perform recapture audits.
detail_ara2_3_2: CSOSA consists of two component programs, the Community Supervision
  Program (CSP), supervising adult offenders on probation, parole and supervised release,
  and the Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), supervising defendants on pretrial release.

detail_dpa5: 'CSOSA and its financial system service provider, the Department of Interior-Interior
  Business Center (IBC), use the DNP Initiative to review payment eligibility for
  purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments. The DNP Validation is
  completed each weekend. The IBC receives an email from DNP notifying them that the
  Continuous Monitoring results are refreshed. The IBC will refresh the OFF report
  data the first workday of the week. IBC sends an email notification immediately
  after the data is made available. Upon receipt of this email notification, CSOSA
  Office of Financial Management (OFM) will run the OFF Report and format based on
  the three available reports: Matched to Vendor, Matched Vendors Tied to PO, and
  Matched Vendors Tied to AP. The three identified reports include vendors with matched
  results of “Possible”, “Probable”, and “Conclusive”. The information reported to

  the CSOSA Office of Procurement (Procurement) is based on those vendors with a “Conclusive”
  match result. OFM issues an email to Procurement on a weekly basis identifying those
  vendors who appeared on the DNP Report. Prior to submitting a new OFF Vendor Request
  form, the Agency must ensure the vendor is not referenced on the DNP List. The information
  is provided weekly by email to all credit cardholders to ensure they are not using
  any vendors identified on the DNP Report. CSOSA Accounts Payable staff are informed
  of this information as it pertains to reposting monthly bank statements and Budget
  Analysts are informed as well to assist them when approving requisitions. Prior
  to submitting a new Vendor Request form, CSOSA must ensure the vendor is not referenced
  on the DNP List. OFM informs IBC to end date positively identified vendors in OFF
  via email. CSOSA has neither identified a material amount nor realized a reduction
  of improper payments attributable to implementing the DNP Initiative capabilities.
  Rather, CSOSA’s DNP Initiative implementation has proven that CSOSA has robust and
  effective internal controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal
  funds.'
detail_exs1: CSOSA was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019
  (PIIA). CSOSA maintains payment integrity through strong payment controls and continuous
  monitoring. CSOSA is in the second year of the assessment cycle.  CSOSA performs
  risk assessments at least once every three years.  The agency is considered to be
  in Phase 1 and is not likely to have an annual amount of improper payments (IP)
  plus annual unknown payments (UP) above the statutory threshold.  The risk of improper
  payments has been low over the years as well as during the testing performed during
  the most recent risk assessment.  Business processes have not changed during this
  cycle and the risk remains low.
