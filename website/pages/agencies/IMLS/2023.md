detail_exs1: The Improper Payment Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) and subsequent amendments
  including the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, requires agencies to review
  all programs and activities they administer to identify those that may be susceptible
  to significant erroneous payments.  In FY 2023, IMLS had no grant programs that
  were considered susceptible to significant erroneous payments or qualify as “risk
  susceptible” based on OMB guidance thresholds.
