detail_dpa5: NLRB uses the do not pay initiative that provides services and support
  activities related to the prevention and detection of improper payments.  NLRB's
  improper payments are on the low.
detail_exs1: "The PIIA (the Payment Integrity and Information Act) amends government-wide\
  \ improper payment reporting requirements by repealing and replacing the Improper\
  \ Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), the Improper Payments Elimination and\
  \ Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act\
  \ of 2012 (IPERIA), and the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA).\
  \ \n\nThe Agency is required by the PIIA to assess the disbursement process and\
  \ estimate the approximate amount of improper payments every three years. The Agency’s\
  \ latest IPIA assessment and review performed by an independent consultant in FY\
  \ 2022 concluded that the NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper\
  \ payments. \n\nFor FY 2023, NLRB processed $285,701,520 in disbursements which\
  \ included payroll and benefits of $233,880,801 and travel of $1,122,109.  In addition,\
  \ the NLRB paid $50,698,610 to vendors which accounted for 18 percent of the total\
  \ disbursements. \n\nThe Agency’s independent review evaluated the procedures in\
  \ the Agency’s payment and disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed the\
  \ design and effectiveness of internal controls. Given these controls, the IPIA\
  \ assessment found no improper payment in the testing and found that the estimated\
  \ improper payments to be within the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper\
  \ payments for the NLRB’s programs did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of\
  \ the program total expenditures or $100 million of the total program expenditures.\
  \ The Agency estimates the improper payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and\
  \ the improper payment amount to be no more than $4,285,523. Therefore, the NLRB\
  \ has effective procedures and controls in place for its payment and disbursement\
  \ processes. The NLRB has reasonable assurance that controls over financial and\
  \ non-financial operations are sufficient. No additional reporting requirements\
  \ are necessary.\n"

detail_pcp14: 'The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concurred with the determination
  that the NLRB does not have significant improper payments.

  The PIIA also requires that an agency perform an improper payment risk assessment
  every 3 years. The NLRB complied with this requirement as the NLRB’s last improper
  payment risk assessment was conducted in October 2022. When the OIG reviewed the
  assessment, they observed that it correctly reported on two program areas – payroll
  and commercial contracts. For purposes of the improper payment assessment, backpay
  payments are not subject to PIIA as they are not a payment of Federal funds.'
