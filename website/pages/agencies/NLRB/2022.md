detail_agy1: "The PIIA amends government-wide improper payment reporting requirements\
  \ by repealing and replacing the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA),\
  \ the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), the Improper\
  \ Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2012 (IPERIA), and the Fraud Reduction\
  \ and Data Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDAA).\n\nFor FY 2022, $281,235,483 in disbursements\
  \ were made, of which payroll, benefits, and travel accounted for $223,253,052,\
  \ and $525,092 were disbursed. Additionally, the NLRB paid $57,457,338 to vendors\
  \ for about 20% of the total disbursements.\n\nThe Agency’s latest IPIA assessment,\
  \ for FY 2022, and review performed by an independent consultant concluded that\
  \ the NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper payments.\n\n\
  During FY 2022, the Agency performed an independent review that evaluated the procedures\
  \ in the Agency’s payment and disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed\
  \ the design and effectiveness of controls. Given these controls, the IPIA assessment\
  \ found no improper payment in the testing and found that the estimated improper\
  \ payments to be within the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper payments\
  \ for the NLRB’s programs did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of the program\
  \ total expenditures or $100 million of the total program expenditures. The Agency\
  \ estimates the improper payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and the improper\
  \ payment amount to be no more than $4,218,532.24. \nTherefore, the NLRB has effective\
  \ procedures and controls in place for its payment and disbursement processes. The\
  \ NLRB has reasonable assurance that controls over financial and non-financial operations\
  \ are sufficient. No additional reporting requirements are necessary.\n\nIn FY 2022,\
  \ the DNP portal vetted 5,548 payments for authenticity and validity. The number\
  \ of payments made amounted to $36,824,490.08 in disbursements that passed through\
  \ DNP’s network of red flag indicating systems. As a result, DNP identified three\
  \ payments totaling $28,080.84 that required further review because of a death record\
  \ match. DNP did not identify any payments which matched a vendor name on the Excluded\
  \ Parties List (EPL).\n\n· Payments reviewed for improper payments includes the\
  \ total number of payments disbursed by the Agency through the Payments, Claims\
  \ and Enhanced Reconciliation (PACER) payment system minus any payments that were\
  \ excluded from matching due to (1) a missing or unmatchable TIN (DMF only) or (2)\
  \ a missing name.\n\n· Payments stopped is currently not applicable since the DNP\
  \ matching and adjudication process is based on post payment results.\n\n· Improper\
  \ payments reviewed and not stopped includes the total number of matches identified\
  \ by the DNP Initiative that were adjudicated as proper by the Agency."

detail_dpa5: The mission of the Treasury’s DNP team is to “protect the integrity of
  the government’s payment process by assisting agencies in mitigating and eliminating
  improper payments in a cost-effective manner while safeguarding the privacy of individuals.”
  The NLRB echoes that sentiment and has made eliminating improper payments one of
  the Agency’s financial management priorities. The DNP portal is a multifaceted system
  that embraces resources from several agency subsystems i.e., Social Security Administration’s
  Death Master File, GSA’s System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusion Records as
  well as the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). DNP uses this network of systems in order
  to disseminate to agencies who should or should not receive public funds in order
  to reduce or prevent the likelihood of improper payments
