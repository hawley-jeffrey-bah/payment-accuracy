detail_agy1: Maintaining a strong control environment is a top priority for NSF in
  monitoring and mitigating improper payments risk. NSF systematically identifies
  and assesses risks, including improper payments susceptibility as a cornerstone
  of its internal control program.

detail_ara2_3: NSF does not conduct recovery audits.  OMB agreed with NSF's analysis
  that it would not be cost effective for the agency to conduct a recovery audit program.  No
  circumstances have changed within any of NSF's programs that require an additional
  recovery audit cost-effectiveness analysis.

  of questioned costs identified in audit reports, agency post-payment reviews, and
  other remittances received during normal payment operations.  Not all remittances
  that NSF receives through normal payment operations are considered overpayments
  as defined in PIIA.  However, NSF includes all of these operational remittances
  in its overpayments identified and recovered totals for completeness.  For audit
  resolution and agency post-payment reviews, NSF uses electronic notices/letters
  to identify and recover overpayments identified through these specific recovery
  activities.'

  format and are screened against the following data sources: Social Security Death
  Master File (DMF) [public information] and the GSA System for Award Management (SAM)
  Exclusion Records [restricted information]. Any subsequent matches are viewable
  in Treasury’s DNP online portal for adjudication purposes. There were 2 positive
  DNP matches for payments that NSF issued in FY 2022, however, NSF adjudicated both
  of these as false positives and were not improper payments.'
detail_exs1: NSF has one mission program of Grants and Cooperative Agreements and
  three other mission-related activities – Contracts and Individual Payments, NSF
  Purchase Cards and Payments to Employees.  NSF conducts risk assessments for all
  programs with outlays over $10M on a three-year risk assessment cycle. The most
  recent risk assessment was performed in FY 2021, which concluded that the agency
  does not have any programs which are likely to be susceptible to significant improper
  payments.  Based on NSF’s risk assessment, all of these programs and activities
  are considered Phase I in accordance with Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019
  (PIIA).  NSF will conduct its next PIIA risk assessment in FY 2024.  Please note
  that NSF Purchase Cards did not have outlays over the $10M threshold for FY 2021
  and as such were excluded from the risk assessment.
