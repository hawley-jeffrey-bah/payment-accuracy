detail_agy1: Maintaining a strong control environment is a top priority for NSF in
  monitoring and mitigating improper payments risk.  NSF systematically identifies
  and assesses risks, including improper payment susceptibility as a cornerstone of
  its internal control program.

detail_ara2_3: NSF does not conduct recovery audits.  OMB agreed with NSF's analysis
  that it would not be cost effective for the agency to conduct a recovery audit program.  No
  circumstances have changed within any of NSF's programs that require an additional
  recovery audit cost-effectiveness analysis.

  that NSF receives through normal payment operations are considered overpayments
  as defined in PIIA. However, NSF includes all of these operational remittances in
  its overpayments identified and recovered totals for completeness. For audit resolution
  and agency post-payment reviews, NSF uses electronic notices/letters to identify

  Exclusion Records [restricted information]. Any subsequent matches are viewable

detail_exs1: NSF has one mission program of Grants and Cooperative Agreements for
  its financial assistance portfolio and three other mission support activities –
  Contracts and Individual Payments, NSF Purchase Cards and Payments to Employees.
  NSF conducts risk assessments for all programs with outlays over $10M on a three-year
  risk assessment cycle.  The most recent risk assessment was performed in FY 2021,
  which concluded that the agency does not have any programs which are likely to be
  susceptible to significant improper payments. Based on NSF’s risk assessment, all
  of these programs and activities are considered Phase I in accordance with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). NSF will conduct its next PIIA risk assessment
  in FY 2024.  In FY 2023, NSF Purchase Card outlays were below the $10M threshold.  NSF
  is continuing to monitor NSF Purchase Card outlays in preparation for the FY 2024
  assessment.
