detail_agy1: "The identification of improper payments associated with awards GNTCP18AL0064\
  \ and GT3CP22AL0001 highlights the agency's commitment to maintaining rigorous standards\
  \ of payment integrity. Proper Payment Integrity Reporting is essential to uphold\
  \ transparency, accountability, and compliance with federal guidelines.\n\nThese\
  \ discrepancies were identified through the Council’s strong internal control mechanisms,\
  \ which include:\n•\tRegular Federal Financial Report (FFR) Reviews: Comprehensive\
  \ reviews of the FFR and supporting documentation ensure that payments are accurate,\
  \ allowable, and align with the grant terms.\n•\tDetailed Supporting Documentation\
  \ Analysis: Supporting documents, such as cost summaries and settlement closing\
  \ statements, are meticulously examined to validate expenditures.\n•\tPrompt Corrective\
  \ Actions: Upon identifying improper payments, ADCNR has demonstrated a swift response,\
  \ including reimbursement, reallocation, and recovery measures, adhering to federal\
  \ payment integrity requirements.\n\nTo further strengthen payment integrity, the\
  \ Council is committed to :\n•\tEnhanced Training: Providing staff with additional\
  \ training on federal grant compliance and allowable costs.\n•\tOngoing Monitoring:\
  \ Increasing the frequency of tier reviews to detect and mitigate improper payments\
  \ earlier in the grant lifecycle.\n•\tReporting and Transparency: Continuing to\
  \ submit comprehensive reports on any identified discrepancies and corrective actions\
  \ to relevant oversight bodies, ensuring full transparency.\n"

detail_ara2_3: In accordance with the guidelines set forth in A-123 Appendix C, it
  is required for agencies to perform recapture audits for programs and activities
  that have an annual expenditure of $1 million or more, as long as conducting such
  audits proves to be cost-effective. After careful consideration, the Restore Council
  has determined that conducting payment recapture audits would not be a cost-effective
  endeavor. This decision is based on the historical data showing a low occurrence
  of improper payments and the fact that the costs associated with conducting a formal
  recapture audit outweigh the benefits.

  \ (FFR), supporting documentation resulted in the identification of disallowed costs,\
  \ deemed as improper payments associated with FAIN GNTCP18AL0064 totaling $68,023.45,\
  \ and FAIN GT3CP22AL0001 totaling $9,400.00.\n\nImproper Payments GNTCP18AL0064\n\
  The improper payments totaling $68,023.45 are divided into the following two categories:\n\
  \n1) Payments totaling $44,372.23 that were determined to be unallowable costs on\
  \ award GNTCP18AL0064 and resulted in improper payment that must be reimbursed to\
  \ the Council.\n\n2) Payments totaling $23,651.22 that were determined to be unallowable\
  \ on award GNTCP18AL0064 but were however, allowable to be transferred to a different\
  \ Bucket 2 or Bucket 3 award.\n\nAs requested, ADCNR submitted remittance to the\
  \ Council for the $44,372.23 in disallowed costs. Book entry adjustments to transfer\
  \ the $23,651.22 in allowable costs to the appropriate grant awards will be conducted\
  \ in ASAP during Q1 of FY25.\n\n\nImproper Payment GT3CP22AL0001\nAn improper payment\
  \ of $9,400 was identified on ADCNR award GT3CP22AL0001 in conjunction with a land\
  \ acquisition transition for purchase.\n\nThe final appraisal value of $2,416,000\
  \ was $9,400 below the purchase agreement between ADCNR and the seller. During pre-acquisition\
  \ discussions, Council staff approved $2,416,000 in RESTORE funds in alignment with\
  \ the appraised value and ADCNR agreed that the $9,400 difference would be paid\
  \ using additional state funds. \nReview of post-acquisition documentation provided\
  \ by ADCNR, identified a discrepancy between the ASAP drawdown on 7/12/2024 and\
  \ the amount of RESTORE funds approved for land acquisition closing. Based on the\
  \ documentation, ADCNR requested an ASAP draw on 7/12/2024 of $2,431,583.52 and\
  \ issued a check on 7/15/2024 for the full amount. This created an improper payment\
  \ of $9,400.\n\nCouncil staff are working with ADCNR to resolve the issue and recover\
  \ the $9,400 in funds improperly paid.\n\n"

  This includes a weekly run that identifies active suppliers who should not be paid

  and cannot be used.
detail_exs1: 'The Restore Council conducts risk assessments for all programs that
  have outlays over $10M on a three-year risk assessment cycle. The most recent risk
  assessment was performed in fiscal year 2022 and concluded that the agency does
  not have any programs that are likely to be susceptible to significant improper
  payments. The agency plans to conduct its next PIIA risk assessment in the fiscal
  year 2025.


  The Treasury Office of the Inspector General audit for the fiscal year 2023 has
  determined that the Restore Council was compliant with the requirements outlined
  in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).
