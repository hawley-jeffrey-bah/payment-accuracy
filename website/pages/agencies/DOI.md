Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The Department has moved away from using an equally weighted
    qualitative factor approach when assessing each DOI and OMB risk factor. Instead,
    the Department now utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing each factor,
    as noted within Appendix C. Any risk-weighting adjustment(s) may vary year over
    year and will be dependent on the current payment integrity operating environment,
    managements discretion, and risk management functions.

detail_ara2_3: In FY 2014, the DOI conducted payment recapture audits for payments
  made in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 that resulted in a recapture rate of 0.0004
  percent. Based on the low rate of improper payments, DOI concluded that the cost
  of executing a payment recapture audit program outweighed the benefits of finding
  and recovering erroneous payments. The staff resources needed to conduct the program,
  sustain the contract, and oversee vendor payments were a significant drain on limited
  agency resources with minimal benefits to the government. In April 2014, OMB was
  notified that DOI discontinued the payment recapture audit program. The DOI continues
  to have a low improper payment rate and circumstances have not changed within our
  programs to make a payment recapture audit cost effective. As such, DOI did not
  perform recapture audits for improper payments this fiscal year. The DOI will continue
  complying with PIIA through the OMB Circular A-123 process as a more cost effective
  and efficient use of agency resources to identify, reduce, and recover improper
  payments.

  Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service to strengthen pre-and-post payment monitoring
  efforts by identifying areas for improvement. As part of this initiative, the Department
  worked with Treasury to submit a request for access to additional data sources within
  the DNP Portal to enhance preventive controls. The Department also maintains ongoing
  communication with Bureaus and Offices, emphasizing the importance of using the
  DNP Portal to verify eligibility across various data sources, ensuring that vendors,
  grantees, loan recipients, and beneficiaries are qualified to receive federal payments.
detail_exs1: "On March 5, 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued an\
  \ update to Appendix C of Circular A-123 (Appendix C) in OMB Memorandum M-21-19\
  \ Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. Appendix C requires agencies to\
  \ review all programs and activities for the risk of improper payment by performing\
  \ assessments to determine whether those programs are “susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments.” In accordance with PIIA, DOI conducts comprehensive risk assessments\
  \ on a three-year cycle of all agency programs with payments greater than $10 million\
  \ during the assessment period (In Cycle Risk Assessment). With OMB concurrence,\
  \ DOI utilizes an alternative annual assessment period from quarter 4 of the prior\
  \ fiscal year through quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. \n\nIn FY 2023, DOI\
  \ performed an Out-of-Cycle risk assessment of fourteen (14) programs, including\
  \ new programs and those with significant changes (e.g. legislation, changes in\
  \ funding levels, etc.), totaling approximately $2.1 billion in payments for the\
  \ assessment period of Quarter 4 of FY 2022 through Quarter 3 of FY 2023 (assessment\
  \ period). This year (FY 2024), the OIG performed an inspection of the U.S. Department\
  \ of the Interior’s Compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019\
  \ in Its Fiscal Year 2023 Agency Financial Report and determined that the Department\
  \ complied with PIIA for FY 2023. However, noted that the risk assessment conducted\
  \ for one of the 14 programs assessed in FY 2023 did not accurately evaluate qualitative\
  \ factors. While this issue did not affect the Department’s overall compliance the\
  \ OIG cautioned that inaccurately completing risk assessments could lead to an incorrect\
  \ assessment of risk of improper payments in the future. As a result, the OIG made\
  \ one (1) recommendation in FY 2024 for the Department to establish and implement\
  \ a uniform training program for all improper payment risk assessors that provides\
  \ comprehensive guidance on appropriate assessment of all required risk factors.\
  \ \n\nDuring FY 2024, the Department implemented corrective actions in response\
  \ to the FY 2024 recommendation issued by the OIG. This involved developing and\
  \ conducting an Improper Payment Integrity Training Program for all personnel involved\
  \ in conducting, reviewing, and/or approving improper payment risk assessments.\
  \ The Department will continue to require this training annually to develop accurate\
  \ and effective risk assessments and identify programs who are susceptible to being\
  \ at high risk for improper payments. \n\n\nIn FY 2025, the Department will conduct\
  \ an In-Cycle risk assessment, requiring all DOI programs with annual outlays greater\
  \ than $10 million to undergo a risk evaluation. If any DOI programs are found to\
  \ be susceptible to significant improper payments during that assessment, they will\
  \ proceed to Phase 2 testing in FY 2026, as mandated by PIIA.\n\nIn FY 2024, the\
  \ Department identified a rise in overpayments through internal control reviews,\
  \ surpassing the amounts reported in FY 2023. Consequently, the Department recovered\
  \ greater sums, reflecting the larger overpayments discovered during the year."

detail_pcp14: As noted by OIG in the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Compliance
  with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 in Its Fiscal Year 2023 Agency

  2023. However, noted that the risk assessment conducted for one of the 14 programs

detail_raa9: The Department has moved away from using an equally weighted qualitative
  factor approach when assessing each DOI and OMB risk factor. Instead, the Department
  now utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing each factor, as noted within Appendix
  C. Any risk-weighting adjustment(s) may vary year over year and will be dependent
  on the current payment integrity operating environment, managements discretion,
  and risk management functions.
