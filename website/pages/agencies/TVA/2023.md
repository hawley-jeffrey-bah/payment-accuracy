  duplicate payments, self-reporting, and vendor inquiries.  Additionally, a third-party
  auditor is utilized to recover monies owed to the agency.  The auditor either secures
  refunds or credits are applied to the vendors' accounts to collect monies owed to
  the agency.

detail_ara2_3: "For Payroll, management reviews and approves all time changes prior\
  \ to payments being made.  Additionally, the program's strong control environment\
  \ precludes significant overpayments. \n\nRegarding the Credit Card Program, the\
  \ agency leverages controls to help prevent overpayments.  Merchant Category Codes\
  \ manage where the credit card can be utilized.  The credit card also maintains\
  \ two different spend controls.  The first is on the transaction, and the second\
  \ is on the card's total available spend.  Finally, the agency's account has a maximum\
  \ spend threshold at the contract level, which is managed by the credit card merchant."
