detail_ara2_3: The USITC has one program (Research, Investigations, and Reports) that
  is fully funded by the annual appropriation.  In FY 2024, the appropriation for
  the agency was $122 million and improper payments were .0018% of the appropriation
  amount.  As a result, the agency determined that it is not cost effective to conduct
  recovery audits for the program but rather focus efforts on maintaining and improving
  strong internal controls that are designed to prevent and detect improper payments.
detail_ara2_3_2: The USITC only has one program that fulfills the mission of the agency.  The
  program that the Commission receives an annual appropriation for is Research, Investigations
  and Reporting. The agency has determined it is not cost effective to conduct recovery
  audits for this program.

detail_dpa5: USITC uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to review payment eligibility for
  purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments. The USITC utilizes a Shared
  Service Provider (IBC) to host our financial systems.  IBC posts a Do Not Pay file
  into Oracle on a weekly basis for USITC review. IBC utilizes the Treasury Working
  System to perform online searches and screen payments against the Do Not Pay databases.
  USITC is notified of any flagged payments or items in need of adjudication. During
  FY 2024, USITC vendor payments totaled approximately $16.4M.  The Do Not Pay Initiative
  has neither identified a material amount nor realized a reduction of improper payments
  attributable to implementing the Do Not Pay Initiative capabilities. Rather, Do
  Not Pay Initiative implementation has proven that USITC has robust and effective
  internal controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal funds.
detail_exs1: USITC Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with
  the Payment Integrity Information Act of of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance
  audit (OIG-MR-24-05) completed in May 2024. PIIA requires agencies to review and
  assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000
  for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible
  to significant improper payments. USITC only has one program and aims to conduct
  an improper payment risk assessment annually, but no less than once every three
  years. In FY 2024, USITC conducted improper payment risk assessments for the only
  program and determined it was not susceptible to significant improper payments.
  In addition, risk assessments will be performed if any significant changes affecting
  operations or funding occur to determine if the agency continues to be at low risk
  for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by
  PIIA. USITC maintains payment integrity with well-established processes, strong
  financial controls and continuous monitoring.

  \ Determination Report in May 2024, and determined that the Commission complied\
  \ with applicable PIIA requirements for Fiscal Year 2023.  The IG agreed that the\
  \ most recent risk assessment for FY 2021 did not identify any programs or activities\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the reporting threshold.\
  \  The IG also agreed with the OCFO’s conclusion that the Commission is at low risk\
  \ for significant improper payments and that the Commission’s programs are below\
  \ the established thresholds for additional reporting requirements.  No recommendations\
  \ were issued by the IG for FY 2023 activities. \n"
