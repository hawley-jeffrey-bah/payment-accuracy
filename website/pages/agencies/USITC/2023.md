detail_agy1: The results of the Commission's FY 2022 Assessment on its susceptibility
  to significant improper payments indicated the Commission was not susceptible to
  such payments. The the assessment is within the three year cycle, there have been
  no changes to the Commission's operations, and the IGs most recent finding is that
  the Commission is at low risk for significant improper payments and that the Commission’s
  programs are below the established thresholds.

detail_ara2_3: The Commission has one program - research, investigations, and reports
  - and its sole source of funding -- its annual appropriation -- is $122.4 million.
  Given that our improper payments have been less than one tenth of one percent of
  our appropriation I believe it is not cost effective to conduct recovery audits,
  and our efforts should be on preventing such payments to begin with.

  improper payments. The Commission's improper payments have been less than one-tenth
  of one percent the past several years.
detail_exs1: The Commission's FY 2022 assessment of its susceptible to significant
  improper payments indicated the Commission should be classified as Phase 1. While
  the Commission has not performed an assessment in FY 2023, to my knowledge there
  is no reason to not rely on the results of the previous assessment.

detail_pcp14: 'Our IG determined that the Commission complied with applicable PIIA
  requirements for Fiscal Year 2022; agreed that the most recent risk assessment for
  FY 2021 did not identify any programs or activities susceptible to significant improper
  payments at or above the reporting threshold; agreed with the OCFO’s conclusion
  that the Commission is at low risk for significant

  improper payments and that the Commission’s programs are below the established thresholds
  for additional reporting requirements; and, did not issue any recommendations.'
