detail_agy1: The results of the Commission's FY 2022 Assessment on its susceptibility
  to significant improper payments indicated the Commission was not susceptible to
  such payments. The the assessment is within the three year cycle, there have been
  no changes to the Commission's operations, and the IGs most recent finding is that
  the Commission is at low risk for significant improper payments and that the Commission’s
  programs are below the established thresholds.
detail_ara2_1: null
detail_ara2_2: null
detail_ara2_3: The Commission has one program - research, investigations, and reports
  - and its sole source of funding -- its annual appropriation -- is $122.4 million.
  Given that our improper payments have been less than one tenth of one percent of
  our appropriation I believe it is not cost effective to conduct recovery audits,
  and our efforts should be on preventing such payments to begin with.

detail_dpa5: To my knowledge our use of the Do Not Pay initiative has not reduced
  improper payments. The Commission's improper payments have been less than one-tenth
  of one percent the past several years.
detail_exs1: The Commission's FY 2022 assessment of its susceptible to significant
  improper payments indicated the Commission should be classified as Phase 1. While
  the Commission has not performed an assessment in FY 2023, to my knowledge there
  is no reason to not rely on the results of the previous assessment.
