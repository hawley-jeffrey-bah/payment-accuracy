detail_agy1: The USITC does not have a grants program and was not involved in the
  stimulus program. The vast majority of the USITC's expenditures are payroll (75
  percent) and payments to governmental trading partners (11 percent). The remaining
  expenditures are to commercial vendors, and we audit all of the high dollar value
  time and materials contracts, and report our findings (negative) to the IG.

detail_arp18: Most of the USITC's overpayments are payments to employees, such as
  unrecovered FICA tax that was not withheld and the employee subsequently left the
  agency. Some of these employees have paid the amounts, and we continue to contact
  those that have not. Even then these amounts are in the $5,000 range. We have occasionally
  (but not recently) overpaid a vendor or paid the wrong one, but these amounts were
  in the $10,000 range. When we cannot recover the payment we refer the vendor to
  the Treasury offset program.

  shared service provider, the Interior Business Center. There has not been any information
  relative to the USITC for some time.
detail_exs1: "The USITC has well established processes and internal controls to prevent\
  \ or detect improper payments. FY 2022 testing and review results over government\
  \ charge cards showed that the USITC can provide reasonable assurance that its internal\
  \ controls over the use of the cards were operating effectively and that no material\
  \ weaknesses were found in the design or operations of internal controls over the\
  \ charge card programs. \n\nThe USITC also tests for improper payments by reviewing\
  \ a sample of agency invoice disbursements to ensure the correct payment was issued\
  \ based on the contract award. Test results as well as the agency’s improper payment\
  \ strategy for testing and payment recovery are documented and submitted to OMB\
  \ in the Agency Financial Report (AFR) on an annual basis (e.g., FY 2021 Agency\
  \ Financial Report). \n\nFY 2022 testing for improper payments showed that the USITC\
  \ can provide reasonable assurance that its internal control over the payment issuance\
  \ or receipt of payments was operating effectively and that no material weaknesses\
  \ were found in the design or operations of the internal controls over disbursement\
  \ payments.  \n\nIn addition, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) reviews the\
  \ improper payment test strategy and testing to ensure compliance with the Payment\
  \ Integrity Improvement Act of 2019 (PIIA) (Public Law 116-117) and the Office of\
  \ Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C (M-21-19). \n\nFY 2022,\
  \ the OIG reviewed the agency’s PIIA compliance and issued their report April 26,\
  \ 2022. Their review showed that the agency complied with the requirements of PIIA\
  \ (OIG-MR-22-08). \n\nIn summary, FY 2022 financial control evaluations resulted\
  \ in no material weaknesses in financial processes that could result in inaccurate\
  \ financial reporting and testing showed that financial business processes were\
  \ in compliance with the FAR and PIIA requirements. \n"
