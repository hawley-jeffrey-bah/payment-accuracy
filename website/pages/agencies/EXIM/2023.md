detail_ara2_3: EXIM considered all its programs and activities and determined they
  are not susceptible to making significant improper payments at or above the threshold
  levels set by OMB. By performing recovery audits, the agency will incur costs for
  contractors or other entities to have highly skilled accounting specialists and
  fraud examiners, using state of the art tools and technology, to examine payment
  records and supporting documentation to uncover recoverable payments. Therefore,
  it was determined that is not cost-effective to conduct recovery audits to identify
  and recapture overpayments.

  EXIM annual performance elements include a goal on “Protect U.S. Taxpayers Through
  Good Governance” written into employee performance plans and appraisals. Good governance
  would include ensuring compliance with PIIA while establishing procedures and assessments
  which would prevent or mitigate any agency improper payments. In addition, the Code
  of Business Conduct and Ethics contains clauses related to commitment related to
  professionalism and behavior maintaining the highest standards of integrity, accountability,
  stewardship, commitment to excellence, customer focus, and innovation in their work.

detail_dpa5: EXIM complies with all aspects of the Do Not Pay Initiative through its
  Character, Reputational, and Transaction Integrity (CRTI) process. All transactions
  in the three authorization-based payment programs (Short, Medium, and Long-Term)
  undergo CRTI checks. As a part of CRTI, names of participants are searched within
  a database clearing house of over 20 directories to determine compliance with a
  variety of “Know your Customer” (KYC) and EXIM due-diligence requirements. Also,
  EXIM does not disburse funds directly to payees but through the U.S. Department
  of Treasury Secured Payment System, where any funds disbursed by the Department
  of Treasury go through payment integration in which the Do Not Pay portal automatically
  matches all the files against the Death Master file and the System for Award Management
  (SAM) exclusion records.
detail_exs1: The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requires agencies
  to review and assess all programs and activities they administer and identify those
  determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments. The Office of Management
  and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity
  Improvement, requires that agencies assess all programs with annual outlays greater
  than $10,000,000 for IP risk at least once every three years. The Export-Import
  Bank of the United States (EXIM) supports PIIA and OMB compliance through the activities
  of its Payment Integrity program, which comprises four separate programs, Short-term
  Authorizations, Medium-term Authorizations, Long- term Authorizations, and Cash-control
  Disbursements. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years. In
  FY 2023, EXIM conducted a risk assessment of all four programs and determined that
  none of its programs were susceptible for making significant improper payments.
detail_pcp12_1: '2'
detail_pcp14: "Among EXIM’s Payment Integrity efforts to prevent and reduce improper\
  \ and unknown payments, it conducts improper payments risk assessments covering\
  \ all four programs with annual outlays greater than $10M at least once every three\
  \ years as required by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C. In the most recent OIG report,\
  \ the OIG provided three recommendations for EXIM to improve the improper payments\
  \ process. In response to these recommendations, EXIM:\n•\tdeveloped and implemented\
  \ a process to ensure a consistent scoring system and rubric and applied consistently\
  \ throughout the scoring process;\n•\tdeveloped and implemented a process to maintain\
  \ the integrity of program owner responses and approvals by creating a SharePoint\
  \ site with restricted access for program owners to upload their final, signed risk\
  \ assessment questionnaires and;\n•\tassigned 2 designated OCFO officials to evaluate\
  \ and approve the results of the risk assessment.\nBased on the above activities,\
  \ the OIG confirmed that the three recommendations were cleared in September 2023.\n"
