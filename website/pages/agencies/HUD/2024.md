  During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH)\
  \ reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper\

  \ of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis\
  \ for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process\

  Salaries and Expenses\nFor the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD),\
  \ The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) reviews the unpaid report\
  \ to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the\
  \ Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to\
  \ an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to\
  \ rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department\
  \ of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports\
  \ to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified,\
  \ OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper\
  \ payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified\
  \ and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt\
  \ is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process,\
  \ the collection process is initiated. \nAlso, the Human Resources (HR) Division\
  \ performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS\
  \ report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions.\
  \ The report data is used to determine, personnel data or duty locations which will\
  \ cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing\
  \ (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate\
  \ a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period\
  \ timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be\
  \ submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee\
  \ will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment\
  \ plan. \nAs part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs\
  \ reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections\
  \ or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on\
  \ an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper\
  \ payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost\
  \ and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program\
  \ budget offices and Treasury’s ARC. \nThe Administrative Control of Funds Policies\
  \ Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices\
  \ follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future\
  \ improper payments.\n\nMultiFamily Notes\nThe MFNSB is responsible for overseeing\
  \ all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned\
  \ to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance\
  \ /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk\
  \ Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with\
  \ a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system\
  \ to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing,\
  \ and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing\
  \ all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned\
  \ to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance\
  \ /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk\
  \ Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with\
  \ a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system\
  \ to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing,\
  \ and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. Each note is serviced in accordance\
  \ with the mortgage and mortgage note documents. Servicing activities include billing,\
  \ collections, disbursements, escrow management, and processing of terminations.\
  \ Servicing activities are performed daily until termination of the note from the\
  \ system. \nTaxes and R4R escrows are incorporated into the note and managed by\
  \ the note. Amounts collected are all pre-determined by the language within the\
  \ note itself. Payment amounts (R4R costs, insurance, taxes and miscellaneous A/P)\
  \ are calculated based on invoices submitted. \nAll disbursements are initially\
  \ processed by the contractor. However, the Multifamily Notes Servicing Branch (MFNSB)\
  \ staff have final approval on all disbursements. No disbursements are made by the\
  \ contractor without approval from the MFNSB. Disbursements are approved by HUD.\
  \ \nEach payment request has an invoice and physical approval. Separation of duties\
  \ is maintained for the disbursement process. Contract staff create the transmittal\
  \ to allow the disbursement; a second contract staff approves the transmittal; a\
  \ third contract staff creates the disbursement. None of the staff have the authority\
  \ to perform any other duty in the payment process. Upon receipt of the disbursement\
  \ request from the contractor, it is reviewed by MFNSB staff to ensure the requested\
  \ disbursement is correct and in compliance with HUD guidelines. Employees conduct\
  \ data matching analytics to verify key information for disbursements such as project\
  \ name, address, FHA number, iREMS number, and dollar amount. For payment schedules\
  \ the Tax ID Number, Routing Number, Deposit Account Number, and Dollar Amount are\
  \ validated against supporting documentation to ensure accuracy. \nOnce the disbursements\
  \ are reviewed and approved by MFNSB, they are sent to the Cash Management Branch\
  \ (CMB) for certification and processing. Payments are disbursed directly to the\
  \ vendor responsible for collecting the disbursement and applying the funds to the\
  \ expense. Contract staff perform daily banking functions to ensure all checks have\
  \ been cashed and ACH transactions processed. \nOnce the Certifying Officer in CMB\
  \ certifies the schedule for payment, CMB sends the Secure Payment System (SPS)\
  \ Report via email to the MFNSB. Staff compares the schedule payment package to\
  \ the daily SPS Report and to the Goal Report Agency Location Codes (ALC) Payment\
  \ Details to ensure the payment information is correct. In addition, all cash activities\
  \ are reconciled through monthly accounting reconciliations. These payments are\
  \ also post payment checked \nOn a monthly basis, the MFNSB Chief conducts random\
  \ sampling of payment schedules. A sampling of 20% of paid schedules is selected\
  \ and reviewed for accuracy of information and payment. There have been no inaccuracies\
  \ or overpayments cited. In the event of an overpayment of taxes or hazard insurance,\
  \ the contractor will work with the tax authority or insurance provider to recoup\
  \ the overpayment. If the contractor is unable to recover the funds they will escalate\
  \ the issue to MFNSB, which will work with the account executive, the Office of\
  \ General Counsel, and the program area to ensure the overpayment is recaptured.\
  \ In the event of an overpayment of R4R, the contractor will work with the management\
  \ agent to recoup the overpayment. If the management agent fails to return the overpayment\
  \ within 30 days, MFNSB will notify the account executive and program area. The\
  \ overpayment will be included in the next scheduled billing statement and the management\
  \ agent will be issued a formal notification of the action.\n\nFederal Housing Administration\n\
  The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit\
  \ program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments.\
  \ Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper\
  \ payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing,\
  \ and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate\
  \ reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements\
  \ are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper.\
  \ As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are\
  \ reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.\nUnder Title I and Other Debt\
  \ Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily\
  \ responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including\
  \ responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises,\
  \ disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies\
  \ of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien\
  \ documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence\
  \ to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.\nThe FOC\
  \ is responsible for managing the business operations for the Title I loan program,\
  \ which includes registering and endorsing loans for insurance, billing and collecting\
  \ premiums, and examining claims for loss and approving them for payment. The FOC\
  \ is also responsible for performing the debt collection and servicing activities\
  \ for Title I Notes (defaulted Title I loans) and generic debts (other FHA debts).\n\
  The Title I program authorizes HUD to insure lenders against default on loans used\
  \ to finance property improvements and to purchase manufactured homes. Lenders are\
  \ required to pay premiums covering the insurance of their loans and submit applications\
  \ for insurance benefits for defaulted loans. HUD is required to collect the unpaid\
  \ loan balance, including eligible expenses, from the defaulted borrower.\nThe FOC’s\
  \ Title I Insurance Processing Branch (TIIPB) is responsible for evaluating and\
  \ approving lender applications for insurance benefits. The lender’s application\
  \ must include loan information and any documentation necessary for the TIIPB to\
  \ calculate a claim payment. There are three types of claim: initial, resubmitted,\
  \ and supplemental. An initial claim is a first submission. A resubmitted claim\
  \ is one that the TIIPB had previously denied. A supplemental claim is an additional\
  \ claim for the same loan when the lender finds documentation for expenses not included\
  \ in the initial claim. TIIPB support staff establish the claim in the Title I Insurance\
  \ and Claims System (TIIS/F72). The process includes assigning a claim number, entering\
  \ the date the claim was received, and assigning the claim to a TIIPB examiner.\
  \ The examiner conducts a full review of the claim to determine whether the loan\
  \ complies with Title I underwriting and servicing requirements and whether expenses\
  \ claimed by the lender are supported by the documentation provided. If these conditions\
  \ are satisfied, the examiner processes the claim calculation and authorization\
  \ for payment in TIIS/F72. TIIS/F72 processes the payments authorized on the same\
  \ day in a single batch file, sends the file to Treasury’s Payment Application Modernization\
  \ system, and sends another file to the Cash Management Branch to authorize the\
  \ Treasury disbursement. TIIS/F72 sends a file of paid claims to the Debt Collection\
  \ and Management System – Title I (DCAMS-TI/F71), which converts the paid claims\
  \ to notes receivable. The FOC’s Asset Recovery Division (ARD) is responsible for\
  \ pursuing collection against the debtor (defaulted borrower).\nThe TIIPB conducts\
  \ quality reviews of paid Title I claims to ensure consistent processing and examination\
  \ quality. Each month, the TIIPB Branch Chief randomly selects 10% of paid claims\
  \ for review. The Branch Chief either reviews the claim themselves or assigns them\
  \ to examiners for a peer review. The reviewer conducts a full examination of the\
  \ claim and reports whether the claim payment was conforming (compliant/no deficiencies),\
  \ deficient (minor issues to address), unacceptable (serious issues to address),\
  \ or mitigated (issues found but readily resolved). The outcomes of quality reviews\
  \ are documented in both the Case Notes screen of TIIS/F72 and in the Title I Quality\
  \ Reviews folder of the FOC’s SharePoint site.\nIf the review identified a deficiency\
  \ that resulted in an overpaid claim, the TIIPB Branch Chief or examiner will issue\
  \ a request to the lender for a full (for an unacceptable claim) or partial (for\
  \ a deficient claim) repurchase of the loan. The request instructs the lender to\
  \ repurchase the loan by remitting payment to a designated lockbox within 30 days\
  \ or to ask for a reconsideration of the repurchase request within 10 days. If the\
  \ lender fails to submit documentation that satisfactorily resolves the deficiency\
  \ or to remit payment within the established timeframes, TIIPB issues a repurchase\
  \ demand which gives the lender 30 days to remit the repurchase funds and informs\
  \ the lender of the actions HUD will take if the funds aren’t remitted, including\
  \ transferring the unpaid repurchase to the FOC’s ARD for delinquent debt collection,\
  \ which includes referral to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for administrative\
  \ offset.\nBoth paid and unpaid repurchase requests and demands involve coordination\
  \ between the FOC’s TIIPB and ARD. The ARD ensures that the Title I Note receivable\
  \ is reclassified as a full or partial repurchase. Payments for full and partial\
  \ repurchases are sent to the Title I Notes lockbox which transmits a collection\
  \ file to DCAMS-TI/F71 to credit the funds to the Title I Note receivable associated\
  \ with the claim. The ARD notifies the TIIPB when repurchase funds are received\
  \ and the TIIPB updates the claim record in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04). For full\
  \ repurchases, the ARD closes the Title I Note receivable as repurchased. Before\
  \ closing out the receivable, the ARD will issue the debtor (defaulted Title I borrower)\
  \ a refund for any non-repurchase collections received. The TIIPB returns the original\
  \ claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I\
  \ promissory note and lien, if applicable.\nUnpaid full or partial repurchase requests\
  \ and demands are transferred to the ARD for delinquent debt collection. The ARD\
  \ establishes a Title I Repurchase receivable in the Debt Collection and Asset Management\
  \ System – Generic Debt (DCAMS-GD/F71A), which initiates the collection process\
  \ by issuing an automated demand letter describing the debt and instructing the\
  \ lender to remit payment in full within 30 days or contact the designated ARD Debt\
  \ Servicing Representative (DSR) to request a plan to repay the debt in installments.\
  \ If the lender does not pay the debt in full or enter a repayment plan within 30\
  \ days, DCAMS-GD/F71A issues a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Collect by Administrative\
  \ Offset. The NOI notifies the lender that HUD intends to refer the debt to the\
  \ TOP, describes the TOP process for administrative offset of federal payments,\
  \ and provides the lender with steps to take to contest the basis of the debt or\
  \ the amount demanded by filing an appeal with HUD’s Board of Appeals (BOA) within\
  \ 65 days. If the lender files an appeal, DCAMS-GD/F71A suspends referral to TOP\
  \ pending a decision and order from the BOA administrative law judge. (BOA adjudicates\
  \ appeals by gathering and evaluating statements and documents from both parties.)\
  \ If the BOA judge issues a decision and order declaring the debt unenforceable,\
  \ the ARD closes the debt as unenforceable and notifies the TIIPB. The TIIPB will\
  \ reverse the pending repurchase in TIIS/F72. If the decision and order results\
  \ in a dismissal of the lender’s appeal, the DSR updates debt status in DCAMS-GD/F71A\
  \ making the debt eligible for referral to TOP. DCAMS-GD/F71A refers eligible debts\
  \ that are 121 or more days delinquent to TOP and the Treasury Cross-Servicing Program.\
  \ DCAMS-GD/F71A also reports lenders to commercial credit reporting agencies (Dun\
  \ & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax).\nThe TIIPB may, rather than transfer the\
  \ unpaid repurchase to the ARD for delinquent debt collection, pursue internal offset\
  \ of payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. In most cases, however,\
  \ it’s more effective to transfer the debt to the ARD, since any federal payment\
  \ made to the lender, including Title I claim payments, will be collected through\
  \ TOP.\nCollections, both voluntary and involuntary, received on a Title Repurchase\
  \ debt are credited to the account. When a debt is paid in full, the ARD makes entries\
  \ in DCAMS-GD/F71A to close out the debt as paid in full and to close out the Title\
  \ I Note receivable as unenforceable. The TIIPB makes entries in TIIS/F72 (subfunction\
  \ J04) to acknowledge satisfaction of the repurchase demand and returns the original\
  \ claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I\
  \ Promissory Note and lien, if applicable.\n If the ARD concludes that the Title\
  \ I Repurchase debt is uncollectible, it takes steps to close out the debt in DCAMS-GD/F71A,\
  \ which will issue an IRS Form 1099-C to the lender and report the debt accordingly\
  \ to the IRS. The TIIPB will pursue secondary recovery activities on the uncollectible\
  \ repurchase by internally offsetting future claims payments to the lender or blocking\
  \ payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. The TIIPB may also refer\
  \ the lender to FHA’s Mortgagee Review Board for sanctions\nThe Debt Collection\
  \ Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic\
  \ debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters,\
  \ report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice\
  \ Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer\
  \ eligible debts to the TOP and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and\
  \ the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180\
  \ days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper\
  \ referral for TOP offset.\nFor internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative\
  \ claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB)\
  \ sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the\
  \ receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established\
  \ in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further\
  \ identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and\
  \ endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record\
  \ to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the\
  \ debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted\
  \ by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously\
  \ identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.\nIf a payment\
  \ is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against\
  \ subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied.\
  \ If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC\
  \ in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially\
  \ confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables\
  \ have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to\
  \ the FOC for recovery.\nAnother avenue by which improper payments are recaptured\
  \ is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical\
  \ sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim\
  \ filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual\
  \ mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents\
  \ before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary\
  \ findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited\
  \ to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance\
  \ of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable\
  \ and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim,\
  \ the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender, which\
  \ is usually resolved within 30 days of final settlement. The mortgagee either returns\
  \ the overpaid funds or files a supplemental claim. If the overpayment is not resolved\
  \ within the 30-day or 60-day period after final settlement, the reviewer sends\
  \ a follow-up letter at the end of each period advising the mortgagee of the penalties\
  \ and interest assessed. If still not resolved after 90 days, the overpayment is\
  \ electronically transferred to HUD’s FOC in Albany, New York for collection. Lastly,\
  \ for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the\
  \ Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection\
  \ Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent\
  \ debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.\n\
  The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to\
  \ the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an\
  \ offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its\
  \ private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect\
  \ the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS\
  \ to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions,\
  \ to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.\nThe FOC’s recapture\
  \ process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s).\
  \ If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding\
  \ enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process\
  \ rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS.\
  \ Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.\n\
  If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset\
  \ via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury\
  \ contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the\
  \ Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative\
  \ Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.\nIf\
  \ Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt\
  \ to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case\
  \ is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset\
  \ via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g.,\
  \ AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the\
  \ case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following\
  \ January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance\
  \ can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate\
  \ (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).\nCollections from debtors to HUD go\
  \ to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury\
  \ or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment\
  \ and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable\
  \ in DCAMS.\n"

detail_ara2_3: "I. Nature of the Program\nRHAP - Tenant Based Rental Assistance Section\
  \ 8 Housing Certificate Fund & Tenant Based Rental Assistance\n\nA payment recapture\
  \ audit was deemed not be cost-beneficial based on the nature of these programs.\
  \ Collectability is a concern as tenants may no longer be receiving housing assistance\
  \ when the overpayments are identified, or many may not be able to repay the subsidy\
  \ with their own resources. HSNG Owners/ PIH PHAs use the Enterprise Income Verification\
  \ (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information and reduce administrative\
  \ and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative guidance. The\
  \ program Points of Contact (POC) use EIV to monitor the owner’s compliance with\
  \ access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored locally at each\
  \ Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered by PHAs nationwide.\
  \ A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in addition to staff time.\
  \ There are also no centralized computer database capturing documents used to support\
  \ the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts\
  \ to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.\n\
  \nII. Lack of Empirical Evidence\nChoice Neighborhoods Initiative\nFamily Self-Sufficiency\
  \ Program\nPublic Housing Capital Fund\nPublic Housing Operating Fund\nRevitalization\
  \ of Severely Distressed Public Housing (HOPE VI)\nResearch and Technology\n\nThe\
  \ results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessments identified these programs\
  \ as not susceptible to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence,\
  \ either through risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring\
  \ reviews, that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs\
  \ and activities, and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment\
  \ recapture audits of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts\
  \ to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.\n\
  \nIII. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Programs\nCapacity Building\n\
  Community Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Hurricane Harvey, Irma,\
  \ Maria)\nCommunity Development Fund - Disaster Recovery Assistance (Louisiana,\
  \ Texas, West Virginia, Hurricane IKE, Other Disasters)\nNeighborhood Stabilization\
  \ Program\nProject Based Section 8 - Renewal of Expiring Sec. 8 Mod Rehab SRO\n\
  Self-Help Homeowner Opportunity Program (SHOP)\nCommunity Project Funding - Community\
  \ Project/Congressional Funding\n\nThe CPD funds have a monitoring process in place\
  \ to assess the quality of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve\
  \ the findings of audits and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about\
  \ program participants that is critical for making informed judgments about program\
  \ effectiveness and management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances\
  \ of fraud, waste, and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts,\
  \ written communications, analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings.\
  \ Monitoring also provides opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments\
  \ as well as successful management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might\
  \ be replicated by other CPD program participants. \nParties involved include Special\
  \ Need Assistance Programs (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and\
  \ Coordination (OPDC), Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED),\
  \ Office of General Counsel (OGC), Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1a,\
  \ Guide for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal\
  \ entity’s compliance with requirements of Subparts D and F of 2 Code of Federal\
  \ Regulations (CFR) part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles,\
  \ and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement\
  \ and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures are reviewed\
  \ to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines whether\
  \ the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will recapture\
  \ overpayments by offsetting future draws. Overpayments in the Neighborhood Stabilization\
  \ Program are addressed through reduction of future allocations as opposed to future\
  \ draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD will typically instruct\
  \ the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal funds sources to their grant’s\
  \ line of credit in Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) or to the Treasury’s account\
  \ if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less than\
  \ $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO Box\
  \ 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer\
  \ to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System (TFCS). CPD\
  \ programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment has been\
  \ recovered. \nIn addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment\
  \ identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper payments.\
  \ Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would\
  \ exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.\n\nIV. Similar Overpayment\
  \ Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs\n2500-Contractor Payments\n3300-Master\
  \ Sub-Servicer (MSS) Default Activity\n\nFor any overpayments identified, Ginnie\
  \ Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments to the contractor.\
  \ However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie Mae will request\
  \ reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments made to the General\
  \ Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor, Ginnie Mae will\
  \ process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments is greater than\
  \ the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions than mitigating\
  \ strategies as outlined already. \nAs it relates to the Pass-Through Assistance\
  \ Program (PTAP) program, which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper\
  \ payments includes validation of the request against the loan and pool information\
  \ submitted to the Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers\
  \ equity and liquidity as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the\
  \ custodial account balance from which the Investor payments will be drawn.\nThe\
  \ PTAP disbursement process is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests.\
  \ The PTAP disbursement request is processed for review and approval for payment.\
  \ All payment requests are approved by an Independent Certifying Officer (ICO) (who\
  \ accepts personal financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper\
  \ payments they certify). The cost of recovering improper payments would exceed\
  \ the benefit of improper payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the\
  \ program.\n\nV. Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance\
  \ Programs\nProject-Based Rental Assistance Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation\n\
  Rental Housing Assistance Program – Section 236\n\nThe results of HUD’s payment\
  \ integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs are mandated\
  \ by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s EIV system. EIV is a web-based application\
  \ which provides owners with employment, wage, unemployment compensation and social\
  \ security benefit information for tenants participating in HUD’s assisted housing\
  \ programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is a system developed\
  \ to improve the fiscal control over assisted housing programs and acts as the sole\
  \ repository of all tenant certification data, assistance contract data and crucial\
  \ payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS and a variance of $2,400 per year generates\
  \ an error and owners are required to follow-up with the tenant and resolve the\
  \ error. If an overpayment is identified, tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum\
  \ or by entering into a repayment agreement. Therefore, the cost of any additional\
  \ attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments\
  \ recovered.\n\nOf the thirty-eight (38) programs excluded from a Payment Recapture\
  \ Audit, the remaining twenty (20) programs have other mechanisms in place to recover\
  \ overpayments.\n\nFair Housing Assistance Program\nFair Housing Initiative Program\n\

  the agency has been unable to fully utilize DNP. This lapse has resulted in payments
  to entities with inactive or unregistered System for Award Management (SAM) statuses,

detail_exs1: "In FY 2024, HUD conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of its disbursement\
  \ processes and programs using FY 2023 payment data. This rigorous assessment revealed\
  \ no additional programs susceptible to significant improper payments, a significant\
  \ achievement considering that prior-year analyses had identified two such programs.\
  \ \n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) embarked on a critical\
  \ mission: to ensure the integrity of its payment systems and safeguard taxpayer\
  \ dollars while effectively delivering essential housing assistance. This journey,\
  \ mandated by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), proved far more\
  \ complex than initially anticipated, especially concerning Multifamily rental assistance\
  \ programs, as well as the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program. Specifically,\
  \ the Multifamily portfolio   is comprised of (Section 8, Section 202, and Section\
  \ 811), and will be referred to as project-based rental assistance (PBRA). The sheer\
  \ scale and intricacy of this program presented a formidable challenge to payment\
  \ integrity testing.  For the PBRA program, HUD is entrusted with the stewardship\
  \ of over $15 billion in funds, that vast majority of which is paid  through contract\
  \ administrators to property owners on behalf of the tenants the program serves.\
  \ This multi-layered process, involving hardcopy documentation maintained by various\
  \ entities introduces significant challenges for payment integrity testing.\n\n\
  In prior years, validating payments and identifying populations for testing within\
  \ PBRA was a manual, resource-intensive process, hampered by decentralized document\
  \ retention and varying procedures at the contract administrators. The existing\
  \ basic sub-sampling approach yielded limited insights and risked overlooking errors\
  \ further down the payment chain. HUD recognized the need for a transformation and\
  \ responded with a series of innovations.\n\nNew templates and automation processes\
  \ were introduced to streamline payment reconciliation and enhance data accuracy.\
  \ The shift from basic sub-sampling to a sophisticated, statistically valid, discrete\
  \ population testing methodology for FY2024 represented a significant leap forward.\
  \ This approach independently tested both payment accuracy (Payee Tier) and tenant\
  \ eligibility (Eligibility Tier),  providing unprecedented visibility into errors,\
  \ their root causes at all levels, and precision rates. The payee tier measures\
  \ the rate of accuracy of HUD payments to contract administrators, and the tenant\
  \ eligibility tier measures the accuracy of contract administrator payments to property\
  \ owners. This year HUD is only able to report on the payee tier payment accuracy.\
  \ HUD does not yet have sufficient data to report on the eligibility tier payment\
  \ accuracy. HUD aimed to reduce the burden on contract administrators while maintaining\
  \ statistical validity. To protect sensitive information (PII), a secure SharePoint\
  \ site was established, ensuring data privacy in the collection process from recipients.\
  \ Robotic Process Automation (RPA) streamlined the tedious process of document collection\
  \ and recipient coordination.\n\nThe variability in the contract administrators’\
  \ processes, controls, and documentation retention amplify the risk of improper\
  \ payments, especially in the Payee Tier (payments from contract administrators\
  \ to property owners),    a high-risk area highlighted by both HUD and the Office\
  \ of Inspector General (OIG). This prompted HUD to focus significant resources on\
  \ the Payee Tier testing, understanding that heightened risk exists outside HUD’s\
  \ direct control.\n\nHUD's enhanced FY2024 testing strategy did result in a reliable\
  \ measurement of the Payee Tier: The Payee Tier showed a reliable (96% precision\
  \ rate) unknown payment rate of a mere 0.30% ($45.2 million), significantly below\
  \ statutory thresholds. This success demonstrates HUD's commitment to protecting\
  \ taxpayer money. Eligibility Tier testing, however, revealed significant difficulties\
  \ in retrieving evidence from the contract administrators to support the timely\
  \ verification of tenant eligibility and any error rate estimation would be misleading\
  \ based on a lack of precision in extrapolating an error rate.  The lack of precision\
  \ prevented production of a reliable error rate for the Eligibility Tier.  As corrective\
  \ actions, HUD is working to improve contract administrators’ timely evidence collection,\
  \ retention, and submission through training and outreach. By implementing new technologies,\
  \ refining methodologies, and engaging actively with stakeholders, HUD is not only\
  \ safeguarding taxpayer dollars but also ensuring that vital housing assistance\
  \ reaches those who need it most. While challenges remain, the progress made reflects\
  \ HUD's dedication to transparency, efficiency, and accountability in managing its\
  \ programs. HUD   will also continue working to improve the payment integrity and\
  \ exploring a methodology that will ensure that tenant eligibility is accurate and\
  \ reliable.   During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned\
  \ improvements to determine effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance\
  \ program for preventing and detecting improper payments as documented by the Public\
  \ and Indian Housing IT modernization plan.  Currently, HUD’s Office of Public and\
  \ Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance Monitoring\
  \ Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify\
  \ and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income eligibility,\
  \ eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public housing agency’s\
  \ (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed both on site and\
  \ in the virtual environment.  HUD explored using existing reports to estimate improper\
  \ payment rates.  Existing reports did not meet stringent payment integrity requirements\
  \ and could not produce reliable errors with an adequate precision rate that addressed\
  \ the full payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to public housing\
  \ authorities (PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility\
  \ verification.  HUD will continue the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization\
  \ plan and determine approaches to test sub-populations. By exploring other approaches\
  \ for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will be able to\
  \ support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and tailor the\
  \ testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit efforts to test the full\
  \ payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through improvements to\
  \ HUD’s Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) and the Enhanced EIV tool.\n\
