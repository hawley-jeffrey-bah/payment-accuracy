detail_ara2_1: "(Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) –Disaster Relief Appropriation\
  \ Act (DRAA) Sandy – CPD)\n\nThe CPD Community Development Block Grant – DRAA-Sandy\
  \ program monitors disaster recovery activities for Federally declared disaster\
  \ arepas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The grantee submits a quarterly performance\
  \ report using the Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting (DRGR) system that is reviewed\
  \ by CPD field offices or HUD headquarters. The performance reports are used to\
  \ review the grant expenditures and accomplishments for all CDBG-DR funded activities.\
  \ The grantee also uses the DRGR system to submit vouchers and drawdown funds. After\
  \ a voucher is created and submitted by a grantee Drawdown Requester, the voucher\
  \ line items must be reviewed and approved by the grantee Drawdown Approver. If\
  \ a line item is approved, it is either sent to the Line of Credit Control System\
  \ (LOCCS) for processing, or, if the grant drawdown threshold of $5 million has\
  \ been reached, it is sent to HUD for review and approval before it can be submitted\
  \ to LOCCS. CPD also monitors the grantee’s efforts to prevent the duplication of\
  \ benefits and ensure programmatic compliance. \nCPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide\
  \ for Review of Financial Management and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal\
  \ entity’s compliance with requirements Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform\
  \ Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal\
  \ Awards, except for cost allowability, procurement, and equipment. The exhibits\
  \ located in Chapter 6 of the CPD Monitoring Handbook, serve the purpose of capturing\
  \ improper payments identified in the program file-level reviews during on-site\
  \ or remote monitoring. If any improper payments are identified the reviewer must\
  \ indicate on the monitoring exhibit the program area, amount, type of improper\
  \ payment and the corrective action. The grantee is notified of any improper payments\
  \ identified during the monitoring review at the exit conference. If the grantee\
  \ is unable to provide documentation to resolve the improper payment, a finding\
  \ will be issued in the Monitoring Report which is transmitted to the grantee within\
  \ 90 days of the monitoring review. In most cases, CPD recaptures overpayments by\
  \ offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds on the grant, HUD typically\
  \ instructs the grantee to either repay funds from non-federal sources to their\
  \ grant’s line of credit in LOCCS, or to Treasury’s account if the grant has closed\
  \ or the funding availability period has expired. Additionally, CPD may also withhold\
  \ additional funding until the overpayment has been recovered. \nAdditionally, HUD\
  \ monitors all high-risk grantees annually and, in some instances, bi-annually.\
  \ Although these monitoring engagements do not exclusively include a review of improper\
  \ payments, the reviewers are able to identify improper payments during the file\
  \ review. If a grantee must repay HUD, CPD will coordinate with the applicable offices\
  \ depending on the amount being repaid. A remittance to the line of credit of less\
  \ than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth, whereas\
  \ any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire transfer to the Department\
  \ of U.S. Treasury Financial Communications System (TFCS).\n\n(Salaries and Expenses\
  \ - ADMN, CFO, CIO, CPD, Chief Procurement Officer (CPO), FHEO, Ginnie Mae, HSNG,\
  \ OCFO, OCHCO, OCIO, PDR, PIH)\n\nThe Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer\
  \ (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy payments. \n\
  For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO reviews the unpaid\
  \ report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard\
  \ for the POI 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel\
  \ and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake.\
  \ For example, OCHCO collaborates with the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service\
  \ (BFS) and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run\
  \ all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the\
  \ source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible\
  \ to correct the improper payment. Through the Payroll, Benefits, and Retirement\
  \ Division’s (PBRD) quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated.\
  \ Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated,\
  \ and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection\
  \ process is initiated.\nAlso, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality\
  \ review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC\
  \ Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data\
  \ is used to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data\
  \ or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the\
  \ History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error,\
  \ which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods.\
  \ Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed\
  \ and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System\
  \ (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity\
  \ to setup a payment plan.\nThe Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) provides\
  \ assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper payroll payments\
  \ and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request. For other than payroll\
  \ payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments, contract payments, and\
  \ Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices follow the Administrative\
  \ Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6)\
  \ to ensure improper payments are prevented or detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget\
  \ provides assistance to budget offices upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial\
  \ System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI) suite of reports to include the Procurement\
  \ Request Information System Management (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment\
  \ systems (e.g. Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used\
  \ to identify, and sometimes, recover improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses\
  \ (S&E) payments. Most program offices have designated individuals to run and review\
  \ payment reports for discrepancies and improper payments including unauthorized\
  \ purchases in line with departmental and program office funds control policies.\
  \ Additionally, program office Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure\
  \ invoice payments are proper and made in line with contract guidelines through\
  \ the use of reports ran through IPP and related OBI reports.\nAs part of the bi-weekly\
  \ payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of\
  \ payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities\
  \ for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides\
  \ assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from\
  \ OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data\
  \ regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s Administrative\
  \ Resource Center (ARC).\nOCFO-Budget provides assistance to program budget offices\
  \ by flagging payroll corrections or unusual payroll activity as part of a bi-weekly\
  \ payroll projection process. OCFO-Budget also works with program offices and ARC\
  \ to correct these issues.\nAdditionally, program Budget office’s work with ARC,\
  \ HUD OCFO, and HUD’s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) HUD CPO in\
  \ the payment recapture process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments.\
  \ For example, program budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff\
  \ on the recapture of improper payments.\nThe Administrative Control of Funds Policies\
  \ Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices\
  \ follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future\
  \ improper payments.\n\n(Lead Hazard Reduction – OLHCHH)\n\nDuring grant execution,\
  \ the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices,\
  \ vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the\
  \ Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides\
  \ fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment,\
  \ the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper\
  \ payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The\
  \ appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR\
  \ (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal\
  \ denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter\
  \ would be referred to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for action. \nDuring\
  \ the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred,\
  \ the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required\
  \ by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The\
  \ COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the\
  \ recapturing of funds. \nIn addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and\
  \ the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The\
  \ Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance).\
  \ OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding.\
  \ The risks of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is\
  \ a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already\
  \ been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit\
  \ information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal\
  \ Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation.\
  \ The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant\
  \ Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same.\
  \ Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed.\
  \ On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed\
  \ and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are\
  \ required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the Office\
  \ of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers\
  \ and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government\
  \ Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients\
  \ with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory,\
  \ grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment,\
  \ a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal,\
  \ if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts),\
  \ as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the\
  \ funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred\
  \ to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for action. \nDuring the close-out of a\
  \ grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked\
  \ to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee\
  \ submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check\
  \ and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds.\
  \ \nIn addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation\
  \ with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents\
  \ the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process\
  \ assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The risks of\
  \ improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement\
  \ program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed\
  \ and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on\
  \ work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report\
  \ (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part\
  \ 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053)\
  \ must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring,\
  \ a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted\
  \ once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined\
  \ for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly\
  \ reports.\n\n(Contracts/Grants (includes Single Family Upfront Grant)\nFederal\

  \ Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall\
  \ program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies\
  \ and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes,\
  \ and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper\
  \ payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify\
  \ potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery\
  \ actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit\
  \ plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews\
  \ are performed.\nUnder Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2,\
  \ the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt\
  \ collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries\
  \ regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt\
  \ referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds\
  \ of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents,\
  \ repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise\
  \ agreements and supporting documents.\nThe Debt Collection Asset Management System\
  \ (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process.\
  \ DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent\
  \ debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System\
  \ (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts\
  \ to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined\
  \ criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later\
  \ than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent\
  \ improper referral for TOP offset.\nFor internal offsets, over-claimed amounts\
  \ (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims\
  \ Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed\
  \ and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables\
  \ are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case\
  \ number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate\
  \ fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder\
  \ of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in\
  \ ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated\
  \ by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted\
  \ to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.\n\
  If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset\
  \ against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable\
  \ is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred\
  \ to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC\
  \ officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and\
  \ that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has\
  \ been referred to the FOC for recovery.\nAnother avenue by which improper payments\
  \ are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance\
  \ Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with\
  \ FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared\
  \ and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by\
  \ providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee\
  \ chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report,\
  \ those funds are deposited to ARS, \nwhich applies them to the Mortgage Insurance\
  \ (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which\
  \ establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is\
  \ overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the\
  \ overage back from the lender. If the lender fails to respond to their demands,\
  \ the debt is referred to the FOC for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing,\
  \ the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement\
  \ Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The\
  \ Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for\
  \ Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.\nThe Treasury’s\
  \ TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the Treasury’s\
  \ Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). BFS performs computer matching with disbursement\
  \ data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral,\
  \ Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the\
  \ debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a\
  \ process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency,\
  \ among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.\n\
  The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand\
  \ notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of\
  \ Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor\
  \ regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to\
  \ credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically\
  \ assessed if warranted.\nIf the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury\
  \ (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection\
  \ action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury\
  \ also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation\
  \ and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such\
  \ action to be appropriate.\nIf Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful,\
  \ Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable\
  \ is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC\
  \ keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection\
  \ measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates\
  \ collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation\
  \ of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out,\
  \ and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if\
  \ determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).\nCollections\
  \ from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections\
  \ from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental\
  \ Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to\
  \ the receivable in DCAMS."

detail_ara2_3: "Programs grouped based on justifications for exclusion\n\nGroup 1\
  \ - Nature of Program\nA payment recapture audit would not be cost-beneficial based\
  \ on the nature of these programs. Collectability is a concern as tenants may no\
  \ longer be receiving housing assistance when the overpayments are identified, or\
  \ many may not be able to repay the subsidy with their own resources. HSNG Owners/\
  \ Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) use the Enterprise\
  \ Income Verification (EIV) system to verify tenant employment/income information\
  \ and reduce administrative and subsidy payment errors in accordance with HUD administrative\
  \ guidance. The program Points of Contact (POCs) use EIV to monitor the owner’s\
  \ compliance with access and use of the system. However, tenant files are stored\
  \ locally at each Multifamily property and some RHAP activities are administered\
  \ by PHAs nationwide. A recovery audit would involve substantial travel costs in\
  \ addition to staff time. There are also no centralized computer database capturing\
  \ documents used to support the rental subsidy determinations. Therefore, the cost\
  \ of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would exceed the benefit\
  \ of improper payments recovered.\n\nGroup 2 - Lack of Empirical Evidence\nThe results\
  \ of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments. There is no empirical evidence, either through\
  \ risk assessments, A-123 internal control reviews, and other monitoring reviews,\
  \ that suggests significant improper payments exist within these programs and activities,\
  \ and it is not likely that HUD would realize any benefit to payment recapture audits\
  \ of these programs. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper\
  \ payments would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.\n\nGroup 3 -\
  \ Similar Overpayment Recovery Activities for CPD Program\nThese Community Planning\
  \ and Development (CPD) funds have a monitoring process in place to assess the quality\
  \ of performance of the grantee over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits\
  \ and other reviews. Monitoring provides information about program participants\
  \ that is critical for making informed judgments about program effectiveness and\
  \ management efficiency. It also helps in identifying instances of fraud, waste,\
  \ and abuse. The process involves frequent telephone/email contacts, written communications,\
  \ analysis of reports and audits, and periodic meetings. Monitoring also provides\
  \ opportunities to identify program participant accomplishments as well as successful\
  \ management/ implementation/evaluation techniques that might be replicated by other\
  \ CPD program participants.\nParties involved include Special Need Assistance Programs\
  \ (SNAP), Field Offices, Office of Policy Development and Coordination (OPDC), Office\
  \ of Rural Housing and Economic Development (ORHED), Office of General Counsel (OGC),\
  \ Budget and OCFO. CPD’s program exhibit 34-1, Guide for Review of Financial Management\
  \ and Audits, is designed to monitor non-federal entity’s compliance with requirements\
  \ of Subparts D and F of 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost\
  \ Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, except for cost allowability,\
  \ procurement and equipment. During the monitoring process, program expenditures\
  \ are reviewed to determine if improper payments were made. If identified CPD determines\
  \ whether the appropriate corrective actions took place. In most cases, CPD will\
  \ recapture overpayments by offsetting future draws. If there are no remaining funds\
  \ on the grant, HUD will typically instruct the grantee to either repay funds from\
  \ non-federal funds sources to their grant’s line of credit in LOCCS or to the Treasury’s\
  \ account if the grant has been closed. A remittance to the line of credit of less\
  \ than $2,000 may be made by sending a check to HUD-FAD Collections Ft. Worth PO\
  \ Box 6200-05, whereas any remittance of more than $2,000 must be sent via wire\
  \ transfer to the Department of U.S. Treasury’s Financial Communications System\
  \ (TFCS). CPD programs could also withhold additional funding until the overpayment\
  \ has been recovered.\nIn addition, the results of HUD’s payment integrity risk\
  \ assessment identified these programs as not susceptible to significant improper\
  \ payments. Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments\
  \ would exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered. \n\nGroup 4 - Similar\
  \ Overpayment Recovery Activities for Ginnie Mae Programs\nFor any overpayments\
  \ identified, Ginnie Mae will either request reimbursement or offset future payments\
  \ to the contractor. However, if there are no future invoices to be provided, Ginnie\
  \ Mae will request reimbursement for the improper payment. To recover overpayments\
  \ made to the General Services Administration (GSA) for invoice payments to a vendor,\
  \ Ginnie Mae will process an IPAC. When the cost of recovering improper payments\
  \ is greater than the benefits, then Ginnie Mae will not pursue any further actions\
  \ than mitigating strategies as outlined already. \nAs it relates to the PTAP program\
  \ which is new for 2021, the process for identifying improper payments includes\
  \ validation of the request against the loan and pool information submitted to the\
  \ Reporting and Feedback System (RFS), evaluation of the issuers equity and liquidity\
  \ as reported with the PTAP request, and evaluation of the custodial account balance\
  \ from which the Investor payments will be drawn.\nThe PTAP disbursement process\
  \ is the same as in all Ginnie Mae disbursement requests. The PTAP disbursement\
  \ request is processed for review and approval for payment. All payment requests\
  \ are approved by an ICO – Independent Certifying Officer (who accepts personal\
  \ financial responsibility and criminal liability for improper payments they certify).\
  \ \nThe cost of recovering improper payments would exceed the benefit of improper\
  \ payments recovered and would not be beneficial to the program.\n\nGroup 5 - Similar\
  \ Overpayment Recovery Activities for Other Rental Assistance Programs\nThe results\
  \ of HUD’s payment integrity risk assessment identified these programs as not susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments. All owners receiving funding from these programs\
  \ are mandated by 24 CFR 5.233 to fully utilize HUD’s Enterprise Income Verification\
  \ (EIV) system. EIV is a web-based application which provides owners with employment,\
  \ wage, unemployment compensation and social security benefit information for tenants\
  \ participating in HUD’s assisted housing programs. Tenant Rental Assistance Certification\
  \ System (TRACS) is a system developed to improve the fiscal control over assisted\
  \ housing programs and acts as the sole repository of all tenant certification data,\
  \ assistance contract data and crucial payment data. EIV is matched against TRACS\
  \ and a variance of $2,400 per year generates an error and owners are required to\
  \ follow-up with the tenant and resolve the error. If an overpayment is identified,\
  \ tenants may pay the owner in a lump sum or by entering into a repayment agreement.\
  \ Therefore, the cost of any additional attempts to recover improper payments would\
  \ exceed the benefit of improper payments recovered.\n\nPrograms with other mechanisms\
  \ for payment recapture\n\nOf the thirty-nine (39) programs excluded from a Payment\
  \ Recapture Audit, the remaining sixteen (16) programs have other mechanisms in\
  \ place to recover overpayments.\n"
