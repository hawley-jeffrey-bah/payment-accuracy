detail_ara2_3: 'The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit
  program for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination,
  the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted
  over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and
  overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments
  to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.


  The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor
  payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The
  Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments
  since it began its analysis. In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing
  may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if
  determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than
  $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on
  the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as
  the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions.
  However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit
  program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to
  the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program.

  As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review
  Staff and multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that the whistleblower award
  program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture
  audits would be beneficial.


  The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across
  all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment
  recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.'

detail_dpa5: "The Do Not Pay (DNP) solution is a governmentwide initiative to screen\
  \ payment recipients before a contract award or payment is made to eliminate payment\
  \ errors before they occur. The Commission has integrated the solution into existing\
  \ processes as part of its efforts to identify and prevent improper payments. The\
  \ Commission’s shared services provider utilizes the DNP Business Center, on the\
  \ Commission’s behalf, to perform online searches and screen payments against the\
  \ DNP databases to augment data analytics capabilities. \n\nAll non-payroll payments\
  \ disbursed by the Commission are processed through the DNP portal, including payments\
  \ to whistleblowers and travel reimbursements to Commission employees.  As of October\
  \ 21, 2024, 3,277 FY 2024 payments totaling $149.9 million were processed through\
  \ the DNP portal, representing 100.0 percent of all non-payroll payments disbursed\
  \ by the Commission.  Based on the results of the reviews to date, the DNP initiative\
  \ has not identified any improper payments for the Commission."
detail_exs1: "On March 2, 2020, the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)\
  \ repealed the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), the Improper Payments\
  \ Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), the Improper Payments Elimination\
  \ and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA), and the Fraud Reduction and Data\
  \ Analytics Act of 2015 (FRDA).  PIIA is comprehensive payment integrity legislation\
  \ that incorporates all prior payment integrity legislation into one Act. PIIA is\
  \ implemented by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity\
  \ Improvement. Appendix C requires Federal agencies to perform a risk assessment\
  \ and review of each low-risk program and activity at least once every three years\
  \ to identify programs that may be susceptible to significant improper payments,\
  \ perform statistically valid testing of programs considered high risk, and develop\
  \ and implement corrective action plans for high-risk programs. \n\nThe Commission\
  \ has identified two programs—Operations and Administration and Whistleblower Payments—that\
  \ have annual outlays exceeding $10 million.  The Commission performs a risk assessment\
  \ for both of its major programs every three years as required by OMB Circular A-123,\
  \ Appendix C.  The last risk assessment was completed for both programs in October\
  \ 2022 covering FY 2022 outlays for the period October 1, 2021, to September 30,\
  \ 2022.\n\nAs part of each risk assessment, the Commission reviews the risk factors\
  \ for improper payments and completes a Risk Score Card for each program. The risk\
  \ factors considered by the Commission include how long the program has been in\
  \ operation; the complexity and volume of disbursements transactions; source of\
  \ payment eligibility decisions; recent major changes in program funding, authorities,\
  \ practices, or procedures; level, experience, and quality of training for personnel\
  \ responsible for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments\
  \ are accurate; and whether there have been any significant deficiencies disclosed\
  \ in the audit reports of the Commission. \n\nEach of these risk factors are evaluated\
  \ against the Commission’s internal controls and assessed by testing key internal\
  \ controls as part of the Commission’s robust Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity\
  \ Act of 1982 (FMFIA) internal controls process. A score of High, Moderate, or Low\
  \ risk is assigned to the overall risk for each program as well as the likelihood\
  \ and impact of an improper payment. In the last risk assessment, both the Operations\
  \ and Administration and Whistleblower Payments programs were identified as having\
  \ a moderate risk of making an improper payment. For the Operations and Administration\
  \ program, this assessment was due to the complexity of the program, the volume\
  \ of payments made annually, payment decisions delegated to regional offices, and\
  \ training required for personnel. For the Whistleblower Payments program, this\
  \ assessment was due to the complexity of the program, a change in the process for\
  \ funding payments, and training required for personnel. \n\nFor FY 2024, CFTC’s\
  \ most significant payments were for payroll and benefits for its employees, which\
  \ are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center\
  \ (NFC) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and payments to vendors for\
  \ goods and services used during normal operations. CFTC’s other most significant\
  \ payments are for monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provided\
  \ the CFTC with original information about violations of the CEA that led the CFTC\
  \ to bring enforcement actions that resulted in monetary sanctions exceeding $1\
  \ million.  \n\nSignificant erroneous payments are defined as annual erroneous payments\
  \ in the program exceeding both $10 million and 1.5 percent, or $100 million of\
  \ total annual program payments.  Although the Commission disbursed $48.5 million\
  \ in whistleblower payments during FY 2024, the review of each individual award\
  \ by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff as well as multiple approval levels limits\
  \ the likelihood that the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments. In addition, based on the results of transaction testing applied\
  \ to a sample of FY 2024 vendor payments, consideration of risk factors, and reliance\
  \ on the internal controls in place over the payment and disbursement processes,\
  \ the Commission has determined that its programs and activities carried out in\
  \ the normal course of business have a low risk of being susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.\n\nAppendix C of\
  \ Circular A-123 states that the Commission is not required to determine a statistically\
  \ valid estimate of erroneous payments or develop a corrective action plan if the\
  \ program is not susceptible to significant improper payments. Appendix C also states\
  \ that if a low-risk program experiences a significant change in legislation and/or\
  \ a significant increase in its funding level, agencies are required to re-assess\
  \ the program’s risk susceptibility during the next annual cycle, even if it is\
  \ less than three years from the last risk assessment. The Commission regularly\
  \ reviews any changes to its programs in between preparing formal risk assessments\
  \ to identify whether a new risk assessment should be conducted."
