detail_ara2_3: The NRC conducted a risk assessment in FY 2023 and discovered no significant
  improper payments and no high/ medium risk programs. Based on those results and
  the substantial cost of conducting recapture audits, the agency determined that
  recovery or recapture audits are not cost effective. The NRC conducts risk assessments
  every 3 years as required by PIIA.

detail_dpa5: NRC’s Acquisitions Management Division does not use Do Not Pay (DNP)
  but does use other mechanisms to determine which vendors should be considered in
  doing business with as required by the FAR. Once a contract is signed, NRC is obligated
  to pay a valid contract invoice within 30 days of receipt per the Prompt Payment
  Act.  The NRC’s payment vendor file is used within DNP quarterly.  NRC has not found
  any improper payments because of using DNP. NRC consistently makes proper payments
  of approximately 99% annually.
detail_exs1: 'NRC’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with
  the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance
  audit. PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with
  annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once
  every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.
  Historically all of NRC programs have been deemed low risk and the NRC conducts
  a risk assessment on a triennial basis to determine whether any programs were susceptible
  to making significant improper payments.


  The FY 2023 risk assessment did not identify any programs that were susceptible
  to making significant improper payments. Although the results of the FY 2023 risk
  assessment identified NRC programs as low risk, NRC continues to monitor its payment
  processes, in addition to conducting periodic reviews of key controls for PIIA programs
  identified by management. The agency will continue to conduct a risk assessment
  on a triennial basis, in accordance with PIIA and OMB guidance. The next NRC PIIA
  risk assessment will take place in FY 2026. In addition, risk assessments evaluating
  new programs or programs that experience any significant legislative changes and/or
  significant increase in funding will be done to determine if the NRC continues to
  be at low risk for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold
  levels set by PIIA. Lastly, the NRC maintains payment integrity through strong prepayment
  controls and continuous monitoring.'
