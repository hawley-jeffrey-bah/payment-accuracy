detail_dpa5: NRC’s Acquisitions Management Division does not use Do Not Pay (DNP)
  but does use other mechanisms to determine which vendors should be considered in
  doing business with as required by the FAR. Once a contract is signed, NRC is obligated
  to pay a valid contract invoice within 30 days of receipt per the Prompt Payment
  Act. The NRC’s payment vendor file is used within DNP quarterly. NRC has not found
  any improper payments because of using DNP. NRC consistently makes proper payments
  of approximately 99% annually.
detail_exs1: 'NRC’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with
  the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance
  audit. PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with
  annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once
  every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.
  Historically all of NRC programs have been deemed low risk and the NRC conducts
  a risk assessment on a triennial basis to determine whether any programs were susceptible
  to making significant improper payments.


  The FY 2024 preliminary risk assessment did not identify any programs that were
  susceptible to making significant improper payments. Although the results of the
  FY 2024 preliminary risk assessment identified NRC programs as low risk, NRC continues
  to monitor its payment processes, in addition to conducting periodic reviews of
  key controls for PIIA programs identified by management. The agency will continue
  to conduct a risk assessment on a triennial basis, in accordance with PIIA and OMB
  guidance. The next NRC PIIA risk assessment will take place in FY 2026. In addition,
  risk assessments evaluating new programs or programs that experience any significant
  legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will be done to determine
  if the NRC continues to be at low risk for making significant improper payments
  at or above the threshold levels set by PIIA. Lastly, the NRC maintains payment
  integrity through strong pre-payment controls and continuous monitoring.'

detail_pcp14: OIG did not provide any recommendations to further improve prevention
  and reduction of improper payments.
detail_raa8: 'No'
detail_raa9: The risk assessment was not a comprehensive but assessed whether the

  Additionally, if there were any changes to laws and regulations and/or new programs
  enacted.
