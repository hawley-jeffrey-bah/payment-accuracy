detail_ara2_3: The NRC conducted a risk assessment in FY 2020 and discovered no significant
  improper payments. Based on no improper payments at the NRC and the substantial
  cost of conducting recapture audits, the agency determined that recovery or recapture
  audits are not cost effective. The NRC conducts risk assessments every 3 years as
  required by PIIA.

detail_dpa5: The NRC uses the Treasury’s Do Not Pay automated tools to monitor and
  reduce improper payments. This process has not resulted in the capture of any improper
  payments. Instead, the NRC captures improper payments through the agency’s internal
  controls.
detail_exs1: In accordance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)
  the NRC conducts a risk assessment to determine whether any programs were susceptible
  to making significant improper payments on a triennial basis. The NRC conducted
  the latest risk assessment in FY 2020. The FY 2020 risk assessment did not identify
  any programs that were susceptible to making significant improper payments. The
  next NRC PIIA risk assessment will take place in FY 2023.
