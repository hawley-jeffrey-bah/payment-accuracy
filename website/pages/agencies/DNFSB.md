detail_dpa5: In FY2024, DNFSB did not use the Do Not Pay (DNP) initiative portal.
  However, prior to making a new contract/award, DNFSB checked all procurements on
  the System for Award Management (SAM) database to confirm if a contractor is debarred.  Currently,
  DNFSB is transitioning to the Department of Interior, Interior Business Center (DOI/IBC)
  for accounting system support and accounts payable processing.  As part of the transition,
  DNFSB will implement the DNP initiative in FY2025. Prior to making a new contract
  award, DNFSB will utilize the SAM database to see if the vendor is excluded from
  receiving contracts and will verify vendors on the Department of Treasury’s DNP
  database.
detail_exs1: 'DNFSB conducts periodic review of all programs and activities to identify
  those that may be susceptible to improper payments.  In performed a risk assessment
  of outlays exceeding $10 million, based on OMB guidance M-21-19, annual Improper
  Payment Fiscal Year 2023, DNFSB (IP) or Unknown Payment (UP) above $10,000,000 and
  1.5% of the program’s total annual outlays are above the statutory threshold.  As
  a result, the overall DNFSB risk score is low, below the statutory threshold, and
  is deemed not susceptible to improper payments; comprehensive risk assessments are
  not required for any DNFSB programs.  The next risk assessment is scheduled for
  FY2026.


  In FY2024, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted the Performance Audit
  of DNFSB’s compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) requirements
  for FY 2023. The OIG assessed DNFSB’s compliance with OMB guidance and corresponding
  reporting instructions and determined that DNFSB met the applicable requirements
  for PIIA. The OIG found DNFSB’s reporting of and performance in reducing and recapturing
  IPs and UPs to be generally accurate and complete.
