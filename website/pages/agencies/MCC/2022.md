detail_ara2_3: MCC does not have any funds susceptible to significant improper payments
  based on the latest risk assessment.  MCC conducts independent audits on compact
  and threshold programs on an annual basis, sometimes semi-annually depending on
  the age of the program.  These audits are reviewed for questioned costs and other
  improper payments, and tracked as necessary.   The other MCC funds historically
  have very low annual overpayments.  Therefore, MCC concluded recovery audits would
  not be cost effective and benefit MCC's internal control structure for all funds.

detail_dpa5: On a weekly basis, IBC uploads MCC Payment batches into the DO NOT PAY
  Portal.  Treasury returns the payment batches to IBC who uploads the files in Oracle
  and advises MCC that the files are available.  MCC downloads the Payment Activity
  Report monthly from the DO NOT PAY Portal and reviews the list for items in need
  of adjudication.  Flagged payments or payments listed as possible matches are reviewed
  with the respective MCC division making the payment before a determination is reported
  to Treasury on the portal.  Although payments can be flagged, the system often either
  produces false positive or inaccurate probable matches.  Therefore, MCC vendors
  are vetted in other databases like SAM which is more accurate prior to award and
  payments.
detail_exs1: MCC conducts a risk assessment for all programs with outlays over $10
  million on a three year risk assessment cycle.  Based on the most recent risk assessments,
  MCC does not have any programs which are likely to be susceptible to significant
  improper payments.
