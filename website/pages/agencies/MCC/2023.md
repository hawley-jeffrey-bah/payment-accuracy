detail_agy1: MCC reduced its overpayments from 0.85M in FY 2021 to .01M in FY 2023.  The
  trend illustrates the strength of MCC's internal controls and oversight.  Although
  the data depicts a reduced recovery rate in FY 2023, this is the result of the smaller
  overpayment population due to MCC’s success in reducing overpayments.  MCC will
  continue to diligently work to recover the remaining funds.

detail_ara2_3: MCC concluded recovery audits would not be cost effective and benefit
  MCC's internal control structure for all funds.  Based on the latest risk assessments
  conducted in FY 2023, MCC does not have any funds susceptible to significant improper
  payments. MCC conducts independent audits on compact and threshold programs on an
  annual basis.  These audits are reviewed for questioned costs and other improper
  payments, and tracked as necessary. The other MCC funds historically have very low
  annual overpayments.

detail_dpa5: 'On a weekly basis, IBC uploads MCC Payment batches into the DO NOT PAY
  Portal. Treasury returns the payment batches to IBC who uploads the files in Oracle
  and advises MCC that the files are available. MCC downloads the Payment Activity
  Report monthly from the DO NOT PAY Portal and reviews the list

  for items in need of adjudication. Flagged payments or payments listed as possible
  matches are reviewed with the respective MCC division making the payment before
  a determination is reported to Treasury on the portal. Although payments can be
  flagged, the system often either produces false positive or inaccurate probable
  matches. Therefore, MCC vendors are vetted in other databases like SAM which is
  more accurate prior to award and payments.  MCC did not identify any improper payments
  as a result of the Do Not Pay Initiative.'
detail_exs1: The USAID Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the agency
  was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most
  recent compliance audit.  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs
  and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment
  risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant
  improper payments.  Because MCC last completed a risk assessment on its programs
  in FY 2020, MCC conducted a risk assessment on five programs during FY 2023.  These
  programs are Compact Assistance, Compact Development Funding, Threshold, Due Diligence,
  and Administrative Fund.  As a result of the risk assessment, MCC identified no
  programs which are likely susceptible to significant improper payments.  Additional
  programs were below the $10 million threshold and were not assessed during this
  period.  MCC will evaluate the programs in FY 2024 to ensure no significant legislative
  changes and/or significant increase in funding to determine if the agency will need
  to reassess its risk posture or whether programs moved above the threshold levels
  set by PIIA.  MCC will continue to maintain a payment integrity environment with
  strong internal controls and low improper payments.
