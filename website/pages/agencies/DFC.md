detail_dpa5: DFC uses the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative to reduce the risk of improper
  payments. DFC disburses payments through its shared service provider, Department
  of Treasury, Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS), and its programmatic payments are
  validated against the DNP database prior to disbursement. In addition, DFC uses
  DNP as part of its due diligence activities by validating project counterparties
  against the DNP database prior to project commitment. DFC has not identified specific
  instances where the DNP Initiative has reduced improper payments or awards.
detail_exs1: DFC has designed and implemented internal controls to promote payment
  integrity and assesses the risk of payment integrity to its programs on an annual
  basis. The FY 2024 payment integrity risk assessment did not identify any programs
  that are likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. In FY 2024,
  DFC’s OIG assessed the Corporation’s payment integrity program and compliance with
  the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 and determined that DFC complied with
  the requirements of the statute and that the agency's payment integrity risk assessments
  utilized the criteria required by OMB Circular No. A-123 and conformed to OMB guidance
  for preventing and reducing improper payments.
