detail_ara2_1: 'The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS)
  has a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of
  activities performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of
  Management Analysis (MA). The subsequent review performed by MA focuses on overpayments
  and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While
  many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this
  function is performed more efficiently within the Department by MA. Because the
  MA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor
  would perform, MA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.


  Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments
  subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. MA utilizes several processes that
  focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part
  of the Recapture Audit process, MA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments
  using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against
  current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate
  payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has
  proven to be a cost-effective tool.


  In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, MA performs a manual quarterly review
  of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate
  elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure
  proper documentation exists to support sampled payments. However, in 2024, MA vendor
  recapture audit efforts identified $23 in overpayments, and only $12 was recovered
  and returned to the originating appropriation. MA also performs a quarterly manual
  recapture audit of employee claim payments subject to the Department’s overall travel
  program. This recapture audit focuses on known identified issue areas as well as
  providing overall audit coverage of employee travel payments.


  During 2024, MA built on prior year recapture audit activities by targeting additional
  payment aspects to ensure all document types are eligible for review. In addition,
  MA reviewed grant payments within the universe of the domestic and overseas payment
  program. The additional inclusion of automated and manual recapture audit processes
  ensures the Department has coverage in required PIIA recapture audit areas.

  The Office of Global Compensation (CGFS/GC) leverages an overpayment unit to review,
  calculate, and notify employees of salary or allowance overpayments. Salary overpayments
  occur for various reasons in the Department’s complex global pay environment, much
  is dependent on timely notification of events impacting pay. For example, late receipt
  of a cable notifying CGFS that an employee departed an overseas mission for official
  duty travel or on personal leave can result in an overpayment of allowances.

detail_dpa5: "The Department of State reviewed potential improper payments provided\
  \ by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments\
  \ through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2024, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed\
  \ 1,531,627 payments totaling $17.2 billion paid by the Department through the DNP\
  \ portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to\
  \ the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the\
  \ General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through\
  \ daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 190,340 unmatchable\
  \ payments, totaling $1.9 billion, and adjudicated 110 potential erroneous payment\
  \ matches as part of the post payment review process. \n\nThe Department continued\
  \ to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments.\
  \ At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against\
  \ the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed,\
  \ payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment\
  \ run. In 2024, there were 205,354 annuitant payments totaling $1.2 billion were\
  \ reviewed against the DMF and 248 payments totaling $6.5 million were stopped due\
  \ to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants\
  \ and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments\
  \ processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF\
  \ online search prior to making payment. \n\nFor non-Treasury Disbursing Office\
  \ oversees payments, payee information is checked against Treasury’s Office of Foreign\
  \ Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2024,\

detail_exs1: 'For more than a decade, laws and regulations governing the identification
  and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment
  accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments
  Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws, collectively
  required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities to identify
  those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment recapture
  audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives. The IPIA regulations
  also required extensive reporting requirements. OMB transformed the improper payment
  compliance framework to create a more unified, comprehensive, and less burdensome
  set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced by the Payment Integrity Information
  Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March 2, 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured
  existing improper payments laws to help agencies better identify and reduce any
  money wasted as a result of improper government payments. Not all improper payments
  are fraud, and not all improper payments represent a loss to the government. Generally,
  an improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made
  in an incorrect amount under a statutory, contractual, and administrative or other
  legally applicable requirement.


  The Department defines its programs and activities in alignment with the manner
  of funding received through appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for
  operations carried out around the world. Risk assessments over all programs are
  done every three years. In the interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs
  that experience any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase
  in funding will be done to determine if the Department continues to be at low risk
  for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by
  OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment of all programs and activities in
  2022 and 2024 was the third year of the three-year cycle. In 2024, the programs
  included: Foreign Locally Employed Staff Compensation; Economic Support Fund; Worldwide
  Security Protection; International Security Programs; International Cooperative
  Administrative Support Services; Consular and Border Security Programs; Consular
  Information Technology and Security; and Peacekeeping Operations Programs. After
  performing risk assessments for these programs, the Department determined that none
  of its programs in 2024 were risk-susceptible for making significant improper payments
  at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.


  Annually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented on
  the Payment Accuracy website by individual agency or on a Government-wide consolidated
  basis. This website contains current and historical information about improper payments
  made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information about how improper
  payments are defined and tracked. Please refer to the Payment Accuracy website for
  detailed results from the Department’s efforts in 2024 to comply with PIIA.
