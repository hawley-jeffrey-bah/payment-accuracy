  \ GBL. This effort is required by the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998.\
  \ Efforts continue with DOI’s Bureaus to ensure that all freight bills undergo prepayment\
  \ audits.\n\n•\tInvoice Payment Reviews. The DOI conducts various pre and post payment\
  \ reviews of vendor invoices across the Bureaus. The reviews are the responsibility\
  \ of the Bureaus and are used to identify inaccurate payments and determine the\
  \ effectiveness of internal controls over the payment process.\n\n•\tTravel Voucher\

detail_ara2_3: In FY 2014, the DOI conducted payment recapture audits for payments
  made in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 that resulted in a recapture rate of 0.0004
  percent. Based on the low rate of improper payments, DOI concluded that the cost
  of executing a payment recapture audit program outweighed the benefits of finding
  and recovering erroneous payments. The staff resources needed to conduct the program,
  sustain the contract, and oversee vendor payments were a significant drain on limited
  agency resources with minimal benefits to the government. In April 2014, OMB was
  notified that DOI discontinued the payment recapture audit program. The DOI continues
  to have a low improper payment rate and circumstances have not changed within our
  programs to make a payment recapture audit cost effective. As such, DOI did not
  perform recapture audits for improper payments this fiscal year. The DOI will continue
  complying with PIIA through the OMB Circular A-123 process as a more cost effective
  and efficient use of agency resources to identify, reduce, and recover improper
  payments.

  Do Not Pay Federal Reserve Representative and the Treasury Representative as a way
  to determine if DOI is using Do Not Pay Initiative to the fullest extent. The meetings
  were very informative and the DOI Bureaus/Offices have requested access to the Do
  Not Pay Portal to perform individual searches and send separate specific payment
  files to bump up against the many Do Not Pay databases to determine if there are
  any improper payments in advance of the payment being issued.'
detail_exs1: "Payment Integrity and Phase 1 Risk Assessments\n\nOn March 5, 2021,\
  \ the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued an update to Appendix C of Circular\
  \ A-123 (Appendix C) in OMB Memorandum M-21-19 Requirements for Payment Integrity\
  \ Improvement. Appendix C requires agencies to review all programs and activities\
  \ for the risk of improper payment by performing assessments to determine whether\
  \ those programs are “susceptible to significant improper payments.” Due to the\
  \ DOI’s historic low risk of improper payments, the DOI conducts comprehensive risk\
  \ assessments on a three-year cycle of all agency programs with payments greater\
  \ than $10 million during the assessment period (In Cycle Risk Assessment). With\
  \ OMB concurrence, DOI utilizes an alternative annual assessment period from quarter\
  \ 4 of the prior fiscal year through quarter 3 of the current fiscal year. \n\n\
  In FY 2018, based upon OIG audit recommendations, the DOI launched a new SharePoint\
  \ tool to assess the susceptibility of programs to significant improper payments\
  \ utilizing a qualitative risk analysis. In FY 2021, DOI rebuilt the PIIA SharePoint\
  \ consistent with OMB’s FY 2021 Appendix C update. The new PIIA SharePoint utilizes\
  \ the thirteen risk factors identified in Appendix C to assess a program’s susceptibility\
  \ to improper payment. For FY 2022, the DOI utilized a risk assessment methodology\
  \ that equally weighs the thirteen Appendix C risk factors to yield each program’s\
  \ overall score as either high, medium, or low risk of susceptibility to significant\
  \ improper payments. In addition, DOI considers the results of reviews under the\
  \ Single Audit Amendments Act of 1996, the CFO Act, GAO reviews, and OIG audit reviews\
  \ when making its assessment of program risk.\n\nIn FY 2022, the OIG determined\
  \ the Department was compliant with the PIIA and Appendix C reporting requirements\
  \ including the agency’s FY 2021 Off Cycle payment integrity Phase 1 Risk Assessments\
  \ of (25) new programs. In its report, OIG made two recommendations for the Department\
  \ including: (1) Reassess the use of an equally weighted qualitative factor approach\
  \ in its payment integrity risk assessment methodology to determine if it is appropriate\
  \ and provides reasonable assurance that it will identify programs at high risk\
  \ of improper or under payment; and (2) Revise the payment integrity risk assessment\
  \ methodology to include sufficient justification for the approach selected and\
  \ used. DOI concurred with the OIG recommendations, and in FY 2023 will reassess\
  \ the Department’s equally weighted qualitative risk factor approach to our payment\
  \ integrity risk assessments and will implement applicable updates to our Payment\
  \ Integrity SharePoint site.\n\nIn FY 2022, DOI completed an In Cycle Appendix C\
  \ Phase 1 Risk Assessment of all DOI programs with over $10 million in outlays for\
  \ the assessment period of Quarter 4 of FY 2021 through Quarter 3 of FY 2022 (assessment\
  \ period). A total of one hundred and ten (110) program risk assessments were performed\
  \ in the PIIA SharePoint, with a total of $28,109.33 million in outlays for the\
  \ assessment period. The 110 risk assessments included eight (8) embedded programs\
  \ funded through Pandemic Relief legislation with a total of $225.95 million in\
  \ outlays for the assessment period. None of the 110 risk assessments performed\
  \ in FY 2022 resulted in a program being identified as being at high risk of susceptibility\
  \ to significant improper payments, with no new programs requiring Appendix C Phase\
  \ 2 Testing in FY 2023. \n\nPayment Integrity and Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing\n\
  \nDOI is required to design and implement appropriate statistical sampling and estimation\
  \ methods to produce statistically valid improper payment estimates for all programs\
  \ and activities determined to be “susceptible to significant improper payments”\
  \ through Appendix C Phase 2 Testing. DOI employs a testing methodology using statistical\
  \ sampling to estimate the amount and percentage of improper payments based on the\
  \ prior year’s program expenditures. In developing its sampling and estimation plans,\
  \ DOI consults with a certified statistician to ensure its testing methodology will\
  \ produce statistically valid improper payment estimates. \n\nIn FY 2020, the Bipartisan\
  \ Budget Act of 2018 initiated a Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing requirement\
  \ for DOI programs funded under the “emergency supplemental appropriations to respond\
  \ to and recover from recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters” (DRA program).\
  \ In FY 2020, the DOI performed Phase 2 Statistical Sample Testing of the DRA program’s\
  \ FY 2019 expenditures that resulted in an overall error rate of 0.07 percent with\
  \ a statistically estimated $.0185 million in improper payments against total program\
  \ outlays of $27.44 million. These results were achieved with a precision rate of\
  \ 1.58% with a 95% confidence level. The testing of the DRA program established\
  \ a baseline improper payment rate of 0.07 percent for this program, significantly\
  \ below the statutory threshold required for continued Phase 2 Testing of the program.\
  \ Consistent with Section II.C.3. of Appendix C (see Table 2 and page 19 of M-21-19).\
  \ In FY 2021 and continuing in FY 2022, the Department moved from Phase 2 Testing\
  \ of the DRA program to Phase 1 risk assessment of DRA funded programs with greater\
  \ than $10M in expenditures for the current assessment period.\n\nThe Hurricane\
  \ Sandy Disaster Relief Act is the only other DOI program currently identified as\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments in OMB Memorandum M-13-07. In FY\
  \ 2016, DOI performed statistical sampling of the Hurricane Sandy FY 2015 program\
  \ expenditures and projected an improper payment rate of $565 thousand or 0.41%\
  \ out of a total $137 million in program payments. Due to the program’s low estimated\
  \ improper payment rate, with OIG concurrence, DOI requested and was granted relief\
  \ from OMB reporting requirements including further sampling and estimation. As\
  \ a result, Phase 2 Testing does not apply to DOI for the Hurricane Sandy Relief\
  \ Act program and is excluded accordingly.\n\nDOI’s FY 2019 through FY 2021 Appendix\
  \ C Phase 1 Risk Assessments found no program at high risk of susceptibility to\
  \ significant improper payments requiring Phase 2 Testing in FY 2022; and as noted\
  \ above, no program was identified for FY 2023.\n\nDOI's Appendix C internal controls\
  \ and monitoring over the payment process in FBMS and GrantSolutions business and\
  \ payment systems are reviewed on a regular basis and remain effective.  The minimal\
  \ amount of overpayments across all agency programs when DRA and other programs\
  \ underwent Phase 2 Testing validate that the agency's OMB A-123 internal control\
  \ procedures and commitment to established risk reduction measures are both appropriate\
  \ and effective.\n"
