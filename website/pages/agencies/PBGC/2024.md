detail_ara2_3: 'Benefit Payments disburses over $5 billion in payments annually to
  over 800,000 participants each month.

  Due to the dollar value, payment volume, program complexity, and nature of pension
  payments, PBGC has implemented electronic data analysis, including death match and
  other procedures, to identify

  payments that may be in error. Potential improper payments are subjected to further
  analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error,
  and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established
  procedures to recapture overpayments through recovery payments, installment repayment
  agreements, offsets against other continuing benefits to recoup amounts owed by
  the participant, or referrals to the Department of Treasury’s Centralized Receivables
  Service. In some cases, recapture of payments may not be sought based on demonstration
  that a participant is experiencing financial hardship or other reasons.


  Contractor Payments includes the disbursement of over $300 million annually. Due
  to the dollar value, payment volume, and the nature of contract payments, PBGC has
  implemented electronic data analysis,

  including do not pay matching and other procedures, to identify payments that may
  be in error. In addition, invoice reviews are periodically performed to help assess
  the accuracy of amounts billed. Potential improper payments are subjected to further
  analysis based on the amount of the payment, the nature of the potential error,
  and other risk factors to determine whether amounts are due to PBGC. PBGC has established
  procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to seek reimbursement
  from contractors that have been overpaid. Further, under the FAR, previous payments
  are made are generally subject to adjustment based on over or under payments and
  any amounts due are normally addressed prior to or at contract closeout.


  Payments to Federal Employees includes disbursement of about $150 million annually.
  PBGC’s payroll and other employee payments are processed by the Department of the
  Interior’s (DOI) Interior Business Center (IBC). PBGC receives a Statement on Standards
  for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 report that reports on the DOI IBC payment
  operations. No weaknesses related to payroll and other employee payments were reported
  in the most recent SSAE No. 18. Included in PBGC’s and DOI’s internal controls are
  that a series of personnel actions are needed to change salaries or process bonus
  payments. Also, employees receive a payroll statement every two weeks. While mistakes
  can occur in any operation, PBGC has not experienced significant levels of improper
  payroll payments. Also, if a mistake is identified, any overpayments can be netted
  against or offset future payments to those employees or deducted from the last paycheck
  processed after termination. A review of the following did not identify significant
  payment issues:

  >Improper payment risk assessments,

  >agency Inspector General reviews,

  >Government Accountability Office reports, and

  >results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.


  Given the historic low risk nature of payroll disbursements, including the existence
  of adequate payment processing controls and reviews, and the ability to readily
  recover any improper payments by offset

  against future payments through normal payroll operations, establishing a separate
  payment recapture program for this payment stream is unnecessary and would not be
  cost effective.


  Multiemployer Plan Financial Assistance includes disbursement of over $160 million
  per year. MEPD generally processes an average of 357 financial assistance payments
  annually to an average of 95 plans. Multiemployer plans are required to provide
  proof of plan insolvency, sign promissory agreements, and undergo an initial audit
  to determine if the plan is eligible to receive ongoing assistance from the PBGC.

  Additionally, multiemployer plans are required to provide documentation to support
  estimates of future expenses prior to receiving financial assistance on a yearly,
  semi annually, quarterly, or monthly basis.

  The PBGC’s Multiemployer Program Division (MEPD) reviews all financial assistance
  requests in accordance with established policies and procedures to verify requests
  are reasonable, complete, accurate, and comply with ERISA. MEPD rejects or reduces
  the amount of financial assistance requested by plans if the administrative and/or
  benefit expenses do not agree to supporting documentation or if there was a prior
  overpayment. Additionally, throughout the year, plans submit documentation to support
  actual expenses incurred to validate a plan’s previous estimate of plan expenses
  and adjust the most recent financial assistance request amount if the actual amount
  of expenses significantly varied from the plan’s initial estimate, and MEPD auditors
  review this documentation and perform a detailed reconciliation.

  Multiemployer plans are insolvent and generally have no other sources of financial
  resources beyond PBGC. In addition, there are just over 100 plans, so this is not
  a large universe of payees to monitor within the existing structure. A review of
  the following did not identify significant payment issues:

  >improper payment risk assessment

  >agency Inspector General reviews,

  >Government Accountability Office reports, and

  >results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.

  Given the lower payment dollar value and volume, the nature of the multiemployer
  plan financial assistance program, payment processing controls, and the ability
  to adjust future financial assistance

  amounts by actual expenses incurred, establishing a separate payment recapture program
  for this payment stream would not be considered cost effective.


  Premium Refunds issued ranges roughly $88 to $203 million on an annual basis. All
  premium refund requests are subject to review prior to disbursement with larger
  payments subjected to additional

  approvals. Given that each pension plan has an ongoing account with PBGC as to premium
  amounts due, any adjustments for under or over payments can be reflected in the
  PBGC’s Statement of Account for each plan. Plans may contest any attempt to recapture
  overpayments. A review of the following did not identify significant payment issues:

  > Improper payment risk assessments,

  > agency Inspector General reviews,

  > Government Accountability Office reports, and

  > results of the agency audit resolution and follow up process.


  Based on above and especially since there is not significant dollar value or payment
  volume associated with this payment stream, establishing a separate payment recapture
  program for this payment stream is not considered cost effective.'

  Operations Department (FOD) consults with

detail_exs1: 'The PBGC Inspector General concluded in its report issued on May 1,
  2024, that the agency was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of
  2019 (PIIA) in the OIG''s most recent evaluation

  of the agency''s Payment Integrity risk assessment conducted in FY 2023.

  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual
  outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three
  years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.

  In FY 2024, PBGC performed a risk assessment of three payment streams in accordance
  with our three-year rotation strategy. The three payment streams reviewed during
  FY 2024 were Multiemployer Special

  Financial Assistance Payments, Benefit Payments and Premium Refunds. In performing
  the risk assessments, PBGC considered factors specified in statute and further defined
  in OMB guidance, including the

  complexity of the payment stream; the volume of payments; recent major changes in
  program funding, authorities, practices, or procedures; the level, experience, and
  quality of training for personnel responsible

  for making program eligibility determinations or certifying that payments are accurate;
  whether the program is new to the agency; whether payments or payment eligibility
  decisions are made outside of PBGC; significant deficiencies in the audit reports
  issued by the PBGC Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability
  Office (GAO); similarities to other programs that have reported improper

  payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) estimates; the accuracy and reliability
  of IP and UP estimates previously reported for the program; whether the program
  lacks information or data systems to confirm eligibility; and the risk of fraud
  as assessed by the agency under the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal
  Government published by the Government Accountability Office.

  Based on the results of the Phase 1 risk assessments, PBGC determined that the Multiemployer
  Special Financial Assistance Payments, Benefit Payments and Premium Refunds were
  not susceptible to significant risk of improper payments as defined by the law and
  OMB implementation guidance.'
