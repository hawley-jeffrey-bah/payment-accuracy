  - Barriers: There are no barriers prohibiting improving prevention of Improper Payments
      for this Program. These Improper Payments were largely due to rounding errors.
      The small amounts identified relative to the program outlays would not usually
      present an opportunity to efficiently use resources to attempt to recover.
    Info: There are no specific Financial Eligibility criteria that was not met for
      these improper payments. The Department identified a number of payments with
      small rounding errors. The small amounts identified relative to the program
      outlays would not usually present an opportunity to efficiently use resources

- Program_Name: Federal Pell Grant Program
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The Pell Grant program structure per the Higher Education Act of 1965
      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). FSA must
      continue to rely on controls established by external entities that receive funds
      and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including the Pell Grant program.
      These entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will

      continue to leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance
      audits to identify and address root causes of improper payments made by external
      entities.

      FSA has the internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other
      infrastructure to reduce improper payments that are within FSA’s control. FSA
      has established an integrated system of complementary oversight functions to
      help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance by all
      participating institutions.

    Info: 'Education eligibility requirements for federal student aid include:

      - enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible degree
      or certificate program;

      - maintain satisfactory academic progress in college or career school;

      - demonstrate qualification to obtain a college or career school education;

      - status as a full-time or part-time student, and

      - plans to attend school for a full academic year or less.'

  - Barriers: 'FSA maintains a robust internal control framework which includes performing
      computer matches performed in FSA systems against external sources during the
      aid delivery process which prevent financial eligibility root cause-related
      improper payments.

      Historically, FSA has had to rely on the applicant to post their income data
      on the FAFSA or to import themselves from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
      using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. A significant percentage of Pell improper
      payments result from the applicant misreporting their income. In December 2019,
      Congress passed the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
      Education Act (FUTURE Act), which amends Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue
      Code (IRC) to allow the IRS to disclose certain federal tax information (FTI)
      to FSA. FSA continues to work diligently and collaboratively with the IRS to
      implement and operationalize changes to its programs and systems as a result
      of the FUTURE Act, such as new data-sharing agreements, technologies, and protocols
      which FSA expects will allow for significant simplification of and improvement
      to the administration of Title IV programs, significantly mitigating the risk
      of these types of improper payments in the future.

      '
    Info: 'Financial eligibility requirements for federal student aid include but
      are not limited to:

      - demonstrate financial need;

      - sign the certification statement on the Free Application for Federal Student
      Aid (FAFSA) form stating that you are not in default on a federal student loan,
      you do not owe money on a federal student grant, and you will use federal student
      aid only for educational purposes;

      - Income/Expected Family Contribution; and

      - the cost of attendance (determined by your school).'

detail_exs1: "Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William\
  \ D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per\
  \ OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments\
  \ (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2023 are related to misreported income, credit\
  \ balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal\
  \ deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior\
  \ year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate\
  \ and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, FSA is in\
  \ the process of implementing the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to directly\
  \ authenticate applicants’ and borrowers’ income data. IPs and UPs that are outside\
  \ of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that are\
  \ responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to provide\
  \ training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual Conference,\
  \ and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet FSA requirements\
  \ for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.\
  \  \n\nThe FY 2023 IP and UP rate for the Pell program is 2.83% up from 2.24% in\
  \ FY 2022. The increase in the FY 2023 Pell estimate over FY 2022 is primarily due\
  \ to an increase in misreported income root cause over and underpayments as derived\
  \ from an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Free Application for Federal Student Aid\
  \ (FAFSA) Statistical Study that compares recipients’ self-reported income data\
  \ to their Federal tax information (FTI) maintained by the IRS.  The FY2023 IP and\
  \ UP rate for the Direct Loan program is 0.70%, down from 0.75% in FY 2022.  The\
  \ decrease in the FY 2023 Direct Loan estimate from FY 2022 is primarily due to\
  \ a decrease in overpayments as derived from compliance audit data.  \n\nThe Department\
  \ also estimated the FY 2023 IP and UP rates for three non-FSA Phase 2 programs:\
  \ Title I, Part A (Title I), Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), and the Special\
  \ Education Grants to States program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\
  \ Act (IDEA). The FY 2023 IP and UP rates for the Title I, ESF, and IDEA programs\
  \ are 0.00004%, 0.0002%, and 0.0001%, down from FY 2022 rates of 35.72%, 12.09%,\
  \ and 26.71%, respectively.  \n\nIn FY 2022, the primary driver of the high reported\
  \ estimated IP and UP rates reported was Unknown Payments resulting from a lack\
  \ of documentation (due to the delayed start of the payment integrity studies) and\
  \ the payment recipients not understanding what type of supporting documentation\
  \ to provide to satisfy the requirements of the studies. In response to the FY 2022\
  \ results, the Department implemented effective mitigation strategies in FY 2023\
  \ which resulted in the elimination of UPs in these 3 programs. This dramatically\
  \ reduced the estimated IP and UP rates in FY 2023. The strategies the Department\
  \ implemented are as follows:\n\n1. The Department began the FY 2023 payment integrity\
  \ studies earlier in the fiscal year, providing sufficient time for State Education\
  \ Agencies (SEAs) to obtain and provide supporting documentation from Local Education\
  \ Agencies (LEAs) for the programs’ payments.\n\n2. The Department provided SEAs\
  \ with targeted technical assistance and training throughout FY 2023. This assistance\
  \ encompassed technical assistance meetings with certain states, written guidance,\
  \ and payment documentation criteria guidance.\n\nAs a direct result of these strategies,\
  \ the Department is currently reporting extremely low FY 2023 rates, mainly attributed\
  \ to a small number of payment rounding errors. In addition, the Department formally\
  \ issued its policy on Payment Integrity, providing guidance to agency employees,\
  \ in FY 2023.\n\nFinally, the Department continues its efforts to collect confirmed\
  \ IPs. Regarding payment recapture audits, the Department has determined that these\
  \ types of audits would not be cost effective for any of its programs and activities.\
  \ However, the Department identifies and recovers IPs through sources other than\
  \ payment recapture audits and works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants\
  \ to resolve and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and\
  \ program reviews. The Department also analyzes the return of grant funds from recipients\
  \ to determine if they are due to IPs. When an IP is detected and deemed collectable,\
  \ the Department establishes an account receivable and pursues collection. Additionally,\
  \ the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect IPs from grantees\
  \ in cases where it determines that pursuing collections would cause more harm to\
  \ the federal interest."
