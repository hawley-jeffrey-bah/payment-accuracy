  \ the Improper Payments Strategy.\n\nImproper Payments Strategy  \n\nThe Payment\
  \ Integrity Information Act requires agencies to conduct payment recapture audits\
  \ with respect to each program and activity of the agency with expenditures of $1\
  \ million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective. \
  \ The STB addresses proper management of payments by: \n\n*preventing payment errors\

detail_exs1: "Payment Integrity  \n\nThe information presented in this report complies\
  \ with guidance provided in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019; OMB Circular\
  \ A-136, and Appendix C to OMB Circular A-123, M21-19, Requirements for Payment\
  \ Integrity Improvement.  \n\n \n\nThe guidance requires agencies to assess every\
  \ Federal program with annual outlays greater than $10 million dollars, at least\
  \ triennially, for improper payment risk, measure the accuracy of payments annually,\
  \ and initiate program improvements to ensure payment integrity.  On November 20,\
  \ 2009, Executive Order 13520, Reducing Improper Payments and Eliminating Waste\
  \ in Federal Programs, was issued for the purpose of intensifying efforts to eliminate\
  \ payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse in the major programs administered by the\
  \ Federal government, while continuing to ensure that the right people receive the\
  \ right payment for the right reason at the right time.  The supporting website,\
  \ https://paymentaccuracy.gov/, contains the following information:  \n\nCurrent\
  \ and historical rates and amounts of improper payments for Federal agencies;  \n\
  \nWhy improper payments occur; and  \n\nWhat agencies are doing to reduce and recover\
  \ improper payments.  \n\nProgram Review  \n\nThe STB has only one program for budget\
  \ purposes.  The FY 2023 appropriated funding for the program is $41.429 million.\
  \  All the agency’s transactions are either employee payroll and benefits, intragovernmental,\
  \ or non-Federal transactions.  \n\n \n\nThe STB does not maintain its own financial\
  \ management system but uses a shared service provider, ESC, to process all accounting\
  \ transactions and the DOI processes payroll and benefits.  ESC is subject to external\
  \ audit in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18,\
  \ Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification.  The STB examines the\
  \ SSAE No. 18 audit results annually to determine if the shared service provider’s\
  \ internal controls are operating effectively.  The Board also evaluates the internal\
  \ controls required to supplement the shared service provider’s controls as outlined\
  \ in the SSAE 18.  \n\n \n\nIntra-governmental transactions, accounts payables,\
  \ and payments to agency employees are reviewed as part of the agency’s internal\
  \ control program under OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A, Internal Control over Financial\
  \ Reporting and Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement.  \n\n\
  \ \n\nBased on OMB Circular A-123, the STB’s program was reviewed to identify those\
  \ activities that were susceptible to significant improper payments.  For FY 2023,\
  \ the STB Federal and non-Federal payment was $14 million, and payroll was $26.4\
  \ million for a combined total of $40.4 million.  The Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act defines “significant” as either (1) improper payments that exceed both $10\
  \ million and 1.5% of program disbursements; or (2) improper payments in excess\
  \ of $100 million.  Significant improper payments in the STB’s program needed to\
  \ exceed both $0.6 million (1.5% improper payment rate) and $10 million of all non-Federal\
  \ payments and payments to Federal employees.  No material improper payments were\
  \ identified by the STB in FY 2023 for significant improper payment reporting. \n\
  \n \n\nIn addition, the following risk factors, likely to contribute to improper\
  \ payments, were applied to the STB’s appropriated funds.   \n\nAny new programs\
  \ or activity in the agency.  \n\nComplexity of the activity with respect to correct\
  \ payments amounts.  \n\nVolume of payments made annually.  \n\nRecent major changes\
  \ in activity funding, authority, practice, or procedures.  \n\nLevel, experience,\
  \ and quality of training for personnel responsible for certifying that payments\
  \ are accurate.  \n\nInherent risks of improper payments due to the nature of agency\
  \ operations.  \n\nSignificant deficiencies in the audit reports of the agency that\
  \ included Inspector General audit findings or external financial audit findings.\
  \  \n\nResults from prior improper payment work.  \n\nIn FY 2023, zero (-) improper\
  \ payments were discovered.  The STB will continue evaluating its programs based\
  \ on identified risk factors to prevent improper payments from occurring, but the\
  \ overall risk is low/not significant.  \n\nImproper Payments Strategy  \n\nThe\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act requires agencies to conduct payment recapture\
  \ audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency with expenditures\
  \ of $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.\
  \  The STB addresses proper management of payments by: \n\npreventing payment errors\
  \ through documented processes and internal controls; and \n\ndetecting overpayment\
  \ and underpayments through control testing. \n\nDue to the STB’s limited staffing\
  \ levels for its accounting and financial reporting functions, such support services\
  \ are provided under contract with ESC.  Coordinating with ESC has greatly enhanced\
  \ the STB's capabilities for identification of improper payments using detailed\
  \ internal controls at both the STB and ESC.  The STB obtains contracting support\
  \ from DOT, which follows established pre-enrollment, preaward, and pre-payment\
  \ processes for all acquisition awards.  Preenrollment procedures include cross\
  \ referencing applicants against the GSA System for Award Management (SAM) exclusion\
  \ records.  ESC reviews Federal and commercial databases to verify past performance,\
  \ Federal government debt, integrity, and business ethics.  For prepayment processes,\
  \ ESC verifies an entity against both SAM and the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer\
  \ Identification Number Match Program before establishing the entity as a vendor\
  \ in its core financial accounting system. \n\nRecapture of Improper Payments Reporting\
  \  \n\nThe Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 requires agencies to conduct\
  \ recovery audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency that expends\
  \ $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.\
  \  \n\nOnce the STB has identified an improper payment with a non-Federal vendor,\
  \ it is STB’s policy to aggressively correct the improper payment.  Upon research\
  \ and analysis of supporting documentation, the vendor is contacted for resolution\
  \ (in the case of underpayment to the agency).  If the contract is ongoing, the\
  \ Board will offset the amount to be recovered on the next billing.  For all other\
  \ contracts, the vendor is contacted, and a receivable is established for collection.\
  \  If the vendor does not provide payment, the debt is entered into the Treasury\
  \ Offset Program.  If an improper payment is identified as an overpayment to the\
  \ STB, the vendor is promptly paid."
