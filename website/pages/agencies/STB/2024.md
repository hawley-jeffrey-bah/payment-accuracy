detail_exs1: "The information presented in this report complies with guidance provided\
  \ in the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019; OMB Circular A-136, and Appendix\
  \ C to OMB Circular A-123, M-21-19, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement.\n\
  The guidance requires agencies to assess every Federal program with annual outlays\
  \ greater than $10 million dollars, at least triennially, for improper payment risk,\
  \ measure the accuracy of payments annually, and initiate program improvements to\
  \ ensure payment integrity. On November 20, 2009, Executive Order 13520, Reducing\
  \ Improper Payments and Eliminating Waste in Federal Programs, was issued for the\
  \ purpose of intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and\
  \ abuse in the major programs administered by the Federal government, while continuing\
  \ to ensure that the right people receive the right payment for the right reason\
  \ at the right time. The supporting website, https://paymentaccuracy.gov/, contains\
  \ the following information:\n\n•\tCurrent and historical rates and amounts of improper\
  \ payments for Federal agencies;\n•\tWhy improper payments occur; and\n•\tWhat agencies\
  \ are doing to reduce and recover improper payments.\nProgram Review\nThe STB has\
  \ only one program for budget purposes. The FY 2024 appropriated funding for the\
  \ program is $47.452 million. All the agency’s transactions are either employee\
  \ payroll and benefits, intra-governmental, or non-Federal transactions.\n\nThe\
  \ STB does not maintain its own financial management system but uses a shared service\
  \ provider, ESC, to process all accounting transactions and the DOI processes payroll\
  \ and benefits. ESC is subject to external audit in accordance with the Standards\
  \ for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and\
  \ Recodification. The STB examines the SSAE No. 18 audit results annually to determine\
  \ if the shared service provider’s internal controls are operating effectively.\
  \ The Board also evaluates the internal controls required to supplement the shared\
  \ service provider’s controls as outlined in the SSAE 18.\n\nIntra-governmental\
  \ transactions, accounts payables, and payments to agency employees are reviewed\
  \ as part of the agency’s internal control program under OMB Circular A-123, Appendix\
  \ A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Appendix C, Requirements for\
  \ Payment Integrity Improvement.\n\nBased on OMB Circular A-123, the STB’s program\
  \ was reviewed to identify those activities that were susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments. For FY 2024, the STB Federal and non-Federal payment was $16\
  \ million, and payroll was $28.1 million for a combined total of\n \n$44.1 million.\
  \ The Payment Integrity Information Act defines “significant” as either (1) improper\
  \ payments that exceed both $10 million and 1.5% of program disbursements; or (2)\
  \ improper payments in excess of $100 million. Significant improper payments in\
  \ the STB’s program needed to exceed both $0.6 million (1.5% improper payment rate)\
  \ and $10 million of all non-Federal payments and payments to Federal employees.\
  \ No material improper payments were identified by the STB in FY 2024 for significant\
  \ improper payment reporting.\nIn addition, the following risk factors, likely to\
  \ contribute to improper payments, were applied to the STB’s appropriated funds.\n\
  1.\tAny new programs or activity in the agency.\n2.\tComplexity of the activity\
  \ with respect to correct payments amounts.\n3.\tVolume of payments made annually.\n\
  4.\tRecent major changes in activity funding, authority, practice, or procedures.\n\
  5.\tLevel, experience, and quality of training for personnel responsible for certifying\
  \ that payments are accurate.\n6.\tInherent risks of improper payments due to the\
  \ nature of agency operations.\n7.\tSignificant deficiencies in the audit reports\
  \ of the agency that included Inspector General audit findings or external financial\
  \ audit findings.\n8.\tResults from prior improper payment work.\n\nIn FY 2024,\
  \ zero (-) improper payments were discovered. The STB will continue evaluating its\
  \ programs based on identified risk factors to prevent improper payments from occurring,\
  \ but the overall risk is low/not significant.\n\nImproper Payments Strategy\nThe\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act requires agencies to conduct payment recapture\
  \ audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency with expenditures\
  \ of $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.\
  \ The STB addresses proper management of payments by:\n•\tpreventing payment errors\
  \ through documented processes and internal controls;\n•\tdetecting overpayment\
  \ and underpayments through control testing.\nDue to the STB’s limited staffing\
  \ levels for its accounting and financial reporting functions, such support services\
  \ are provided under contract with ESC. Coordinating with ESC has greatly enhanced\
  \ the STB's capabilities for identification of improper payments using detailed\
  \ internal controls at both the STB and ESC. The STB obtains contracting support\
  \ from DOT, which follows established pre-enrollment, pre-award, and pre-payment\
  \ processes for all acquisition awards. Pre-enrollment procedures include cross\
  \ referencing applicants against the GSA System for Award Management (SAM) exclusion\
  \ records. ESC reviews Federal and commercial databases to verify past performance,\
  \ Federal government debt, integrity, and business ethics. For prepayment processes,\
  \ ESC verifies an entity against both SAM and the\n \nInternal Revenue Service’s\
  \ Taxpayer Identification Number Match Program before establishing the entity as\
  \ a vendor in its core financial accounting system.\nRecapture of Improper Payments\
  \ Reporting\nThe Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 requires agencies to\
  \ conduct recovery audits with respect to each program and activity of the agency\
  \ that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits would be cost-effective.\n\
  Once the STB has identified an improper payment with a non-Federal vendor, it is\
  \ STB’s policy to aggressively correct the improper payment. Upon research and analysis\
  \ of supporting documentation, the vendor is contacted for resolution (in the case\
  \ of underpayment to the agency). If the contract is ongoing, the Board will offset\
  \ the amount to be recovered on the next billing. For all other contracts, the vendor\
  \ is contacted, and a receivable is established for collection. If the vendor does\
  \ not provide payment, the debt is entered into the Treasury Offset Program. If\
  \ an improper payment is identified as an overpayment to the STB, the vendor is\
  \ promptly paid.\nThe table below shows the result of improper payments (in millions\
  \ of dollars) identified during FY 2024.\n\n\nReason for Improper Payment\t\nOverpayment\t\
