- Program_Name: Universal Service Fund - High Cost Legacy
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The main financial barrier for inadequate documentation related to assets
      stems from the carrier’s lack of maintaining adequate documentation to confirm
      assets were reported accurately.  An auditor can not confirm if the payment
      is accurate when documentation is not available to review.
    Info: High Cost carriers must file FCC Form 481 report with USAC on an annual
      basis. This form collects financial and operations information used to validate
      carrier support. This form collects financial and operations information used
      to validate carrier support and fulfills the annual 54.313 certification requirement.
    Theme: Financial
- Program_Name: Universal Service Fund - Lifeline
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The financial barriers prohibiting prevention of improper payments include
      compliance issues related to opt-out states.   Compliance issues include, but
      not limited to non-usage.
    Info: 'The Lifeline program participating providers did not maintain adequate

      documentation to support eligibility.  The lack of adequate documentation to
      confirm participation in qualifying programs could result in funding to ineligible  subscribers.'
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: The barrier stems from the inability of other agencies to expend resources
      towards a computer matching agreement.  Additional resources needed include
      legal and technical expertise.
    Info: The eligibility process leverages computer matching agreements with state
      and federal qualifying benefit programs, which minimizes manual eligibility
      review.  Implementing more computer matching agreements will further mitigate
      improper payments.
    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources
- Program_Name: Universal Service Fund - Schools and Libraries
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The financial barriers for competitive bidding include: invalid contract,
      lack of documentation, failure to use price as the primary factor, and failure
      to wait the mandatory minimum 28 day period prior to selecting a service provider(s).  Each
      financial barrier could lead to an improper payment.'
    Info: Schools and Libraries program applicants must conduct fair and open competitive
      bidding processes and select the most cost-effective equipment and services
      using the price of the eligible equipment and services as the primary factor.
      Schools and Libraries program participants must also retain documentation demonstrating
      compliance with the program rules for at least 10 years after the end of the
      funding year or last date of service delivery, whichever is later.

detail_CAP5: "The FCC had two program that were not compliant for the most recent\
  \ reporting period.  Those programs were the USF-Lifeline program which is in phase\
  \ 2 since it does not meet the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million in outlays.\
  \  The other program that was not in compliance in the Affordable Connectivity program\
  \ (ACP) which is currently in phase 1 reporting requirements.  \nUSF-Lifeline -\
  \ The Commission did not concur with the non-compliance finding for the Lifeline\
  \ program. The auditors’ recognized that no further action is required going forward.\
  \ However, we respectfully disagreed with the reasoning and conclusions that were\
  \ reached. The auditors based their finding on dated inputs (namely, an initial\
  \ response that gave a preliminary estimate done by our Administrator of what might\
  \ be a “potential” overpayment). In addition, the auditors appeared to consistently\
  \ disregarded subsequent written responses by the agency itself indicating that\
  \ the Commission had determined that the “potential” overpayment estimate the auditors\
  \ were relying on was vastly overstated. The consequence of the auditor’s approach\
  \ was to require the agency to report a substantial amount as improper which the\
  \ agency had repeatedly determined (as a regulatory matter) was not in fact improper,\
  \ undermining the accuracy of improper payment reporting.\nAs the FCC previously\
  \ explained at length, this matter involved an unusual regulatory wrinkle. The Commission\
  \ had been considering a pending request from an eligible telecommunications carrier\
  \ (ETC) for a correction to the appendix to the June 13, 2012 order granting it\
  \ an ETC designation. The consideration of that request was an exercise of the Commission’s\
  \ regulatory authority, and a decision on the application had to be made before\
  \ a determination was made regarding whether any payments were improper. The basic\
  \ substance of that decision was made in 2020—namely that the particular circumstances\
  \ justified a nunc pro tunc grant of authorization that would substantially reduce\
  \ or eliminate any overpayment—and was communicated to the auditors. Ultimately,\
  \ on May 7, 2024, the agency issued an order granting the request nunc pro tunc\
  \ to June 13, 2012, the date of the original grant. The effect of the order corrected\
  \ the clerical filing error made by the ETC and was retroactive to the date the\
  \ original order and was issued. Moreover, because the order was effective to the\
  \ date of the original June 2012 order, the ETC provision of service in the relevant\
  \ areas has giving rise to the audit finding was authorized. Thus there were no\
  \ improper payments and there was never a need to report such. Per the auditors,\
  \ on May 7, 2024, the FCC issued two Orders and a related Consent Decree regarding\
  \ this matter. The Orders and Consent Decree had the effect of retroactively expanding\
  \ the ETC’s jurisdiction to the full area for which they had been operating. Therefore,\
  \ the Orders had the effect of retroactively making the balance of payments valid.\n\
  ACP - The FCC underreported improper payment amounts of $6 million in its FY23 data\
  \ that was published on paymentaccuracy.gov. The recommendation by the auditors\
  \ was to develop and implement policies and procedures to identify, quantify, and\
  \ report any downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from provider\
  \ non-compliant conduct on paymentaccuracy.gov. Corrective actions will include:\
  \ 1) Every month, our Administrator will compile and report to the Office of the\
  \ Managing Director all ACP and EBB downward revisions received the prior month\
  \ that fall outside of the administrative filing window and 2) Develop an ACP procedure\
  \ to identify and report downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting\
  \ from non-compliant conduct.\n"
detail_agy1: The FCC will conduct risk assessments in two of its phase 1 programs
  next year and in FY26, the Commission will perform risk assessments on the remaining
  programs that are in phase 1 in accordance with the 3 year cycle plan.  However,
  the FCC will perform an off year risk assessment if conditions warrant such action.

  performance plan will be modified to include measures related to strengthening program
  integrity and ensuring compliance with improper payment related laws and guidance.  Over
  the last several years the FCC has made numerous improvements in its programs to
  reduce improper payments.  This is reflected in the number of phase 2 programs the
  FCC has at this time.  A couple of years ago the FCC had four programs in phase
  2 but next year we will only have two.

detail_dpa5: We use Do Not Pay (DNP) for onboarding new programs and new vendors.  This
  process has attributed to the reduction in improper payments.  We do not DNP to
  determine awards.  We have used DNP to hold off on making an award if the vendor
  was not active in SAM (this is one of the flags on the DNP portal that would have
  a vendor appear on the report we receive when we bump our vendors list up against
  the DNP portal).
detail_exs1: "In accordance with the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA) of 2002,\
  \ as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010,\
  \ Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) of 2012, and\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) of 2019, the Commission has made\
  \ significant efforts to implement policies and procedures to strengthen internal\
  \ controls that prevent improper payments.  In addition, the Commission utilizes\
  \ a payment recapture program that includes both audits and transaction testing\
  \ to search for and recapture overpayments.  Although the Commission has made strides\
  \ to improve policies, procedures and controls over improper payments, there is\
  \ still more work to be done.\nIn FY2023, the Commission had four programs that\
  \ were in phase 2 reporting which included: (Universal Service Fund (USF-High Cost\
  \ Legacy), (USF-Lifeline), (USF-Schools and Libraries) and the Telecommunications\
  \ Relay Service (TRS).  As of FY2024, the Commission now has only two programs that\
  \ meet the phase 2 reporting criteria. Those programs are the USF-High Cost Legacy\
  \ program and the USF-Lifeline program.  \nUSF-High Cost legacy – The High Cost\
  \ Legacy fund is the most complex program.  The improper payment increased slightly\
  \ from 2.87% to 4.46% do mainly to carriers having inadequate documentation for\
  \ their assets, the incorrect depreciation method being used and the lack of documentation.\
  \  In FY21, the Commission split the high cost program into two distinct programs\
  \ based on the guidance from our OIG and OMB (high cost modernized and high cost\
  \ legacy).  The High Cost Legacy program continues to be subject to significant\
  \ risks at this time.  The Commission and our Administrator, the Universal Service\
  \ Administrative Company (USAC), continues to focus their efforts on program integrity\
  \ assurance activities such as collaborating with their Audit and Assurance Division\
  \ partners to provide the annual circle of life webinars, meeting with the National\
  \ Exchange Carrier Association and the continuation of existing analysis and data\
  \ validations for the High Cost Legacy fund.  The high cost program has introduced\
  \ a new compliance layer by developing additional program integrity assurance (PIA)\
  \ procedures leveraging enhanced analytics and testing capabilities on a sample\
  \ basis to identify potential violations.      \nUSF-Lifeline – The USF-Lifeline\
  \ program has shown significant progress over the years, although this year the\
  \ program’s improper payment rate increased from 2.18% to 5.98%.  The main causes\
  \ for the increase include subscriber eligibility documentation loss in the National\
  \ Lifeline Accountability Database (NLAD) due to a documentation loss incident,\
  \ suspicious eligibility documentation and eligibility of participants accepted\
  \ by a National Verifier opt-out state due to the use of old or outdated benefit\
  \ identification cards (BIC).  The Lifeline program management continues to review\
  \ the root cause of the errors identified in the assessments and continues to perform\
  \ updates to training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation\
  \ and provide individual coaching for reviewers.  Since the program quality assurance\
  \ (PQA) review period, USAC has increased quality assurance (QA) volumes to achieve\
  \ a statistically valid, random sample for each eligibility program (Medicaid, SNAP,\
  \ etc.) each month.  This allows USAC to see trends by program and target training/coaching\
  \ more effectively.  USAC also just implemented a mandatory, semi-annual training\
  \ for all manual review agents which will be a refresher training with focus on\
  \ any concerning trends coming out of QA analysis.\nUSF-Schools and Libraries –\
  \ The USF-Schools and Libraries program has reported an improper payment rate below\
  \ the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million for the first time since inception.\
  \  This year’s improper payment rate was 1.27% which is down from the previous year\
  \ of 1.59%.  Although USAC and the Commission have made great strides in this program,\
  \ there is still more work that can be done to keep the improper payment rate below\
  \ the statutory thresholds.  The top two findings this year relate to competitive\
  \ bidding of contracts and internal connection violations.  As corrective actions,\
  \ the Schools and Libraries program continues the use of data analytics to identify\
  \ potential competitive bidding violations and leverages the analytics to improve\
  \ competitive bidding training and enhanced compliance through the addition of related\
  \ web and training content.  The Schools and Libraries program continues to expand\
  \ invoice pre-payment reviews to confirm internal connections are installed and\
  \ operating.\nTelecommunications Relay Service (TRS) – The TRS program continues\
  \ to be below the statutory limits and is currently in phase 1 reporting criteria.\n\
  The Commission and its components continue to make great strides when it comes to\
  \ oversight, internal control updates and implementation of policies and procedures.\
  \  Our ultimate goal is to bring all of our programs back to phase 1 reporting requirements\
  \ although there is more work to be done in order to reach the goal.  With the Commission\
  \ leadership, we continue to make much needed improvements in all of our programs\
  \ each year.  The Commission takes seriously the recommendations provided by our\
  \ OIG and its auditor so that our programs are in compliance with the guidance outlined\
  \ in OMB M-21-19. \n"
