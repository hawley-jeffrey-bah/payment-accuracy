detail_ara2_3: "The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit\
  \ program for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination,\
  \ the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted\
  \ over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and\
  \ overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments\
  \ to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.\
  \ \nThe Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor\
  \ payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The\
  \ Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments\
  \ since it began its analysis.  \nIn addition to contract payments, recapture auditing\
  \ may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers,\
  \ if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more\
  \ than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending\
  \ on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well\
  \ as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the\
  \ actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture\
  \ audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective\
  \ due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for\
  \ the program. As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s\
  \ Claims Review Staff limits the likelihood that the whistleblower award program\
  \ would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture\
  \ audits would be beneficial.\nThe Commission will continue to monitor the potential\
  \ for improper payments across all programs and activities it administers and assess\
  \ whether implementing payment recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.\n"

detail_dpa5: The Commission’s shared services provider utilizes the DNP Business Center,
  on the Commission’s behalf, to perform online searches and screen payments against
  the DNP databases to augment data analytics capabilities.  Based on the results
  of the reviews to date, the DNP initiative has not identified any improper payments.
detail_exs1: "The Commission does not administer grant, benefit or loan programs.\
  \ For FY 2022, CFTC’s most significant payments were for monetary awards to eligible\
  \ whistleblowers who voluntarily provided the CFTC with original information about\
  \ violations of the CEA that led the CFTC to bring enforcement actions that resulted\
  \ in monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million. CFTC’s other most significant payments\
  \ in FY 2022 were for payroll and benefits for its employees, which are administered\
  \ by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) and the\
  \ OPM, and payments to vendors for goods and services used during the course of\
  \ normal operations. \nSignificant erroneous payments are defined as annual erroneous\
  \ payments in the program exceeding both $10 million and 1.5 percent, or $100 million\
  \ of total annual program payments. Although the Commission disbursed $203.3 million\
  \ in whistleblower payments during FY 2022, the review of each individual award\
  \ by the Commission’s Claims Review Staff limits the likelihood that the whistleblower\
  \ award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments.  In addition,\
  \ based on the results of transaction testing applied to a sample of FY 2022 vendor\
  \ payments, consideration of risk factors, and reliance on the internal controls\
  \ in place over the payment and disbursement processes, the Commission has determined\
  \ that none of its programs and activities carried out in the normal course of business\
  \ are susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels\
  \ set by OMB. \nIn accordance with Appendix C of Circular A-123, the Commission\
  \ is not required to determine a statistically valid estimate of erroneous payments\
  \ or develop a corrective action plan if the program is not susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments.\n"
