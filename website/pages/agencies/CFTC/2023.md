detail_ara2_3: 'The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit
  program for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination,
  the Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted
  over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and
  overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments
  to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.


  The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor
  payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The
  Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments
  since it began its analysis. In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing
  may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers, if
  determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more than
  $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending on
  the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well as
  the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the actions.
  However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture audit
  program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective due to
  the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for the program.


  As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims Review
  Staff and multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that the whistleblower award
  program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment recapture
  audits would be beneficial.


  The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across
  all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment
  recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.'

detail_dpa5: The Commission’s shared services provider utilizes the DNP Business Center,
  on the Commission’s behalf, to perform online searches and screen payments against
  the DNP databases to augment data analytics capabilities. Based on the results of
  the reviews to date, the DNP initiative has not identified any improper payments.
detail_exs1: 'The Commission does not administer grant, benefit or loan programs.
  For FY 2023, CFTC’s most significant payments were for payroll and benefits for
  its employees, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National
  Finance Center (NFC) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and payments
  to vendors for goods and services used during the course of normal operations. CFTC’s
  other most significant  payments are for monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers
  who voluntarily provided the CFTC with original information about violations of
  the CEA that led the CFTC to bring enforcement actions that resulted in monetary
  sanctions exceeding $1 million.  However, in FY 2023, CFTC disbursed only $670,000
  to a handful of whistleblowers. Even in years when CFTC disburses millions of dollars
  in whistleblower payments, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s
  Claims Review Staff as well as multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that
  the whistleblower award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments.


  Significant erroneous payments are defined as annual erroneous payments in the program
  exceeding both $10 million and 1.5 percent, or $100 million of total annual program
  payments.  Based on the results of transaction testing applied to a sample of FY
  2023 vendor payments, consideration of risk factors, and reliance on the internal
  controls in place over the payment and disbursement processes, the Commission has
  determined that none of its programs and activities carried out in the normal course
  of business are susceptible to significant improper payments at or above the threshold
  levels set by OMB.


  In accordance with Appendix C of Circular A-123, the Commission is not required
  to determine a statistically valid estimate of erroneous payments or develop a corrective
  action plan if the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments.'
