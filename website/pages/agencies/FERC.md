detail_ara2_3: Due to FERC's low improper payment rate and high recapture rate, we
  have determined that it is not cost-effective to employ traditional Payment Recapture
  Audit Contracts or to purchase sophisticated software; however, we do conduct site
  specific activities that meet the OMB definition of a Payment Recapture Audit -
  "a review and analysis of an agency's or program's accounting and financial records,
  supporting documentation, and other pertinent information supporting its payments,
  that is specifically designed to identify overpayments. It is not an audit in the
  traditional sense. Rather, it is a detective and corrective control activity designed
  to identify and recapture overpayments, and as such, is a management function and
  responsibility."
detail_ara2_3_2: FERC conducts an SES performance metrics review, along with an internal
  controls OMB Circular A-123 test work review to evaluate if any further controls
  are needed to further eliminate the possibility of an Improper payment being issued.  FERC
  has historically concluded that the less than 1% of disbursement activity that is
  deemed as Improper does not warrant nor justify the need to conduct recovery AUDITS.

detail_arp18: Historically, FERC has identified that less than 1% of all disbursement
  activities that would qualify as an Improper payment to thereafter be recovered
  by the agency.  Typically, Improper payments identified at FERC are the result of
  changes to an individual/vendor banking information.

detail_dpa5: Given that FERC Improper Payment results have been historically less
  than 1% on an annual basis, FERC does not utilize Treasury's Do Not Pay platform.  FERC
  internal controls over all disbursement activities have provided reasonable assurance
  that all payments are appropriately reviewed before issuance to the vendor/individual.
detail_exs1: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) conducts an annual review
  of all disbursement activities to measure results against all applicable Prompt
  Payment laws and payment integrity guidance.

detail_pcp14: There were no specific recommendations for FERC as our payment integrity
