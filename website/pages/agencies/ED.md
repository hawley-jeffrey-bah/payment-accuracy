  Themes:
  - Barriers: There are no barriers prohibiting improving prevention of Improper Payments
      for this program. These Improper Payments were largely due to rounding errors.
      The small amounts identified relative to the program outlays would not usually
      present an opportunity to efficiently use resources to attempt to recover.
    Info: There are no specific Financial Eligibility criteria that was not met for
      these improper payments. The Department identified a number of payments with
      small rounding errors. The small amounts identified relative to the program
      outlays would not usually present an opportunity to efficiently use resources
      to attempt to recover.

- Program_Name: Federal Pell Grant Program
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The Pell Grant program structure per the Higher Education Act of 1965
      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). FSA must
      continue to rely on controls established by external entities that receive funds
      and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including the Pell Grant program.
      These entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will continue to
      leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance audits to
      identify and address root causes of improper payments made by external entities.


      FSA has the internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other
      infrastructure to reduce improper payments that are within FSA’s control. FSA
      has established an integrated system of complementary oversight functions to
      help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance by all
      participating institutions.

    Info: 'Education eligibility requirements for federal student aid include:

      - enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible degree
      or certificate program;

      - maintain satisfactory academic progress in college or career school;

      - demonstrate qualification to obtain a college or career school education;

      - status as a full-time or part-time student, and

      - plans to attend school for a full academic year or less.


      The Education eligibility criteria listed above must be met for payments to
      be considered proper.

  - Barriers: 'FSA maintains a robust internal control framework which includes performing
      computer matches performed in FSA systems against external sources during the
      aid delivery process which prevent financial eligibility root cause-related
      improper payments.


      Historically, FSA has had to rely on the applicant to post their income data
      on the FAFSA or to import themselves from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
      using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. A significant percentage of Pell improper
      payments result from the applicant misreporting their income. In December 2019,
      Congress passed the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
      Education Act (FUTURE Act), which amends Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue
      Code (IRC) to allow the IRS to disclose certain federal tax information (FTI)
      to FSA. In FY24, FSA implemented the authorities and provisions provided in
      the FUTURE Act and FAFSA Simplification Act to streamline and strengthen the
      collection of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance.
      Specifically, FSA implemented the FAFSA Processing System (FPS) and Federal
      Tax Information (FTI) systems to automatically provide a student and families’
      federal tax information to FSA for the 2024–25 FAFSA form. This significantly
      improves data authentication by enabling FSA to automatically receive certain
      FTI from the IRS through a direct-data exchange with applicant approval.

      '
    Info: 'Financial eligibility requirements for federal student aid include but
      are not limited to:

      - demonstrate financial need;

      - sign the certification statement on the Free Application for Federal Student
      Aid (FAFSA) form stating that you are not in default on a federal student loan,
      you do not owe money on a federal student grant, and you will use federal student
      aid only for educational purposes;

      - Income/Expected Family Contribution; and

      - the cost of attendance (determined by your school).

detail_ara2_3: 'The Department has determined that payment recapture audits would
  not be cost effective for any of its loan and grant programs or for contracts. The
  Department identifies and recovers improper payments through sources other than
  payment recapture audits and works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants
  to resolve and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and
  the Department conducted program reviews. The Department also analyzes the return
  of grant funds from recipients to determine if they are due to improper payments.
  When an improper payment is detected and deemed collectable, the Department establishes
  an account receivable and pursues collection. Recoveries are also made through grant
  program, payroll, and other offsets. Recipients of Department funds can appeal management’s
  decisions regarding funds to be returned to the Department or they may go bankrupt
  before the Department can collect, thereby delaying or decreasing the amounts the
  Department is able to collect.


  Additionally, the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect improper
  payments from grantees in cases where it determines that pursuing collections would
  cause more harm to the federal interest. For these and other reasons, not all identified
  improper payments will ultimately be collected and collections will not necessarily
  be made in the same year the improper payments were identified.'

detail_exs1: "Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William\
  \ D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per\
  \ OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments\
  \ (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2024 are related to misreported income, credit\
  \ balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal\
  \ deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior\
  \ year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate\
  \ and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, through the\
  \ Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility (SABER) Initiative, FSA has implemented the\
  \ Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act\
  \ and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act for the\
  \ 2024-2025 FAFSA which streamlines and strengthens the collection of data used\
  \ to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. IPs and UPs that are\
  \ outside of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that\
  \ are responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to\
  \ provide training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual\
  \ Conference, and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet\
  \ FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and\
  \ administrative capability.  \n\nThe FY 2024 IP and UP rate for the Pell program\
  \ is 2.64% down from 2.83% in FY 2023. The decrease in the FY 2024 Pell estimate\
  \ from the FY 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in IPs as derived from compliance\
  \ audit data. The FY2024 IP and UP rate for the Direct Loan program is 0.94%, up\
  \ from 0.70% in FY 2023.  The increase in the FY 2024 Direct Loan estimate from\
  \ FY 2023 is primarily due to an increase in IPs as derived from compliance audit\
  \ data.  \n\nThe Department also estimated the FY 2024 IP and UP rates for one non-FSA\
  \ Phase 2 program: Education Stabilization Fund (ESF). The FY 2024 IP and UP rate\
  \ for the ESF program is 0.00015%. The ESF program experienced overpayments that\
  \ were beyond the agency’s control, due to automatic rounding errors. These discrepancies\
  \ occurred both within Excel and other system-based processes. Preventing rounding\
  \ within system-based processes is inherently challenging. When rounding occurs\
  \ in a system and is subsequently recalculated in Excel, discrepancies can arise,\
  \ resulting in minor differences in amounts. Consequently, it is difficult for states\
  \ to prevent these rounding errors, which is why they are classified as beyond the\
  \ agency’s control.  \n\nIn FY 2023, the Department implemented measures to reduce\
  \ unknown payments, the predominant reason for the Title I, Part A, Grants to Local\
  \ Educational Agencies program’s high improper payment estimate reported in FY22.\
  \ The Department worked with state educational agencies (SEAs) to produce sufficient\
  \ documentation for any advanced payments. Additionally, there were no unknown payments\
  \ reported for FY23 for the Special Education Grants to States program. With the\
  \ Department’s OIG’s determination of FY23 compliance with the Payment Integrity\
  \ Information Act (PIIA), both of these programs moved from Phase 2 (estimation)\
  \ to Phase 1 (risk assessment).  \n\nThe Department continues its efforts to collect\
  \ confirmed IPs. Although the Department has determined that payment recapture audits\
  \ would not be cost effective for any of its programs and activities, the Department\
  \ identifies and recovers IPs through other recovery mechanisms. The Department\
  \ works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants to resolve and recover\
  \ amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and program reviews. Additionally,\
  \ the Department analyzes the return of grant funds from recipients to determine\
  \ if they are due to IPs. When an IP is confirmed and deemed collectable, the Department\
  \ establishes an account receivable and pursues collection. Additionally, the Department\
  \ has wide discretion to decide not to collect IPs from grantees in cases where\
  \ it determines that pursuing collections would cause more harm to the federal interest.\
  \ \n\nFinally, by performing improper payment risk assessments, the Department has\
  \ not identified any new programs as high risk requiring an estimate. The Department\
  \ continues to maintain PIIA compliance by emphasizing prevention of improper payments.\
  \ Excessive drawdowns can reveal grantee cash management issues, an area where the\
  \ Department’s grants management community continues to address through its technical\
  \ assistance to grantees."
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: "The OIG recommends that the Department develop sampling and estimation\
  \ plans for the Pell and Direct Loan programs that will produce reliable estimates.\
  \ Specifically, the plan should (a) produce appropriate and accurate confidence\
  \ intervals around a statistically valid point estimate; (b) consistent with 31\
  \ U.S.C. section 3352(c)(1)(A), produce an estimate that is otherwise appropriate\
  \ using a methodology approved by the Director of OMB; or (c) consistent with OMB\
  \ Circular A-123 Appendix C, Part II, B(2), include a detailed explanation as to\
  \ why it is not possible to produce a statistically-valid point estimate and appropriate\
  \ and accurate confidence intervals around the estimate. \n\nThe OIG also recommended\
  \ that the Department develop and implement procedures to ensure that the sampling\
  \ populations of drawdowns are complete for the basis of calculating the improper\
  \ payment and unknown payment estimates for the ESF program. Additionally, for programs\
  \ that require them, design, and implement improper payment and unknown payment\
  \ sampling and estimation plans that are appropriate for the sampling of payments\
  \ based on accurate sampling populations and result in reliable estimates. Per the\
  \ OIG, the improper payment and unknown payment sampling and estimation plans should\
  \ also include language stating why sampling populations in Stage 1 may not match\
  \ sampling population in Stage 2 and explain the statistical impact on the estimates.\
  \ Additionally, the OIG recommended the implementation of a quality assurance checklist\
  \ to ensure the proper details from the drawdown population are accurately included\
  \ on the extrapolation sheet."
