detail_ara2_3: Due to the Department's low improper payment rate of 0.16% and high
  recapture rate of 89.80%, the determination was made that it is not cost-effective
  to conduct recovery audits. DOE does conduct recovery activities including but not
  limited to single audits, post payment reviews, and contract close-out reviews.

detail_dpa5: 'Using Do Not Pay (DNP) allows DOE to halt payments immediately if there
  are any circumstances that would require us to confirm with the contracting officer,
  while providing

  an early alert to the procurement office to halt any future obligations to that
  vendor. DOE also deactivates vendor records that have exclusion matches for which
  all POs are closed and notes that the vendor has an active exclusion alerts the
  DOE team to check to ensure the vendor no longer has an active exclusion before
  reactivating the record. This ensures that no new awards were made to vendors that
  have an active exclusion. DOE also sends a daily file to DNP for Batch Matching
  to ensure that there are no missed data source matches in the Continuous Monitoring
  process due to timing issues.'
detail_exs1: 'DOE conducts risk assessments on a three-year cycle for all programs
  with outlays over $10M. FY 2022 is an off-cycle year; however, DOE requires its
  payment sites to confirm whether or not they need to conduct a risk assessment based
  on a significant increase in funding, change in legislation, changes to payment
  processes that would make the site susceptible to significant improper payments,
  and impact from natural disasters, national emergencies, or changes to the organizational
  structure that increases payment integrity risk.


  Although FY 2022 is an off-cycle year for risk assessments, 20 (43%) of DOE’s 46
  payment sites conducted assessments. Risk assessments were conducted for the Department’s
  Vendors/Contracts, Payroll, Financial Assistance Awards, and Other programs resulting
  in a Low-risk rating for these programs and DOE.'
