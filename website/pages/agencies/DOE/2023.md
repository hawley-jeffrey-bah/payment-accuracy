    outlays (10% or more compared to the last FY); 3) changes to the site’s payment
    processes that would make the site susceptible to significant improper payments;
    or 4) impact from natural disasters, national emergencies, or a change to site
    structure that increases the payment integrity risk.'

detail_agy1: The Department is unique to the federal government in that payments are
  processed across 47 payment sites, many operated by the integrated contractors at
  the 17 National laboratories, and 8 cleanup sites. This arrangement was first set
  up by Congress for the Manhattan Project during World War 2. The goal was to increase
  production speed and agility by reducing the bureaucracy inherent in the rules and
  regulations of the Federal Government. DOE has oversight responsibilities for these
  programs. Robust controls are mandated to detect and correct overpayments. Auditors
  audit; contracting officers provide final approval for contract compliance;  and
  financial management personnel review and analyze accounting and financial records,
  supporting documentation on an annual basis.

detail_ara2_3: Due to the Department's low improper payment rate of 0.09% and recapture
  rate of 89.25%, the determination was made that it is not cost-effective to conduct
  recovery audits. DOE conducts recovery activities including but not limited to prepayment
  review and approval of invoices; performing quarterly prompt-payment reviews, post-payment
  reviews, and contractor internal audits; leveraging the results of cost allowability
  audits of integrated contractors and interim and close-out reviews of contracts
  and grants, reviews of grant credits in the Automated Standard Application for Payments
  (ASAP), and results from travel audits.

detail_dpa5: 'DOE uses the Do Not Pay portal within the Treasury Working System to
  review payment eligibility for purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments
  and fraud.

  Where the system identifies exclusion matches for supplier records of POs with funding
  exhausted, DOE would close such records. A note is then added in the DBA name field
  that the vendor has an active exclusion. A request to reopen the supplier would
  alert the supplier team to perform mandatory validation checks before reopening.
  This ensures no new awards are granted to suppliers with active exclusions. DOE
  also send a daily file to DNP for Batch Matching to ensure that there are no missed
  data source matches in the Continuous Monitoring process that would result from
  any timing issues.

  DOE utilizes DNP as a proactive solution for reducing/preventing improper payments
  as opposed to being reactive. During FY 2022, there were 5 supplier records closed
  due to active SAM Exclusion matches in DNP. Closing of supplier records prevents
  procurement offices from entering into any new contracts with the vendors which
  could result in improper payments. Since DNP is a proactive solution to preventing
  improper payments, quantitative amount of the dollar or number of improper payments
  prevented by the use of DNP cannot be made; otherwise, the cost of tracking would
  outweigh the benefit.

  For FY 2022, there were 78,000 payments screened through Do Not Pay totaling $8.8
  billion.'
detail_exs1: "DOE’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent FY 2022\
  \ compliance audit for the reporting of FY 2021 payments. PIIA requires agencies\
  \ to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than\
  \ $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify\
  \ those susceptible to significant improper payments.\nDOE conducts risk assessments\
  \ on a three-year cycle for all programs with outlays over $10M. FY 2023 is an off-cycle\
  \ year; however, DOE requires its payment sites to confirm whether or not they need\
  \ to conduct a risk assessment based on a significant increase in funding, change\
  \ in legislation, changes to payment processes, and impact from natural disasters,\
  \ national emergencies, or changes to the organizational structure that increases\
  \ payment integrity risk.\nRisk assessments were conducted for five of the six payment\
  \ types resulting in a Low-risk rating for them under the DOE Payment Integrity\
  \ Program.\nDOE also conducts site-specific reviews and analysis of accounting and\
  \ financial records, supporting documentation, and other pertinent information supporting\
  \ payments.  These activities are detective and corrective in nature, and are designed\
  \ to identify and recapture overpayments.  \nFinally, DOE will continue to scrutinize\
  \ improper payment activity and controls through its internal control program by\
  \ emphasizing, evaluating, and strengthening controls as needed to maintain the\
  \ Department’s record of low payment errors and to continue the effective stewardship\
  \ of public funds.  \n"

detail_pcp14: 'The OIG provided the following recommended actions to further improve
  prevention and reduction of improper payments and unknown payments in the most recent
  PIIA compliance Report: (1) "Update annual guidance to sites to include more specific
  direction on payment reporting sites’ collection of useful and consistent data to
  identify detailed root causes of reported improper payments and on developing plans
  to mitigate them in the future; and (2) Expand the use of data analytics at both
  Department Headquarters and payment reporting sites to better identify potential
  improper payments and the root causes for improper payments, especially as expenditures
  will increase due to IIJA, IRA, and the CHIPS Act."'
