detail_ara2_3: USAGM does not perform recovery audits due to programs not being susceptible
  to improper payments and USAGM's payment composition of large volume, low dollar
  payments.  Our analysis showed that the manual labor cost required to identify and
  recover an improper payment generally outweighs the amount that can be recovered.

  data against the Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File (DMF), American
  InfoSource (AIS) Obituary and Probate, Department of Defense, and Department of
  State data sources during Payment Integration (or at the time of payment).  All
  funds disbursed by the Department of Treasury go through Payment Integration, in
  which the DNP portal automatically matches all PAM files against available death
  sources.  Additionally, USAGM loads the SAM file into the Momentum accounting system
  daily.  Any issues are identified when the file is loaded and resolved prior to
  payments processed.
detail_exs1: "USAGM's Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance\
  \ audit.   PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities\
  \ with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least\
  \ once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.\
  \ Annually, USAGM conducts improper payment risk assessments of all programs on\
  \ a three-year rotational schedule.  In FY 2023, USAGM conducted improper payment\
  \ risk assessments for 4 programs and determined they were not susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments.  In addition, risk assessments evaluating programs that experience\
  \ any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will\
  \ be done to determine if the agency continues to be at low risk for making significant\
  \ improper payments at or above the  threshold levels set by PIIA. Finally, USAGM\
  \ maintains payment integrity through strong pre-payment controls and continuous\
  \ monitoring.  \nUSAGM's recovery rate in FY 2023  was significantly higher due\
  \ to the recovery of a large overpayment made in the FY2022 reporting period."
