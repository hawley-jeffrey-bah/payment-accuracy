- Program_Name: Administration for Children and Families (ACF) - Child Care and Development
    Fund
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Barriers that prohibit HHS from improving prevention of Improper Payments
      in the Child Care and Development Fund program by matching data with Contractor
      or Provider Status eligibility themes vary from state to state.  The Child Care
      and Development Fund is a federally funded, state-administered block grant program
      and each state has maximum flexibility in developing the programs and policies
      that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.  Under
      the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have flexibility
      within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including subsidy payment rates,
      co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining
      eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  An example of a state reported
      barrier prohibiting improving improving prevention of improper payments with
      respect to eligibility criteria is staff turnover.   We are however, able to
      improve prevention of Improper Payments by providing technical assistance that
      targets the root causes of Improper Payments reported by the individual states.
    Info: The specific Contractor or Provider Status eligibility criteria for the
      Child Care and Development Fund program varies from state to state.  This is
      because under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states
      have maximum flexibility in developing the Child Care and Development Fund programs
      and policies that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.  Further,
      states have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including
      subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income
      thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  For
      example, there are federal eligibility requirements related to income, however,
      states have flexibility around how they verify income.  In some states, paystubs
      are required to verify income.

- Program_Name: Administration for Children and Families (ACF) - Head Start
  Themes:
  - Barriers: HHS has not identified any barriers prohibiting improving prevention
      of Improper Payments by matching data with Financial eligibility for the Head
      Start program.
    Info: HHS's specific Financial eligibility criteria for the Head Start program
      varies depending upon the nature of the expenditure.  In general, expenditures
      must be supported by sufficient documentation to evidence the purpose of the
      expenditure and that it was in line with the Head Start program's allowable
      uses of funds.
    Theme: Financial
- Program_Name: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - Advance Premium Tax
    Credit (APTC)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'The primary driver of improper payments is manual error associated
      with verifying consumer eligibility for APTC payments.  The manual verification
      of consumer eligibility involves the review of a large volume of unstructured
      information, and accordingly there is a heightened risk for error.

      '
    Info: The Federally-facilitated Exchange and associated contractors are responsible
      for processing health insurance applications in accordance with applicable regulatory
      requirements and the policies of the Exchange. Generally, APTC improper payments
      are unrelated to the access or availability of data, and instead relate to administrative
      or processing errors made by Exchange contractors in making eligibility determinations
      (that is, the cause of errors relates to contractor performance, and not the
      access or availability of information).
    Theme: Contractor of Provider Status
- Program_Name: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - Children's Health
    Insurance Program (CHIP)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: States are responsible for determining beneficiary eligibility and ensuring
      that claims are adjudicated properly. As such, the federal government has limited
      impact over the state's controls around determinations and claim adjudication.
    Info: States are responsible for determining beneficiary eligibility and ensuring
      that claims are adjudicated properly. States mainly have issues with enrolled
      providers not appropriately screened by the state; providers not enrolled; and/or
      providers without the required NPI on the claim; enrolling a beneficiary when
      ineligible for CHIP; determining a beneficiary to be eligible for the incorrect
      eligibility category, resulting in an ineligible service or incorrect federal
      reimbursement amount being provided; not conducting beneficiary redeterminations
      timely or at all; or not performing, completing, or providing sufficient documentation
      to support a required element of the eligibility determination process. As states
      are responsible for administration of claims processing and eligibility determinations,
      CMS does not have direct access to information systems that house this information.
      Within the guidance of OMB A-123 Appendix C and from the viewpoint of the federal
      agency, the state would reasonably be considered the contractor/provider in
      the structure of this program's administration.
    Theme: Contractor of Provider Status
  - Barriers: States and state based providers are responsible for ensuring that claims
      are adjudicated properly. As such, the federal government has limited impact
      over the state's controls around claim adjudication.
    Info: State and state based provider billing and diagnosis/drg coding errors,
      unbundling errors, unit errors, medically unnecessary services, or policy violations.

- Program_Name: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - Medicare Advantage
    (Part C)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Data matching requires all payment information to be in an electronic
      and electronically readable format.  While the risk adjustment data could be
      used for data matching, the data must be validated by source documentation which
      largely consists of medical records.  Those medical records are not submitted
      at the time of making payment determinations.
    Info: MAOs must prepare and submit to CMS the risk adjustment data necessary to
      calculate beneficiary risk factors for each payment year. Risk factors used
      in the payment calculation are based upon CMS Hierarchical Condition Categories
      (CMS-HCCs) that reflect the severity of beneficiary health conditions/ diagnoses.
      Beneficiary diagnosis data is extracted from the risk adjustment data submissions
      in the Encounter Data Processing System (EDPS) and Risk Adjustment Processing
      System (RAPS).  Improper Payments result from to the inability to validate beneficiary
      diagnoses that map to the CMS Hierarchical Condition Categories (CMS-HCCs) for
      a particular payment year model.

- Program_Name: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - Medicare Fee-for-Service
    (FFS)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The program does not have access to medical records and other documentation,
      and must rely on provider/supplier compliance to provide them. After multiple
      attempts to obtain documentation, these claims are categorized as improper payments.
      For example, the primary reason for hospital outpatient errors is missing provider
      documentation to support the order, or the intent to order for certain services.
    Info: These are claims with lacking or insufficient documentation to determine
      whether they are proper or improper due to provider/supplier non-compliance.  After
      multiple attempts to obtain documentation, these claims are categorized as improper
      payments. For example, the primary reason for hospital outpatient errors is
      missing provider documentation to support the order, or the intent to order
      for certain services.
    Theme: Contractor of Provider Status
  - Barriers: 'The program relies on provider/supplier compliance to follow regulations
      and guidance regarding medical necessity, coding, billing, and other payment
      policies. Provider failure to follow these payment policies results in improper
      payments.

      '
    Info: 'These are claims with sufficient documentation to determine that they were
      improper due to medical necessity errors, incorrect coding, or other reasons.
      These are monetary loss improper payments.

      '
    Theme: Medical Status
- Program_Name: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - Medicare Prescription
    Drug Benefit (Part D)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Part D payments are tied to detailed prescription information for individual
      drugs. The source document (Prescription) for drug claims are not audited against
      federal requirements at point-of-sale and are not submitted in an electronically
      readable format.
    Info: A Part D drug claim must be in accordance with regulatory guidance and be
      supported by a valid prescription that aligns to the payment data submitted
      for payment.

- Program_Name: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) - Provider Relief
    Fund General and Targeted
  Themes:
  - Barriers: There are no known financial eligibility related barriers prohibiting
      improving prevention of improper payments.
    Info: PRF recipients must only use payments for eligible expenses, including services
      rendered and lost revenues during the period of availability. Published payment
      methodologies detailed how HHS allocated PRF payments to providers who met required
      financial criteria in the published methodologies.

- Program_Name: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) – COVID-19 Claims
    Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities for Testing, Treatment,
    and Vaccine Administration for the Uninsured Program (UIP)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: "Risk of each claim reimbursed was based on the barrier of time and\
      \ volume, and the charge to distribute UIP reimbursements quickly. More robust\
      \ prevention efforts directed at avoiding overpayments were not adopted. \n\n\
      Due to a lack of sufficient funds, the UIP stopped accepting testing and treatment\
      \ claims on March 22, 2022, at 11:59 p.m. ET and on April 5, 2022, at 11:59\
      \ p.m. ET for vaccine administration claims. On June 3, 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility\
      \ Act (FRA) of 2023 was enacted. With the passage of FRA and the related rescission\
      \ of program funds, no additional claims will be reimbursed under the UIP."
    Info: Documentation was not retained to support why certain rates were used to
      calculate the reimbursed claim amounts rather than the rate in effect on the
      last date of service. Support was not retained to validate the rate used at
      time of claims processing.  Additionally, certain rates included add-on components
      and fee schedule update load applied to the claim reimbursements that should
      not have been applied.  Lastly, recalculated reimbursed amounts using set methodology
      did not result in the same amounts reimbursed to providers.

detail_agy1: HHS is committed to reducing improper and unknown payments across programs,
  enhancing services for recipients, and safeguarding taxpayer resources. The department
  implements innovative solutions that target the underlying causes of improper and
  unknown payments while ensuring beneficiary access to health and human services.
detail_ara1: 'Yes'
detail_ara2: 'Yes'
detail_ara2_1: 'The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified
  in recovery audits across various programs:


  Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments by
  issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the identified
  amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from future payments
  made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily submit a refund
  to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper payment.


  Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations,
  the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation
  audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy of
  diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS
  anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment
  Data Validation audits in FY 2024.


  Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an analysis
  of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare Part D coverage.
  Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors are notified
  of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation is
  provided.


  Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of Medicaid
  overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.


  Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments
  related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues
  a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt''s existence and including claim-specific
  information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt
  and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified
  timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if
  the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury
  for collection.


  These methods demonstrate a systematic approach to recovering improper payments
  in various healthcare programs, ensuring that funds are appropriately recovered
  while providing avenues for resolution and reconciliation where necessary.'
detail_ara2_2: null
detail_ara2_3: 'The decision not to conduct recovery audits in the Advance Payments
  of the Premium Tax Credit (APTC) program is justified based on several key factors.
  First, the requirement for consumers to reconcile APTC payments at the time of tax
  filing inherently mitigates the risk of overpayment. This means that any discrepancies
  or overpayments can be rectified during the annual tax return process, reducing
  the need for recovery audits to recoup funds.


  Second, the utilization of data matching programs with various Federal agencies
  during the eligibility determination process significantly enhances the accuracy
  and integrity of the application process. These data matching procedures ensure
  that the personal information provided by applicants aligns with known data, reducing
  the potential for fraud or abuse.


  Considering these factors, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has
  found that the combination of the reconciliation process and robust data matching
  practices effectively minimizes the risk of improper payments and fraud, making
  it unnecessary to allocate resources for recovery audits in the APTC program at
  this time. This decision is both fiscally responsible and practical, ensuring that
  resources are directed towards areas where they are needed most.


  The Administration for Children & Families (ACF) is a division of the Department
  of Health & Human Services.  ACF promotes the economic and social well-being of
  families, children, individuals, and communities.  ACF programs aim to empower families
  and individuals to increase their economic independence and productivity; encourage
  strong, healthy, supportive communities that have a positive impact on quality of
  life and the development of children; create partnerships with front-line service
  providers, states, localities and tribal communities to identify and implement solutions
  that transcend traditional program boundaries; improve access to services through
  planning, reform and integration; and address the needs, strengths and abilities
  of vulnerable populations including refugees and migrants.   Recovery of improper
  payments would potentially harm the communities served by ACF''s programs.  Also,
  for many of the programs recovering funds from states, organizations, and individuals
  that provide these services may reduce the ability to support the needs of vulnerable,
  underserved, and low-income beneficiaries of these services'

detail_arp17: 'Various conditions give rise to overpayments identified in recovery
  audits in different healthcare programs:


  Medicare FFS: Overpayments are often detected in Medicare Fee-For-Service when data
  analysis and medical record reviews reveal inaccuracies in billed and paid claims.
  These claims are selected for audit based on prior-year improper payment rate data,
  indicating discrepancies in billing and payment accuracy.


  Medicare Part D: Overpayments in Part D audits stem from a lack of documentation
  by plan sponsors when making payment determinations. To address this issue, CMS
  has taken steps to provide training to plan sponsors and share lessons learned from
  audits to promote best practices among plan sponsors.


  Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP): Overpayments occur when Medicare''s information
  about a beneficiary''s additional insurance coverage is missing, incomplete, or
  inaccurate, leading Medicare to mistakenly or conditionally pay for services as
  the primary payer. The Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor, operating
  as the Commercial Repayment Center, identifies and recovers these payments from
  the entity with primary payment responsibility. The MSP program aims to ensure that
  Medicare is aware of situations where it should not be the primary payer, and it
  follows Coordination of Benefits rules to determine the order of payment between
  Medicare and other insurers.


  In each of these scenarios, the conditions giving rise to overpayments are being
  addressed through audits, training, documentation improvements, and enhanced coordination
  efforts to prevent and rectify improper payments and discrepancies in the healthcare
  payment system. These measures contribute to the overall integrity of healthcare
  programs and the responsible use of public funds.'
detail_arp18: 'In Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS), overpayments are assessed by Medicare
  Administrative Contractors, and there are multiple ways to resolve them. HHS does
  not distinguish between overpayments pending collection and those deemed uncollectable
  due to the dynamic and case-specific nature of the process.  Lastly, the dollar
  amount of overpayments recovered through recovery audits this reporting period that
  were used to administer the recovery audits and activities program includes funding
  used to: administer the recovery audit program; pay recovery audit contractor contingency
  fees; correct identified underpayments to providers; or account for amounts in prior
  years but overturned on appeal in FY 2023.'

  \ Information Act of 2019 (PIIA).  For Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 (October 1, 2022 –\
  \ September 30, 2023), these activities included:\n\n1) Conducting 56 program-specific\
  \ improper payment risk assessments;\n2) Updating the improper payment risk assessment\
  \ questionnaire, the risk factor calculation, and Risk Assessment Portal; \n3) Developing\
  \ policies, procedures, and supporting tools to facilitate coverage of all programs\

  \ improper payment results to identify root causes and establish and refine corrective\
  \ actions. \n\nIn FY 2023, HHS reported improper and unknown payment estimates for\
  \ two new programs at risk for significant improper payments. Additionally, six\
  \ programs reduced their improper and unknown payment rates, while two programs\
  \ saw an increase. Specifically, changes in statistical sampling methods caused\
  \ an increase in improper and unknown payment rates for Medicare Part C and Medicare\
  \ Part D. More information on these improper payment results and activities can\
  \ be found on PaymentAccuracy.gov and HHS’s annual Agency Financial Report (available\
  \ at HHS.gov/afr).  \n\nIn the latest compliance audit covering FY 2022 results,\
  \ HHS's Inspector General determined that the agency did not comply with PIIA for\
  \ the following reasons:\n\n1) Medicaid and CHIP had improper payment and unknown\
  \ payment rates exceeding 10%.\n2) Not all risk-susceptible programs reported improper\
  \ payment and unknown payment rates.\n3) Medicare FFS did not demonstrate improvements\
  \ in payment integrity.\n4) HHS did not conduct a risk assessment for all programs\
  \ with annual outlays over $10 million at least once every three years.\n5) Recovery\
  \ audits and activities performed to recover improper\npayments for Medicare Part\
  \ C and Medicare Part D programs are delayed or\nmissing cost-effectiveness documentation.\n\
  \nBelow is further information on activities HHS has underway or anticipates implementing\
  \ in the future to help these programs achieve compliance.  \nMedicaid and CHIP:\
  \  HHS works closely with states to create corrective action plans for Medicaid\
  \ and CHIP programs in each state, offering comprehensive technical support and\
  \ guidance to address identified errors and deficiencies. In FY 2021, HHS set a\
  \ new baseline for Medicaid and CHIP under revised eligibility criteria. Estimates\
  \ for both programs decreased in FY 2022 and FY 2023. As of FY 2023, the improper\
  \ and unknown payment rate for Medicaid is under 10%, and HHS expects the program\
  \ to achieve compliance with PIIA in the upcoming compliance audit.\n\nReporting\
  \ Improper Payment Estimates for All Phase 2 Programs:  In FY 2023, HHS will report\
  \ improper payment and unknown payment rates for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program\
  \ and Head Start for the first time. The Foster Care program did not provide an\
  \ improper payment estimate due to the suspension of onsite reviews during the COVID-19\
  \ pandemic in FY 2020. Onsite reviews will resume, and an improper payment rate\
  \ will be reported in FY 2024.\n\nHHS is actively working to establish a methodology\
  \ for measuring and reporting improper payments in the TANF program. In the FY 2024\
  \ President's Budget request, HHS has proposed new statutory authority to collect\
  \ more comprehensive data on TANF. This proposal aims to improve monitoring of TANF\
  \ spending and facilitate the development and reporting of improper payment estimates.\n\
  \nIn FY 2022, HHS reported its first improper payment measurement for the Federally-facilitated\
  \ Exchange for the Advance Premium Tax Credit program. HHS is also developing an\
  \ improper payment methodology for State-based Exchanges and introduced the Improper\
  \ Payment Pre-testing and Assessment program in April 2023 to prepare State Marketplaces\
  \ for the planned improper payment measurement. HHS will continue to update its\
  \ annual agency financial reports with the progress in measurement development and\
  \ implementation.\n\nMedicare Fee-For-Service:  In FY 2023, Medicare FFS maintained\
  \ its improper payment rate below 10% for the seventh consecutive year. HHS strengthened\
  \ corrective measures for Hospice and SNF services, the primary drivers of Medicare\
  \ FFS improper payments.\n\nImproper Payment Risk Assessments:  Agencies are required\
  \ to assess programs with annual outlays exceeding $10 million for improper payment\
  \ risk at least once every three years to identify susceptibility to significant\
  \ improper payments. In FY 2023, HHS assessed 56 programs and found them not susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments. HHS also updated risk assessments and developed\
  \ related policies, procedures, and tools. The agency aims to review and assess\
  \ all programs for significant improper payments by FY 2025.\n\nPart C and Part\
  \ D Recovery Audits:  For Medicare Part C, the Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV)\
  \ audit program, which is the primary corrective action regarding Part C's improper\
  \ payments, performs Part C recovery audit functions. The RADV program is consistent\
  \ with recovery audit requirements and advances corrective actions for the Medicare\

detail_pcp14: 'The OIG has outlined a series of recommendations to enhance the prevention
  and reduction of Improper Payments and Unknown Payments within the agency:


  Address Outstanding Recommendations: HHS should fully address previous recommendations
  related to improper payments, which include conducting regular risk assessments
  for programs with annual outlays exceeding $10 million and developing improper payment
  estimates, reduction targets, and corrective action plans (CAPs) for specific programs
  such as Foster Care, TANF, State-based APTC, Medicare Part C, Medicare Part D, Medicaid,
  and CHIP.


  New Recommendations: In addition to addressing past recommendations, the OIG recommends
  that HHS:


  Calculate improper payment estimates, establish reduction targets, and implement
  CAPs for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program (UIP) and Head Start; and

  Develop and document plans for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) to meet reduction
  targets and demonstrate improvements in payment integrity.


  These recommendations aim to strengthen the agency''s efforts in reducing improper
  payments and enhancing payment integrity across various programs, both by addressing
  existing issues and addressing new findings from the current year.'
