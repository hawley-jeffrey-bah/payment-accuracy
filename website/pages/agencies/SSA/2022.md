detail_ara2_3: 'We meet the recovery activities program requirements of Payment Integrity
  Information Act of 2019 for our benefit programs.  We have no plans to conduct payment
  recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm
  because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental
  Security Income (SSI) programs complexity.  We conducted extensive market research
  prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information
  and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents,
  who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and
  audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The average claims
  representative (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position)
  receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not
  achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for three years.


  We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.275 billion in
  OASDI and SSI benefit overpayments in fiscal year (FY) 2022 at an administrative
  cost of $0.06 on average per dollar collected.  We collected $20.162 billion over
  a 5-year period (FYs 2018–2022).  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt
  collection techniques (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well
  as some external collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement
  Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI
  debts.  From 1992–2022, our external collection techniques have yielded $3.497 billion
  in benefit overpayment recovery.


  We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting,
  and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because
  the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces
  with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation
  system.


  We are making improvement in other aspects of our debt collection program.  In FY
  2018, we began modernization efforts to build a new Debt Management System.  This
  information technology investment is a multi year effort that will build a comprehensive
  overpayment system enabling us to record, track, collect, and report our overpayments
  more efficiently.


  The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments
  paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is
  not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the
  date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions,
  we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we learn of a beneficiary’s
  death.  A financial institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate
  the reclamation timely.


  For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven
  cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying IPs.  In 2013,
  we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency fee
  basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based its review on past
  industry experience of IP rates, and a cost/benefit analysis of transactions processed
  by type and dollars paid.  Because of their minimal recovery, the auditors terminated
  the contract.'

detail_arp18: 'Historically, our remittance process was a largely manual workload
  handled by the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center (MATPSC).  The MATPSC remittance
  process requires a method of payment (check, money order, debit or credit card)
  and a corresponding payment coupon necessary to update a debtor’s record.  In fiscal
  year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements
  to our remittance process.  These enhancements now account for nearly 50 percent
  of our remittance activity.


  In January 2021, we partnered with the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov
  team to implement our first online repayment option for Old-Age, Survivors, and
  Disability Insurance beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income recipients to
  repay benefit overpayments via credit or debit card and automated clearing house
  (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.  In FY 2022, we processed 456,000 remittances
  and collected $92 million through Pay.gov.

  Also, in January 2021, we partnered with Treasury to use U.S. Bank, a financial
  agent for Treasury, to implement a lockbox service to assist with our paper remittance
  processing efforts at the MATPSC.  In FY 2022, we processed 264,000 remittances
  and collected $69 million through the lockbox service.


  In July 2021, we implemented Online Bill Pay (OLBP), allowing debtors to make a
  one-time or recurring ACH draft from a bank account using a personal computer or
  mobile phone.  Prior to this implementation, OLBP remittances defaulted to paper
  checks.  In FY 2022, we processed 18,000 remittances and collected $2.5 million
  through OLBP.'

  applicable to our programs include the General Services Administration’s System
  for Award Management (SAM), our public version of the Death Master File (DMF), and
  Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS).


  SAM:  We comply with regulations to use the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities
  (LEIE), which accomplishes the same purpose as the Exclusions query via SAM.gov.  From
  SAM.gov, we can verify through Entity Registrations if any person or organization
  is registered to do business with the Federal Government and determine a person
  or organization’s eligibility to do business with the Federal Government through
  a check of the Exclusions query.  We are precluded from soliciting offers from,
  awarding contracts to renew, placing or renewing orders with, or otherwise extending
  the duration of a current contract with any entity who has been determined ineligible
  from doing business with the Federal Government unless the head of the agency (or
  designee) determines there is a compelling reason to do so.


  As prescribed in our policy, the State disability determination services (DDS) offices
  are required to check the LEIE at least annually.  Because the DDS offices are State
  agencies, they do not have direct access to DNP.  LEIE includes the names of providers
  excluded from Federally funded health care programs.  The DDS offices also verify
  medical licenses, credentials, and certifications with State medical boards.


  DMF:  The DMF is a publicly available extract of death information created from
  our internal records (i.e., the Numident).  These records contain information, such
  as name, Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death of deceased
  SSN holders.  We update death information on the Numident daily based on information
  from acceptable reporters (e.g., States, funeral homes, and family members).  We
  distribute reported death information to our related records using a complex systems
  interface.  Because our internal death data are more complete than the extracts,
  we do not use DNP for purposes of verifying death.


  State Death Data:  State death data are available to benefit paying agencies and
  other research entities that can legally receive it per Section 205r of the Social
  Security Act.  Per Section 801 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, we will be
  providing Treasury’s DNP with state death data beginning December 2023 for a three-year
  period.


  Prisoner Information:  To comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, we collaborated
  with Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service to provide current prisoner information.  Because
  our PUPS is more complete than the data available via DNP, we use our internal data
  to verify incarceration.'
detail_exs1: "Program integrity workloads are critical to ensuring efficient programs\
  \ and accurate payments in our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI)\
  \ and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.\n\nBased on our fiscal year (FY)\
  \ 2021 stewardship reviews (FY 2022 stewardship information will be available in\
  \ summer 2023), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.1 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.\
  \  Of that total, we estimate almost $2 billion were overpayments, representing\
  \ approximately 0.17 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during\
  \ this same period were $518 million, the equivalent of approximately 0.05 percent\
  \ of outlays.  In the OASDI program, we are maintaining a high payment accuracy\
  \ rate and have been meeting our reduction target for improper payments for the\
  \ last three consecutive years.\n\nOur greatest payment accuracy challenges occur\
  \ within the SSI program.  SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited\
  \ income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI\
  \ program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility\
  \ and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first\
  \ day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment\
  \ accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that\
  \ month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.\
  \  Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause improper payments.\
  \  Improper payments often occur if recipients (or their representative payees on\
  \ their behalf) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors\
  \ (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to\
  \ report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.  \n\
  Based on our FY 2021 stewardship reviews (FY 2022 stewardship information will be\
  \ available in summer 2023), we estimate that we paid approximately $56 billion\
  \ to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $4 billion were overpayments,\
  \ representing approximately 7.2 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments\
  \ during this same period were $873 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.6\
  \ percent of outlays.\n\nOf the estimated $4 billion in overpayments, approximately\
  \ $3.8 billion was due to factors outside of our control because the data or information\
  \ to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible\
  \ to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting\
  \ of employment and wage information.  We are addressing this root cause by conducting\
  \ quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work including SSI non-medical\
  \ redeterminations.  To reduce the reliance on self-reporting, we continue to expand\
  \ and pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors.\n\n\
  Approximately $265 million in overpayments were within our control and due to our\
  \ failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making\
  \ a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly computing\
  \ the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting the\
  \ payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology\
  \ modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools. \
  \ To meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible,\
  \ we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians,\
  \ and automating more of our business processes.\n\nWe implemented the Improper\
  \ Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address\
  \ the root causes of improper payments in both OASDI and SSI programs.  As part\
  \ of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.\
  \  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the\
  \ underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies\
  \ as needed."
