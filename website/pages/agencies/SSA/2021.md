detail_dpa5: "We do not use the Treasury Do Not Pay (DNP) system.  DNP data sources\
  \ applicable to our programs include the General Services Administration’s System\
  \ for Award Management (SAM), our public version of the Death Master File (DMF),\
  \ and Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS).\n\nSAM:  We currently comply with\
  \ regulations to use List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), which accomplishes\
  \ the same purpose as the Exclusions query via SAM.gov.  From SAM.gov, we can verify\
  \ through Entity Registrations if any person or organization is registered to do\
  \ business with the Federal Government and determine a person or organization’s\
  \ eligibility to do business with the Federal Government through a check of the\
  \ Exclusions query.  From SAM.gov, we can verify through Entity Registrations if\
  \ any person or organization is registered to do business with the Federal Government\
  \ and determine a person or organization’s eligibility to do business with the Federal\
  \ Government through a check of the Exclusions query.  We are precluded from soliciting\
  \ offers from, awarding contracts to renew, placing or renewing orders with, or\
  \ otherwise extending the duration of a current contract with any entity who has\
  \ been determined ineligible from doing business with the Federal Government unless\
  \ the head of the agency (or designee) determines there is a compelling reason to\
  \ do so.\n  \nAs prescribed in our policy, the State disability determination services\
  \ (DDS) offices are required to check the LEIE at least annually.  LEIE includes\
  \ the names of providers excluded from Federally funded health care programs.  The\
  \ DDS offices also verify medical licenses, credentials, and certifications with\
  \ State medical boards.  In addition, because the DDS offices are State agencies,\
  \ they do not have direct access to DNP.\n\nDMF:  The DMF is a publicly available\
  \ extract of death information created from our own internal records (i.e., the\
  \ Numident).  These records contain basic information, such as name, Social Security\
  \ number (SSN), date of birth, and date of death of deceased SSN holders.  We update\
  \ death information on the Numident daily based on information from acceptable reporters\
  \ (e.g., States, funeral homes, and family members).  We distribute reported death\
  \ information to our related records using a complex systems interface.  Because\
  \ our internal death data is more complete than the extracts, we do not use DNP\
  \ for purposes of verifying death.\n\nPrisoner Information:  To comply with the\
  \ Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, we collaborated with Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal\
  \ Service to provide current prisoner information.  Because our PUPS is more complete\
  \ than the data available via DNP, we use our own internal data to verify incarceration.\n"
