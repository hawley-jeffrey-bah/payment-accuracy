detail_dpa5: 'Participating in the Do Not Pay (DNP)  initiative is included in the
  EAC''s agreement with the Bureau of Fiscal Service''s Administrative Resource Center''s
  (ARC). BFS ARC does continuous monitoring of the suppliers in the Oracle financial
  system. They submit a report of supplier numbers and tax IDs into the Federal Reserve
  DNP folder once a week. That report is processed, and the reports are available
  the following morning. If there are any suppliers of concern, BFS immediately deactivates
  them with the end date, so they cannot be used to pay future payments.

detail_exs1: 'The US Election Assistance Commission did not have any significant improper
  payments to report for FY 2023. The EAC is a Phase 1 agency with outlays over $10M,
  but no programs that are likely to be susceptible to improper payments. The EAC
  was found to be fully compliant by its Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in
  its last PIIA compliance review. The EAC is also on a three-year risk assessment
  cycle and a formal risk assessment was completed in FY 2023 which will be provided
  to the agency OIG during its next PIIA compliance review.


  Additionally, the EAC continues to implement various other mechanisms to prevent
  improper payments. For example, the OIG PIIA compliance review, risk assessments
  (done most recently by a third party), as well as a post payment/recapture audit
  as a part of the agency''s services through the Bureau of Fiscal Service. The EAC
  also continues to ensure various payment transactions go through proper layers of
  review and approval.'
