Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Internal Revenue Service - Additional Child Tax Credit
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Data from the Social Security Administration provides IRS with substantial
      information about citizenship, but it is not sufficient to determine whether
      taxpayers and their children meet the citizenship eligibility criteria in all
      cases.
    Info: The child must be a U.S. citizen, national, or resident alien.
    Theme: Citizenship
  - Barriers: Although the IRS has access to Social Security Administration data linking
      child and parent SSNs, which can substantiate some taxpayer-child relationships,
      it is not sufficient to allow IRS to determine in all cases whether a non-parent
      claiming a child meets the relationship eligibility criteria.
    Info: 'The child must have one of the following relationships to the taxpayer:
      son, daughter, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, sibling, step-sibling, half-sibling,  or
      the descendant of any of these.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: There is no third-party source of information that allows IRS to verify
      self-employment income, and some forms of investment income are similarly not
      reported by third parties to IRS. Form W-2 payer information is available to
      the IRS and is used for some income verification, but this depends on the timeliness
      and accuracy of the information provided by payers. Together this means that
      the IRS is not able to fully match wages and other income sources against the
      return at time of filing for all taxpayers or the children being claimed for
      the ACTC.
    Info: To be an eligible dependent, the child cannot provide more than half of
      his or her own financial support during the tax year. The amount of the ACTC
      depends in part on the amount of earned income, including self-employment income.
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: Data provided by the Social Security Administration does not allow IRS
      to determine whether a SSN has been issued solely for the purpose of receiving
      federally funded benefits, and so data do not exist that would allow IRS to
      prevent improper payments based on this aspect of the SSN eligibility criteria.
    Info: This child must have a social security number that is valid for employment
      (not issued solely for the purpose of receiving federal benefits) and issued
      before the due date of the return.
    Theme: Identity
  - Barriers: No database exists for IRS to determine marital status or living arrangements
      of taxpayers or children claimed on returns.
    Info: Marital status is relevant for determining the correct filing status of
      the taxpayer, which can affect the calculation of the amount of the credit.
      In addition, there are restrictions on the marital status of children that are
      claimed for the ACTC.
    Theme: Marital Status
  - Barriers: No database exists that would allow IRS to determine the residency of
      children, the shared residency between the child and the taxpayer, or the shared
      residency of married taxpayers.
    Info: The child must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half the year.
      Residency of primary taxpayers can also determine correct filing status, which
      may impact the calculation of the amount of the credit.

- Program_Name: Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Although the IRS has access to Social Security Administration data linking
      child and parent SSNs, which can substantiate some taxpayer-child relationships,
      it is not sufficient to allow IRS to determine in all cases whether a non-parent
      claiming a child meets the relationship eligibility criteria.
    Info: 'The qualifying student must be either the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse,
      or an individual whom a taxpayer can claim as a dependent. There are many eligibility
      criteria for dependency, including relationship; specifically, the child must
      have one of the following relationships to the taxpayer: son, daughter, grandchild,
      stepchild, foster child, sibling, step-sibling, half-sibling, or the descendant
      of any of these.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: Educational institutions send Form 1098-T to IRS reporting tuition and
      other qualified education expenses, along with some information related to the
      eligibility criteria.  However, the Form 1098-T does not report all eligibility
      criteria, and even for criteria that is reported, the data is not available
      to confirm eligibility during return processing. Furthermore, IRS lacks the
      statutory authority to disallow American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) claims
      missing Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement. Complex requirements for reporting qualifying
      educational expenses may cause discrepancies between what the taxpayer inputs
      on Form 8863, Education Credits, and what the institution enters on Form 1098-T
      and may or may not reflect taxpayer error. Conversely, because the amount of
      qualifying educational expenses reported by institutions on the Form 1098-T
      may not align with the AOTC definition, a match between the amounts on Form
      8863 and Form 1098-T does not necessarily imply a correct claim. Therefore,
      even if Form 1098-T data were available at the time of filing and even if IRS
      had congressional authority to adjust or disallow the AOTC based on information
      provided on the Form 1098-T, those data may not be sufficiently reliable for
      the IRS to act to prevent improper payments without undue burden on taxpayers.
      Another barrier is that IRS does not have congressional authority to disallow
      the claim when taxpayers claim students for more than the four-year statutory
      limit. A small segment of errors is for students that appear not to be enrolled
      at least half-time or to have exceeded four years of postsecondary education,
      although again the Form 1098-T data does not perfectly reflect the AOTC requirements.
      And an even smaller portion of errors are attributable to instances where more
      than one taxpayer claims the same student. The IRS processes returns as they
      are filed and is unaware of duplicate situations when the first return is filed,
      or which taxpayer is qualified in such a situation.
    Info: To claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit, the taxpayer must have paid
      qualified education expenses for an eligible student for the first four years
      of higher education. To be eligible for the AOTC, the student must (1) be pursuing
      a degree or other recognized education credential, (2) be enrolled at least
      half time for at least one academic period beginning in the tax year, (3) not
      have finished the first four years of higher education at the beginning of the
      tax year, (4) not have claimed the American Opportunity Tax Credit or the former
      Hope credit for more than four tax years, and (5) not have a felony drug conviction
      at the end of the tax year.
    Theme: Education
  - Barriers: There is no third-party source of information for some forms of income,
      particularly self-employment income and some forms of investment income. Form
      W-2 payer information is available to the IRS and is used for some income verification,
      but this depends on the timeliness and accuracy of the information provided
      by payers. Together this means that the IRS is not able to fully match wages
      and other income sources against the return at time of filing for all taxpayers
      claiming the American Opportunity Tax Credit.
    Info: 'To be eligible for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, the taxpayer must
      have modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) less than $90,000 (married filing
      jointly $180,000), with partial credit given for MAGI between $80,000 and $90,000
      (married joint-filers between $160,000 and $180,000).

      '
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: No database exists for IRS to determine marital status or living arrangements
      of taxpayers or children claimed on returns.
    Info: The marital status of the taxpayer can affect the correct filing status
      that should be used by the taxpayer, and this in turn affects the phase-out
      ranges of income that can determine the amount of the American Opportunity Tax
      Credit as well as exemptions and other credits, which can also affect the credit
      amount. Marital status may also be relevant since the ability to claim an individual
      as a dependent and therefore a student, depends on their marital status.
    Theme: Marital Status
  - Barriers: No database exists that would allow IRS to determine the residency of
      children, the shared residency between the child and the taxpayer, or the shared
      residency of married taxpayers.
    Info: The qualifying student must be either the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse,
      or an individual whom a taxpayer can claim as a dependent. There are many eligibility
      criteria for dependency, including residency, which requires that the child
      must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half the year.
    Theme: Residency
- Program_Name: Internal Revenue Service - Earned Income Tax Credit
  Themes:
  - Barriers: There is no comprehensive data source that allows IRS to determine if
      the individuals claimed for Earned Income Tax Credit are permanently and totally
      disabled.
    Info: Individuals that are over age 18 are eligible to be claimed for Earned Income
      Tax Credit if they are  "permanently and totally disabled.”
    Theme: Affiliation
  - Barriers: Data from the Social Security Administration provides IRS with substantial
      information about citizenship, but it is not sufficient to determine whether
      taxpayers and their children meet the citizenship eligibility criteria in all
      cases and therefore cannot be used to prevent improper payments.
    Info: The taxpayer must be a U.S. citizen, national or resident alien all year.

      or the descendant of any of these.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: There is no comprehensive data source that allows IRS to determine if
      the child is a full-time student.
    Info: Children that are younger than the taxpayer but are over age 18 and under
      age 24 are only eligible to be claimed for Earned Income Tax Credit if they
      are full-time students or permanently and totally disabled.

    Info: 'To be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit,  adjusted gross income
      and earned income must fall below certain thresholds that vary depending on
      the number of children claimed. Investment income must not exceed a certain
      amount. (See 1040 instructions for specific amounts)

  - Barriers: No database exists for IRS to determine marital status or living arrangements
      of taxpayers.
    Info: 'If married, the taxpayers must file jointly or meet certain other criteria:
      either living apart for the last six months of the tax year or being legally
      separated according to state law under a written separation agreement or a decree
      of separate maintenance and not living in the same household at the end of the
      year.  For unmarried taxpayers, they must file as either single or head of household
      and meet the criteria for those.'

  - Barriers: "No database exists that would allow IRS to determine the residency\
      \ of children or the shared residency between the child and the taxpayer.  \n"
    Info: "A qualifying child for Earned Income Tax Credit must have the same main\
      \ home as the primary taxpayer (or spouse if filing jointly) in United States\
      \ for more than half of the year. \n"

      claiming the Premium Tax Credit.
    Info: Eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit and the correct amount of the credit
      to which the taxpayer is entitled depend on taxpayer income.
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: No database exists for IRS to determine living arrangements and household
      size of taxpayers.

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CTC) conducted
    a risk assessment in FY 23 and although the risk assessment yielded a non-susceptible
    rating the IRS deems this program as susceptible to improper payments due to the
    similarity of this program with other programs that have high improper payment
    error rates. Tax year (TY) 2021 CTC was designed and implemented as part of the
    COVID-19 assistance programs; thus, the credit is similarly temporary in nature
    and has no basis for future improper payment estimates.  To estimate improper
    payment rates for refundable tax credits, the IRS must perform comprehensive audits
    over a large sample of tax returns.  Given the statutory timelines, IRS needs
    a minimum of three years to calculate an estimated improper payment rate for a
    given program, which in this case will be long after the TY 2021 CTC has ended.

detail_agy1: 'The root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs
  is not the result of internal control deficiencies.  The IRS has continuously deployed
  costly enforcement tools to lower the error rate.  Deployment of these enforcement
  tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate.  As such, we have long
  held that focusing enforcement resources on the larger tax gap is a more efficient
  and cost-effective way to minimize the tax gap and maximize tax collections.  We
  continue to support the reporting of RTC errors as part of the tax gap estimate
  as a better reflection of how the IRS approaches taxpayer compliance relative to
  the U.S. tax system.


  The statutory structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds
  prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such amounts prior to making a refund.
  Consequently, errors are not the result of internal control weaknesses that we can
  remediate internally but are, in fact, the result of factors beyond our control
  under current law and existing authority.  Even if we could obtain legislative changes
  and invest in additional resources and verification solutions that would ultimately
  reduce errors, the benefits derived would be marginal relative to the costs.  As
  such, it is our position that RTC refunds that result in errors are more appropriately
  addressed within the tax gap framework, which is how we manage noncompliance.'

  subject to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for
  that month. Invoices not processed through the IPP in excess of $2,500.00 are subject
  to secondary review before being paid. Invoices under $2,500.00 are subject to review
  through statistical sampling procedures. Travel vouchers processed through the Concur
  Government Edition (CGE) travel system are subject to a post payment audit based
  on a random sample of all reimbursements under $2,500. All payments of $2,500.00
  and higher are excluded from the population. These payments require a 100% post
  payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed through the MoveLINQ system
  are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review. For payment customers, once the
  vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment, they are interfaced to
  Oracle, the financial system, through which they are paid.


  The DNP portal implementation has provided a way for our procurement and payable
  offices to review vendor files prior to disbursement. It has also given us an opportunity
  to review the monthly payment file results to identify any improper payments made
  to a vendor in the DNP portal.'
detail_ara2_2: 'Majority of these cases were erroneous personnel actions that when
  corrected resulted in overpayment to the employee.


  5 U.S.C. Section 5584 authorizes waivers of debt claims due to the United States
  if it can be shown there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or
  lack of good faith on the part of the employee. Since the debt was established due
  to a corrected personnel action, the decision to grant or deny the waiver turns
  on fault. Fault exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is found that the
  individual knew or should have known that they received an erroneous payment.'
detail_ara2_3: "Fiscal Service programs- Management has determined that conducting\
  \ recovery audits would not be cost-effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based\
  \ on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies.\
  \ Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted\
  \ before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to\
  \ request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.\n\nInternal\
  \ Revenue Service (IRS) Programs- Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary\
  \ for Management, dated March 20, 2014, IRS custodial/bond programs are exempt from\
  \ Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury determined that it considers these payments\
  \ negative revenue receipts- not outlays- and thereby\nexempt them from improper\
  \ payment requirements. OMB believed this is a reasonable approach, however these\
  \ custodial/bond programs are still required to assess for risk. IRS programs that\
  \ are not custodial/bond programs submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt\
  \ them from recovery auditing. The five year average cost of recovery auditing far\
  \ exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured\
  \ through recovery auditing, however, all funds recaptured were identified through\
  \ normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment\
  \ reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering\
  \ improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders.\n\nIRS- fund\
  \ groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic created through the American Rescue Plan\
  \ Act of 2021, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, provided a justification\
  \ for determination that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current\
  \ business practices (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical\
  \ samples conducted under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification\
  \ of overpayments. The IRS’s robust information\ntechnology platform includes several\
  \ filters to monitor the accuracy of eligibility\nrules and payment certification\
  \ for the various tax credits.\n\nThe Office of International Assistance provided\
  \ a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments\
  \ for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit\
  \ which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash\
  \ payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before\
  \ all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective\
  \ to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller\
  \ of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing\
  \ to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper\
  \ payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments\
  \ - invoices, travel card, purchase card,\npayroll, and benefits) has resulted in\
  \ a low risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls\
  \ over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal\
  \ reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs\
  \ an annual review using analytic techniques of contract payments to identify potential\
  \ fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency\
  \ and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures\
  \ of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment\
  \ recapture audit activities conducted required a higher cost in employee resources\
  \ than the amount recovered.\n\nThe Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective\
  \ justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group\
  \ have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification\
  \ was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group\
  \ conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management\
  \ determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund\
  \ group.\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective\
  \ justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of this justification\
  \ is the BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments.\
  \ Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates\
  \ to\n.004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment\
  \ and post-payment reviews.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct\
  \ Loan Financing program is at low risk for improper payments. This loan program\
  \ is unique in that it contains a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there\
  \ were eight recipients that received eight large payments and in total, the program\
  \ disbursed loans to 35 recipients. Program participants entered into stringent\
  \ legal agreements per guidance stipulated in the CARES Act and instituted per Treasury.\
  \ There were significant reviews performed at the onset of the program including\
  \ several levels of review regarding program loan terms and documentation. Further,\
  \ given these disbursements are loans, which are closely monitored for potential\
  \ default, Treasury expects to receive the funds back. \n\nDepartmental Office-\
  \ Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment recovery process instituted\
  \ within the program’s internal controls system and the risks of improper payments\
  \ are low, the potential benefit of conducting a separate\npayment recapture audit\
  \ is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment recovery process is comprised\
  \ of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying that the prorated payments\
  \ are within the established percentages and maximum payments allowed for each program\
  \ participant. The cost of\nperforming a payment recapture audit would outweigh\
  \ any potential benefit.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Coronavirus Economic Relief for\
  \ Transportation Services (CERTS)- The CERTS program identified one instance of\
  \ overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both were 100% recaptured, and\
  \ represent less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS\
  \ program has since completed all of its awards to recipients and is shifting to\
  \ the recipient monitoring\nphase of the program. Since there is a low prevalence\
  \ of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate,\
  \ the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal.\
  \ Therefore, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh any potential\
  \ benefit.\n\nDepartmental Office- Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund\
  \ (SLFRF)- In FY 2021 SLFRF identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured,\
  \ and represent less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each of these three\
  \ cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions\
  \ on how to return funds to Treasury. SLFRF worked closely with the ORP Payment\
  \ Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure the returned amount was documented\
  \ accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which serves as the ORP payment system of\
  \ record. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control activities\
  \ to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity review, the risks of\
  \ improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment\
  \ recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture\
  \ audit would outweigh any potential benefit.\n\nDepartmental Office- Emergency\
  \ Rental Assistance- Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating entities\
  \ are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments team uses\
  \ various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce.\
  \ Initial eligibility of recipients is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments\
  \ are approved for disbursement after\nundergoing a multi-step validation process\
  \ to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are\
  \ disbursed following the standard ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented\
  \ multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal\
  \ controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit\
  \ of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\
  \nDepartmental Offices- Homeowner Assistance Fund- Eligibility for payments from\
  \ Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory\
  \ allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information,\
  \ such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients are\
  \ verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after\n\
  undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount,\
  \ and timing. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing\
  \ from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper\
  \ payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture\
  \ audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Emergency\
  \ Capital Investment Program- During the application phase, ECIP consulted with\
  \ the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial\
  \ institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting\
  \ process was conducted in coordination\nwith teams of community development finance\
  \ and financial institutions and external financial advisers. ECIP program management\
  \ was required to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures\
  \ which incorporated risk management controls and included multiple layers of review.\
  \ Since the\nprogram has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple\
  \ outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and\
  \ the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal\
  \ and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental Offices/Office of Recovery Programs-\
  \ Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF)-  LATCF has maintained its\
  \ own listing and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility\
  \ risk of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels\
  \ of internal/quality controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment\
  \ integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low.\n\nDepartmental Offices/Office\
  \ of Recovery Programs- State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)- The SSBCI\
  \ program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts\
  \ post-approval procedures through SSBCI’s Compliance Program. The application process\
  \ includes checks to validate \nidentity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate\
  \ inputs for the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant\
  \ is not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing\
  \ improper payments.\n\nSpecial Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)-\
  \ SIGPR has an established inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement\
  \ (SLA) in place with the Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial\
  \ Services program for providing financial support services. As it relates\nspecifically\
  \ to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing\
  \ funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis.\
  \ ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine\
  \ basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established\
  \ thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to\
  \ ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting\
  \ and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based\
  \ on established thresholds.\nSince there are payment recovery processes included\
  \ within the aforementioned policies and procedures and the risks of improper payments\
  \ are low, the potential benefit of conducting separate payment recapture audits\
  \ is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nOffice of DC Pensions (DCP)-  DCP's largest\
  \ payment area, benefits, has a robust multi-tier quality review program that includes\
  \ in-depth annuitant case review as a part of their normal course of business. Through\
  \ DCP's quality review program, significant numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed\
  \ monthly and when errors are detected, benefit payments are corrected and debt\
  \ collection activities begin, as applicable. In addition, all contract payments\
  \ and Federal Employee Payments include a second level review prior to payment submission."

detail_cap4: 'The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its payment program to
  an improper rate of less than 10 percent.  The IRS captures metrics related to pre-refund
  activities and works closely with internal and external partners to expand outreach
  efforts.  Many of these metrics are tied to the pre-refund examination program and
  are highly dependent on assumptions such as available staff. The Refund Integrity
  and Compliance Services (RICS) Director conducts quarterly operational reviews with
  Refundable Credits Examination Operations (RCEO) and Refundable Credits Program
  Management (RCPM) on the refundable credits program. The RICS and RCPM Directors
  and managers have performance plan commitments that address enhancements to the
  program such as increasing refundable credit awareness, encouraging eligible taxpayers
  to apply for those credits, and emphasizing tax return accuracy. As noted, taxpayers
  self-certify eligibility for refundable tax credits and that the return is accurate.


  The IRS performance plans also balance the outreach and awareness component with
  its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer
  experience and improve the efficiencies in its processes and enhance case selection.  These
  plans are tied to management’s ratings ranging from Not Met to Outstanding and utilizes
  the SMART approach to ensure tangible results.'

detail_dpa5: "The use of Do Not Pay is considered on Treasury's PIIA risk assessments.\
  \ In FY 23, all applicable fund groups who completed risk assessments used the Do\
  \ Not Pay portal prior to payment disbursement.\n\nAdditionally, the Vendor Supply\
  \ Group does continuous monitoring of all suppliers using the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal.\
  \ On a weekly basis all active suppliers are submitted and processed in a nightly\
  \ run that returns a list of suppliers which matched against the database with the\
  \ results that could indicate they should not be paid by the government. Most results\
  \ seen are either deceased individuals or suppliers that have not reviewed and approved\
  \ their records in the SAM database within the past year and therefore their SAM\
  \ registration is not current. All suppliers found on this list are immediately\
  \ end dated so they cannot be used. On the rare occasion the system indicated the\
  \ vendor should not be paid for other reasons the Customer Care accountant is notified\
  \ to follow up with the Customer. \nIn addition, on a regular daily basis the DNP\
  \ portal is used to submit Disaster Recovery Applicants.\n"
detail_exs1: "Treasury programs in phase 1 are required to complete a PIIA risk assessment\
  \ once every three years. In FY 23, 29 programs completed a risk assessment. The\
  \ years in between risk assessments, we require programs to complete a certification\
  \ which states there has been no major changes to program funding or legislation\
  \ that could impact the risk of improper payments.\n\nTreasury reports error rates\
  \ as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix C, for four refundable tax credits (RTCs)—the\
  \ Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Additional\
  \ Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Treasury was found\
  \ non-compliant with PIIA in FY 22 due to not meeting the compliance criteria of\
  \ reporting an improper payment rate of less than 10%.\n\nThe root cause of the\
  \ errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal\
  \ control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly enforcement\
  \ tools to lower the error rate. These tools include training, such as the nationwide\
  \ tax forum, due diligence training module and webinars, cross enterprise sharing\
  \ with other Federal agencies, and change processes such as hosting annual Dependent\
  \ Database (DDb) meetings with stakeholders to adjust the value of prior-year compliance\
  \ filters for audit selection of returns claiming the RTCs and identifying improvement\
  \ opportunities for the filing season. Deployment of enforcement tools has had minimal\
  \ impact on lowering the error rate. The IRS continues significant efforts to bring\
  \ its payment program to an improper rate of less than 10 percent. Without significant\
  \ legislative action and restructuring of the refundable tax credit (RTC) programs,\
  \ meeting a target date to be in compliance with PIIA will be a significant challenge.\n\
  \nThe error rates for the four RTC programs that are susceptible to improper payments\
  \ are not statistically different from the FY 22 error rates. Although the EITC\
  \ and ACTC error rates increased, the margin of error is larger than in prior years.\
  \ We would expect more variability in the estimates with the larger margins of error.\
  \ The wider sample precision margins are the result of a reduction in the number\
  \ of returns sampled that was necessitated by the significant reduction in the IRS’s\
  \ budget over the last decade along with the resulting decrease in the IRS’s examination\
  \ staff.  Additionally, regarding the ACTC, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\
  \ (ARPA) included a one-time, one-year amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of\
  \ 1986, expanding the existing Child Tax Credit (CTC) laws for tax year 2021, which\
  \ provided Child Tax Credit Improvements for Tax Year (TY) 2021 (TY 2021 CTC). ACTC’s\
  \ improper payment rate is exclusive of TY 2021 CTC.  TY 2021 CTC is structured\
  \ and processed differently than any previous non-refundable CTC, as eligible taxpayers\
  \ automatically received advance payments (unless they opted-out) and later had\
  \ to reconcile the credit on their 2021 tax returns.  \n"

detail_pcp14: The OIG did not provide any recommendations to further improve prevention
  and reduction of improper payments,
detail_raa8: 'No'
detail_raa9: The IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CTC) conducted a risk assessment
  in FY 23 and although the risk assessment yielded a non-susceptible rating the IRS
  deems this program as susceptible to improper payments due to the similarity of
  this program with other programs that have high improper payment error rates. Tax
  year (TY) 2021 CTC was designed and implemented as part of the COVID-19 assistance
  programs; thus, the credit is similarly temporary in nature and has no basis for
  future improper payment estimates.  To estimate improper payment rates for refundable
  tax credits, the IRS must perform comprehensive audits over a large sample of tax
  returns.  Given the statutory timelines, IRS needs a minimum of three years to calculate
  an estimated improper payment rate for a given program, which in this case will
  be long after the TY 2021 CTC has ended.
