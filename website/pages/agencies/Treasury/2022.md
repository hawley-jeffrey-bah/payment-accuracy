detail_ara2_1: "Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are\
  \ subject to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices\
  \ for that month.  Invoices not processed through the Invoice Processing Platform\
  \ (IPP) in excess of $2,500.00 are subject to secondary review before being paid.\
  \  Invoices under $2,500.00 are subject to review through statistical sampling procedures.\
  \  Travel vouchers processed through the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel\
  \ system are subject to a post payment audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements\
  \ under $2,500.   All payments of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population.\
  \ These payments require a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed\

  \t\t\t\t\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"
detail_ara2_2: Most of the amounts determined to not be collectable were due to travel
  or payroll improper payments. In the case of the Office of DC Pensions, individual
  debt cases deemed uncollectible after thorough reviews resulted in determinations
  to cease active collection actions.
detail_ara2_3: "Fiscal Service programs- Management has determined that conducting\
  \ recovery audits would not be cost-effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based\
  \ on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies.\
  \ Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted\
  \ before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to\
  \ request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.\n\nInternal\
  \ Revenue Service Programs-  Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for\
  \ Management, dated March 20, 2014, IRS custodial/bond programs are exempt from\
  \ Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury determined that it considers these payments\
  \ negative revenue receipts- not outlays- and thereby exempt them from improper\
  \ payment requirements. OMB believed this is a reasonable approach, however these\
  \ custodial/bond programs are still required to assess for risk. IRS programs that\
  \ are not custodial/bond programs submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt\
  \ them from recovery auditing. The five year average cost of recovery auditing far\
  \ exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured\
  \ through recovery auditing, however, all funds recaptured were identified through\
  \ normal operating processes and collected through established procedures. Pre-payment\
  \ reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and recovering\
  \ improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders.\n\nThe Office\
  \ of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification to OMB for\
  \ recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two forms: payment\
  \ vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank\
  \ of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews\
  \ are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined that it\
  \ would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group.\n\
  \nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective\
  \ justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based\
  \ on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories\
  \ of payments (contract payments - invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll,\
  \ and benefits) has resulted in a low risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC\
  \ has strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The\
  \ OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and\
  \ other transactions. The OCC performs an annual review using analytic techniques\
  \ of contract payments to identify potential fraudulent activity or other payment\
  \ anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government\
  \ travel and purchase cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed\
  \ policies and procedures. The most recent payment recapture audit activities conducted\
  \ required a higher cost in employee resources than the amount recovered.\n\nThe\
  \ Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018.\
  \ The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since\
  \ 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification was established\
  \ yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment\
  \ and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would\
  \ not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group.\n\nThe Bureau\
  \ of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery\
  \ auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of this justification is the BEP's risk assessments\
  \ are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years found that\
  \ the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to .004% of the total disbursements\
  \ for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment reviews.\n\n\
  Departmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct Loan Financing program is at\
  \ low risk for improper payments. This loan program is unique in that it contains\
  \ a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there were eight recipients that received\
  \ eight large payments and in total, the program disbursed loans to 35 recipients.\
  \ Program participants entered into stringent legal agreements per guidance stipulated\
  \ in the CARES Act and instituted per Treasury. There were significant reviews performed\
  \ at the onset of the program including several levels of review regarding program\
  \ loan terms and documentation. Further, given these disbursements are loans, which\
  \ are closely monitored for potential default, Treasury expects to receive the funds\
  \ back. As of September 1, 2021, approximately half of the disbursements have been\
  \ repaid.\n\nDepartmental Office- Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment\
  \ recovery process instituted within the program’s internal controls system and\
  \ the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting a\
  \ separate\npayment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment\
  \ recovery process is comprised of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying\
  \ that the prorated payments are within the established percentages and maximum\
  \ payments allowed for each program participant. The cost of performing a payment\
  \ recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.\n\nDepartmental Offices-\
  \ Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS)-  The CERTS program\
  \ identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both\
  \ were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 0.1% of the total program awards.\
  \ As of August 2022, the CERTS program has since completed all of its awards to\
  \ recipients and is shifting to the recipient monitoring phase of the program. \
  \ Since there is a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients,\
  \ and a 100% recapture rate, the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment\
  \ recapture audit is minimal.  Therefore, the cost of performing a recapture audit\
  \ would outweigh any potential benefit.  \n\nDepartmental Office- Coronavirus State\
  \ and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF)-  In FY 2021 SLFRF identified three overpayments,\
  \ which were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 1.0% of the total program\
  \ awards.   In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments\
  \ and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury.  SLFRF worked\
  \ closely with the ORP Payment Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure\
  \ the returned amount was documented accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which\
  \ serves as the ORP payment system of record.  Since the program has implemented\
  \ multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of\
  \ payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential\
  \ benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore,\
  \ the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential\
  \ benefit. \n\nDepartmental Office- Emergency Rental Assistance-  Eligibility for\
  \ payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according\
  \ to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the\
  \ information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients\
  \ is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement\
  \ after undergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar\
  \ amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are disbursed following the standard\
  \ ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review\
  \ (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the risks\
  \ of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate\
  \ payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental Offices-\
  \ Homeowner Assistance Fund-   Eligibility for payments from Treasury to participating\
  \ entities are made by Treasury according to statutory allocations. The payments\
  \ team uses various systems to validate the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle,\
  \ and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients are verified using the Do Not\
  \ Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement after undergoing a multi-step\
  \ validation process to verify the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Since the\
  \ program has implemented multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data\
  \ sources) into its internal controls system, the risks of improper payments are\
  \ low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit\
  \ is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Emergency Capital\
  \ Investment Program- During the application phase, ECIP consulted with the primary\
  \ federal regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution)\
  \ to confirm that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was\
  \ conducted in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial\
  \ institutions and external financial advisers.  ECIP program management was required\
  \ to approve each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated\
  \ risk management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program\
  \ has implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent\
  \ assessments, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit\
  \ of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\
  \nSpecial Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)- SIGPR has an established\
  \ inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement (SLA) in place with the\
  \ Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for\
  \ providing financial support services.  As it relates specifically to recovery\
  \ processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as performing funds\
  \ control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis.\
  \  ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine\
  \ basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established\
  \ thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies and procedures to\
  \ ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily financial reporting\
  \ and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based\
  \ on established thresholds. Since there are payment recovery processes included\
  \ within the aforementioned policies and procedures and the risks of improper payments\
  \ are low, the potential benefit of conducting separate payment recapture audits\
  \ is minimal and would be duplicative.\n"

detail_exs1: "Treasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix\
  \ C, for four  refundable tax credits—the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC. \n\nThe\
  \ root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the\
  \ result of internal control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously\
  \ deployed costly enforcement tools to lower the error rate.  Deployment of these\
  \ enforcement tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate.  Between\
  \ FY 2006 and FY 2022, Treasury’s error rates for EITC have ranged from 22.8 percent\
  \ to 31.6 percent.  As such, we have long held that focusing enforcement resources\
  \ on the larger tax gap is a more efficient and cost-effective way to minimize the\
  \ tax gap and maximize tax collections.  We continue to support the reporting of\
  \ RTC errors as part of the tax gap estimate as a better reflection of how the IRS\
  \ approaches taxpayer compliance relative to the U.S. tax system.\n\nThese RTCs\
  \ are not “payments” as intended under the improper payments legislation, as the\
  \ tax system is a collection system rather than a payment system.  Whereas a payment\
  \ system is generally designed to implement internal controls that provide for appropriate\
  \ verification and validation prior to payments being made, the statutory structure\
  \ and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds prevents the IRS from\
  \ verifying or validating such amounts prior to making a refund.  Consequently,\
  \ refundable tax credit errors are not the result of internal control weaknesses\
  \ that we can remediate internally but are, in fact, the result of factors beyond\
  \ our control under current law and existing authority.  Even if we could obtain\
  \ legislative changes and invest in additional resources and verification solutions\
  \ that would ultimately reduce errors, the benefits derived would be marginal relative\
  \ to the cost of doing so.  As such, it is our position that refundable tax credit\
  \ refunds that result in errors should not be reported under the improper payments\
  \ framework.  Rather they are more appropriately addressed in the tax gap estimate,\
  \ which is how we manage noncompliance.\n"
