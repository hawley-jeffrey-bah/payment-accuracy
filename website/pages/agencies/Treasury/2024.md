  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'Data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) provides IRS with
      substantial information about citizenship, but it is not sufficient to determine
      whether taxpayers and their children meet the citizenship eligibility criteria
      in all cases. SSA may have basic citizenship and residency information, but
      it might not be clear whether the taxpayer''s status was valid for the entire
      tax year (as required for Additional Child Tax Credit eligibility). Without
      this full scope of information for this specific, nuanced citizenship eligibility
      criteria, the IRS has to rely on taxpayer self-certification of eligibility.
      The fundamental root causes of Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments
      are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process;
      (2) the inability to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information
      needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer
      without any third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring
      the IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is
      accurate.'
    Info: The child must be a U.S. citizen, national, or resident alien.
    Theme: Citizenship
  - Barriers: 'Although the IRS has access to Social Security Administration (SSA)
      data linking child and parent Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which can substantiate
      some taxpayer-child relationships, it is not sufficient to allow IRS to determine
      in all cases whether a non-parent claiming a child meets the relationship eligibility
      criteria. When the familial relationship is more complex than parent-child,
      it becomes more difficult to verify eligibility based on SSA data; therefore,
      the IRS would have to rely on taxpayer self-certification. The fundamental root
      causes of Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1)
      there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) the inability
      to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
      taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any
      third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the
      IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate.'
    Info: 'The child must have one of the following relationships to the taxpayer:
      son, daughter, grandchild, stepchild, foster child, sibling, step-sibling, half-sibling,
      or the descendant of any of these.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: 'Third-party sources of information are generally insufficient to allow
      IRS to verify self-employment income and some forms of investment income. Form
      W-2 payer information is available to the IRS and is used for some income verification,
      but this depends on the timeliness and accuracy of the information provided
      by payers. Together this means that the IRS is not able to fully match wages
      and other income sources against the return at time of filing for all taxpayers
      or the children being claimed for the Additional Child Tax Credit.  The fundamental
      root causes of Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows:
      (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) the inability
      to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
      taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any
      third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the
      IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate.'
    Info: To be an eligible dependent, the child cannot provide more than half of
      his or her own financial support during the tax year. The amount of the Additional
      Child Tax Credit depends in part on the amount of earned income, including self-employment
      income.
    Theme: Financial
  - Barriers: 'Data provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not
      allow IRS to determine whether a social security number (SSN) has been issued
      solely for the purpose of receiving federally funded benefits, and so data does
      not exist that would allow IRS to prevent improper payments based on this aspect
      of the SSN eligibility criteria. For Additional Child Tax Credit eligibility,
      the taxpayer and any qualifying children must have valid SSNs that are issued
      for work purposes. SSA does not always distinguish between SSNs issued for work
      purposes versus non-work purposes in a way that is clearly flagged for the IRS.
      The fundamental root causes of Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments
      are as follows: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process;

    Info: This child must have a social security number that is valid for employment
      (not issued solely for the purpose of receiving federal benefits) and issued
      before the due date of the return.

  - Barriers: 'No database exists for IRS to determine marital status or living arrangements
      of taxpayers or children claimed on returns. The fundamental root causes of
      Additional Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a
      statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) the inability to wholesale

      self-certification that all return information is accurate.'
    Info: Marital status is relevant for determining the correct filing status of
      the taxpayer, which can affect the calculation of the amount of the credit.
      In addition, there are restrictions on the marital status of children that are
      claimed for the Additional Child Tax Credit.
    Theme: Marital Status
  - Barriers: 'No database exists that would allow IRS to determine the residency
      of children, the shared residency between the child and the taxpayer, or the
      shared residency of married taxpayers. The fundamental root causes of Additional
      Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory

      self-certification that all return information is accurate.'
    Info: The child must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half the year.
      Residency of primary taxpayers can also determine correct filing status, which
      may impact the calculation of the amount of the credit.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: Although the IRS has access to Social Security Administration (SSA)
      data linking child and parent Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which can substantiate
      some taxpayer-child relationships, it is not sufficient to allow IRS to determine
      in all cases whether a non-parent claiming a child meets the relationship eligibility
      criteria. When the familial relationship is more complex than parent-child,
      it becomes more difficult to verify eligibility based on SSA data; therefore,

    Info: 'The qualifying student must be either the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse,
      or an individual whom a taxpayer can claim as a dependent. There are many eligibility
      criteria for dependency, including relationship; specifically, the child must
      have one of the following relationships to the taxpayer: son, daughter, grandchild,
      stepchild, foster child, sibling, step-sibling, half-sibling, or the descendant
      of any of these.'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: Educational institutions send Form 1098-T to IRS reporting tuition and
      other qualified education expenses, along with some information related to the
      eligibility criteria.  However, the Form 1098-T does not report all eligibility
      criteria, and even for criteria that is reported, the data is not available
      to confirm eligibility during return processing. Furthermore, IRS lacks the
      statutory authority to disallow American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) claims
      missing Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement. Complex requirements for reporting qualifying
      educational expenses may cause discrepancies between what the taxpayer inputs
      on Form 8863, Education Credits, and what the institution enters on Form 1098-T
      and may or may not reflect taxpayer error. Conversely, because the amount of
      qualifying educational expenses reported by institutions on the Form 1098-T
      may not align with the AOTC definition, a match between the amounts on Form
      8863 and Form 1098-T does not necessarily imply a correct claim. Therefore,
      even if Form 1098-T data were available at the time of filing and even if IRS
      had congressional authority to adjust or disallow the AOTC based on information
      provided on the Form 1098-T, those data may not be sufficiently reliable for
      the IRS to act to prevent improper payments without undue burden on taxpayers.
      Another barrier is that IRS does not have congressional authority to disallow
      the claim when taxpayers claim students for more than the four-year statutory
      limit. A small segment of errors is for students that appear not to be enrolled
      at least half-time or to have exceeded four years of postsecondary education,
      although again the Form 1098-T data does not perfectly reflect the AOTC requirements.
      And an even smaller portion of errors are attributable to instances where more
      than one taxpayer claims the same student. The IRS processes returns as they
      are filed and is unaware of duplicate situations when the first return is filed,
      or which taxpayer is qualified in such a situation.
    Info: To claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), the taxpayer must have
      paid qualified education expenses for an eligible student for the first four
      years of higher education. To be eligible for the AOTC, the student must (1)
      be pursuing a degree or other recognized education credential, (2) be enrolled
      at least half time for at least one academic period beginning in the tax year,
      (3) not have finished the first four years of higher education at the beginning
      of the tax year, (4) not have claimed the AOTC or the former Hope credit for
      more than four tax years, and (5) not have a felony drug conviction at the end
      of the tax year.

      and other income sources against the return at time of filing for all taxpayers
      claiming the American Opportunity Tax Credit.
    Info: To be eligible for the AOTC, the taxpayer must have modified adjusted gross
      income (MAGI) less than $90,000 (married filing jointly $180,000), with partial
      credit given for MAGI between $80,000 and $90,000 (married joint-filers between
      $160,000 and $180,000).

    Info: The marital status of the taxpayer can affect the correct filing status
      that should be used by the taxpayer, and this in turn affects the phase-out
      ranges of income that can determine the amount of the American Opportunity Tax
      Credit (AOTC) as well as exemptions and other credits, which can also affect
      the credit amount. Marital status may also be relevant since the ability to
      claim an individual as a dependent and therefore a student, depends on their
      marital status.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: 'There is no comprehensive data source that allows IRS to determine
      if the individuals claimed for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are permanently
      and totally disabled. As outlined in IRS Publication 3966, an individual is
      permanently and totally disabled if: (a) [the individual] cannot engage in any
      substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition; and
      (b) a doctor determines that the condition has lasted or can be expected to
      last continuously for at least a year or can lead to death. Due to the IRS lacking
      a data source to verify this information, this aspect represents the fundamental
      root causes of EITC improper payments: (1) there is a statutory lack of a required
      pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny payments (refunds)
      and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs
      primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data source available at the

detail_CAP5: 'Treasury was not in compliance with PIIA for FY 2023 due to Treasury
  not adequately concluding whether the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and Pandemic
  Relief for Aviation Workers, also known as the Payroll Support Program (PSP), pandemic
  relief programs are likely to make IPs and UPs above or below the statutory threshold.


  The OIG recommendation was Treasury''s Risk and Control Group (RCG) should work
  with the Office of Capital Access (OCA) management to consider all information available
  when answering risk assessment questions to ensure adequate completion and conclusion
  of susceptibility for these program-specific risk assessments.


  The following are the actions and measurable milestones these programs have planned
  for this non-compliance criteria: OCA conducted a new risk assessment for FY24 for
  ERA. The risk assessments reconsidered previous answers and took into account factors
  beyond the four corners of the assessment template. Additionally, OCA has completed
  additional risk assessment addendums on program recipient and sub-recipients as
  coordinated by RCG.  OCA did not conduct a new risk assessment for FY24 for PSP,
  given that the program has wound down and had less than $10 million in outlays during
  FY23. However, and as noted in a memo sent to ODCFO on 9/17/24, OCA will conduct
  a payment recapture audit of PSP. OIG audits of PSP recipients have pointed to the
  inclusion of unallowable employer-side payroll taxes and corporate officer compensation
  in recipients'' sworn financial statements as causes for overpayments.


  Treasury was also found non-compliant for not reporting an improper payment error
  rate of less than 10% for the IRS Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax
  Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the refundable Premium Assistance Tax
  Credit. OIG did not provide any recommendations regarding this non-compliant criteria.
  Refundable tax credit overclaims are not the result of internal control weaknesses
  that the IRS can remediate internally, but are in fact the result of factors beyond
  the Agency''s control under the current law and existing authority.'

  lack of good faith on the part of the employee. Since the debt was established due
  to a corrected personnel action, the decision to grant or deny the waiver turns
  on fault. Fault exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is found that the
  individual knew or should have known that they received an erroneous payment.'
detail_ara2_3: 'Fiscal Service management has determined that conducting recovery
  audits for its programs would not be cost effective. Fiscal Service makes payments
  based on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies.
  Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted
  before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request
  exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.* Per OMB''s letter
  to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, the Internal
  Revenue Service (IRS) custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment Recapture
  Auditing. Treasury considers these payments negative revenue receipts, not outlays,
  and thereby exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB agreed that this
  is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are still required
  to conduct risk assessments. IRS submitted a justification to OMB in 2016 to exempt
  its non-custodial/bond programs from recovery auditing. The five-year average cost
  of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper
  payments were recaptured through recovery auditing; all funds recaptured were identified
  through normal operating processes and collected through established procedures.
  Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing, identifying, and
  recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications, and task orders. For
  its fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, including the
  Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, IRS provided a justification for determination
  that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current business practices
  (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical samples conducted
  under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification of overpayments.
  The IRS''s robust information technology platform includes several filters to monitor
  the accuracy of eligibility rules and payment certification for the various tax
  credits.* The Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective justification
  to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group can be in two
  forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered by the Federal
  Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure Payment System.
  Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made. Management has determined
  that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal recovery auditing on this
  fund group. * The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective
  justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2018. The justification was based
  on the following: The OCCs improper payment risk assessment for the five categories
  of payments (contract payments, invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll and
  benefits) has resulted in a low-risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has
  strong internal controls over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts
  ongoing internal reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions.
  The OCC performs an annual review of contract payments using analytic techniques
  to identify potentially fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC
  has very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase
  cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures.
  The most recent payment recapture audit activities required a higher cost in employee
  resources than the amount recovered. * The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective
  justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group
  have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification
  was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group
  conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management
  determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund
  group. * The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification
  for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of the justification was that BEP''s
  risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior fiscal years
  found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to .004% of the total
  disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment and post-payment
  reviews. * Treasury’s Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS)
  program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility,
  both of which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than 0.1% of the total
  program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program had completed all its awards
  to recipients and shifted to the recipient monitoring phase of the program. Since
  there was a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients,
  and a 100% recapture rate, the cost of performing a recapture audit would outweigh
  any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery
  Fund (SLFRF) identified three overpayments, which were 100% recaptured, and represented
  less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each of these three cases, recipients
  notified Treasury of the overpayments and were provided instructions on how to return
  funds to Treasury. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of control
  activities to enhance the frequency and quality of payment integrity reviews, the
  risk of improper payments is low. Therefore, the cost of performing a payment recapture
  audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment
  Program (ECIP) consulted, during the application phase, with the primary federal
  regulators for each applicant (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm
  that it was eligible to receive funding. The underwriting process was conducted
  in coordination with teams of community development finance and financial institutions
  and external financial advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve
  each investment decision, based on established procedures which incorporated risk
  management controls and included multiple layers of review. Since the program has
  implemented multiple levels of review involving multiple outside and independent
  assessments, the risk of improper payments is low and the potential benefit of conducting
  a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. * Treasury’s
  Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF) has maintained its own listing
  and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk
  of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of internal/quality
  controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment integrity review, the
  risk of improper payments is low. * Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative
  (SSBCI) program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts
  post-approval procedures through SSBCI''s  Compliance Program. The application process
  includes checks to validate identity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs
  for the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant is
  not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing
  improper payments.  * For the Capital Projects Fund (CPF), Emergency Rental Assistance
  (ERA), and Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), Treasury has implemented multiple levels
  of control activities including: (1) reviews of single audit reports which facilitates
  the identification and prevention of costs that may ultimately result in improper
  payments if not remedied;  and (2) a standardized, cross-program compliance program
  that includes established compliance testing procedures as well as recipient self-identified
  reporting, through which improper payments are identified and documented in accordance
  with non-compliance remediation procedures and remediation action taken. * The Special
  Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) has an established inter-agency
  agreement and service level agreement in place with the Treasury''s Administrative
  Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support
  services. As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is
  not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance
  on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for financial
  reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover
  improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and
  implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented,
  including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, to prevent
  and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since there are
  payment recovery processes included within the policies and multiple levels of review
  involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks of improper payments
  are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit
  is minimal and would be duplicative.  Therefore, the cost of performing a payment
  recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * The Treasury Executive Office
  of Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) has analyzed several factors and reviewed several current
  procedures for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to determine if implementation of payment
  recapture auditing is cost effective These include: a low risk assessment determination,
  EOAF staff reviews monthly payments for accuracy, obligations are established at
  a very low detail levels to provide easier control and review of payment activity,
  the nature of the program payments being made to state and local law enforcement
  agencies minimizes improper payments, and improper payment review yielded no improper
  payment issues. Therefore, EOAF has determined the additional cost for staff and
  resources to conduct payment recapture audits would not be cost effective. * The
  Office of DC Pensions’ (ODCP) largest payment area is benefits and has a robust
  multi-tier quality review program that includes in-depth annuitant case review as
  a part of its normal course of business. Through ODCP''s quality review program,
  significant numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are
  detected, benefit payments are corrected and debt collection activities begin, as
  applicable. In addition, all contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include
  a second level review prior to payment submission.  As such, ODCP had determined
  that a payment recapture audit is not cost effective as it is very unlikely that
  any additional overpayments would be identified, i.e., the cost would exceed the
  benefit.'

detail_exs1: "Treasury programs in phase 1 are required to complete a PIIA risk assessment\
  \ once every three years. The years in between risk assessments, we require programs\
  \ to complete a certification which states there has been no major changes to program\
  \ funding or legislation that could impact the risk of improper payments. In FY\
  \ 24, 34 programs completed a risk assessment. Of these 34 risk assessments, 31\
  \ were found not susceptible to significant improper payments and three were found\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments. The three programs that were found\
  \ susceptible to significant improper payments were the Emergency Rental Assistance\
  \ (ERA), Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) US Coronavirus Payments, and IRS US Coronavirus\
  \ Refundable Credits. These three COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, along with\
  \ two other COVID-19 pandemic relief program, IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit\
  \ and Air Carrier Payroll Support Programs (PSP), also known as Pandemic Relief\
  \ for Aviation Workers, were determined to be susceptible to improper payments in\
  \ previous years. However, in August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term\
  \ nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments,\
  \ assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment\
  \ errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of\
  \ resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, Treasury decided\
  \ it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial\
  \ Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. These programs remain in the risk assessment\
  \ rotation.\n\nTreasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix\
  \ C, for four refundable tax credits (RTCs)—the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),\
  \ American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and\
  \ net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). \n\nThe root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC,\
  \ ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal control deficiencies and,\
  \ as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly tools to in effort to lower\
  \ the error rate. These tools include training, such as the nationwide tax forum,\
  \ due diligence training module and webinars, cross enterprise sharing with other\
  \ Federal agencies, and change processes such as hosting annual Dependent Database\
  \ meetings with stakeholders to adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters\
  \ for audit selection of returns claiming the RTCs and identifying improvement opportunities\
  \ for the filing season. Deployment of enforcement tools has had minimal impact\
  \ on lowering the error rate. The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its\
  \ improper payment rate for these RTC programs to less than 10 percent.\n\nTreasury\
  \ was found non-compliant with 2 of the 10 PIIA reporting requirements for FY23.\
  \ Specifically, Treasury did not adequately conclude whether programs are likely\
  \ to make Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs) above or below the\
  \ statutory threshold for the ERA and PSP pandemic relief programs; and did not\
  \ comply with the requirement to report an improper payment rate of less than 10\
  \ percent for four the IRS RTC programs mentioned above (EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and Net\
  \ PTC). Treasury complied with the remaining eight PIIA requirements. Treasury corrective\
  \ action plans to bring ERA and PSP into compliance by May 2025. While the improper\
  \ payment rates did decrease in EITC, AOTC, and ACTC, it remains a significant challenge\

  1. Recommends that Treasury''s Risk and Control Group (RCG) work with the Office
  of Capital Access (OCA) management to consider all information available when answering
  risk assessment questions to ensure adequate completion and conclusion of susceptibility
  for these program-specific risk assessments.

  2. Recommends Treasury''s RCG require OCA management to conduct and provide an updated
  analysis and justification memo that takes into consideration known and likely improper
  payments made to recipients at all levels as reflected in audits and other information,
  that might impact its conclusion on whether payment recapture audits are cost-effective
  for its pandemic relief programs.

  3. Recommends Treasury''s RCG emphasize the requirement that Components review for
  completeness and accuracy the tracking sheet used to determine the fund groups that
  have expended over $1,000,000 and would therefore need to provide evidence of either
  a payment recapture audit or a justification memo by Treasury''s due dates. Further,
  RCG should complete a thorough review of the tracking sheets submitted by Components
  for completeness and accuracy.

  4. Recommends Treasury''s RCG works with all components to accurately complete and
  review the program-specific risk assessments.'
