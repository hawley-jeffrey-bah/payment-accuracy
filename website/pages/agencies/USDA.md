      Human error is the primary contributing factor for aggregation errors that occur
      when, in the process of submitting claims for reimbursement, incorrect meal
      counts are recorded or transmitted from schools to School Food Authorities (SFAs),
      from SFAs to State Agencies (SAs), or from SAs to the Food and Nutrition Service.
    Info: National School Lunch Program (NSLP) improper payments stemming from failure
      to access data in the Financial category largely relate to errors that occur
      when claims for reimbursement are prepared prior to submission to the State
      Agency (SA). Meal counts from individual points of service are consolidated
      at individual schools. Individual school meal counts are submitted to School
      Food Authorities (SFAs), which are then consolidated again before a claim for
      reimbursement is submitted from SFAs to SAs. Aggregation error occurs when incorrect
      meal counts are recorded, transmitted, or aggregated at any level (school, SFAs).
      SAs then report aggregated claims data to Food and Nutrition Service NSLP.

      take full advantage of data matching to limit reliance on self-reported income.
      The remaining applicant households do not exist on other accessible or current
      databases for matching.
    Info: The Household Size eligibility criteria for the National School Lunch Program
      (NSLP) contributes to improper payments because the number of household members
      is required information on an application for benefits and is necessary to determine
      eligibility for program benefits. Households must self-report information about
      Household Size on applications that are submitted to local school districts,
      and districts utilize that information to determine household eligibility for
      school meals. Program staff must consider the self-reported information on Household
      Size in combination with the household income to determine eligibility for program

      income, and anticipated income that is reasonably certain. Earned income includes
      salary, wages, and self-employment income and unearned income can come from
      a variety of sources including Social Security Insurance (SSI), Retirement,
      Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI), and pension plans. Resources includes

  - Barriers: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's primary barrier to improving
      payment accuracy related to household composition is that no data match exists
      to validate a household's composition or whether mandatory household members
      are reported and accounted for accurately. Verification must come from the household
      and collateral contacts that know the circumstances of the household.
    Info: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) rules for household composition
      can be found in regulation at 7 CFR 273.1. A SNAP household generally consists
      of an individual living alone; an individual living with others but purchasing
      and preparing food separate and apart from others; and a group of individuals
      living together that purchase and prepare food together. Certain household members
      must be considered the same household, regardless of whether they purchase or
      prepare food together or apart including spouses, a person under 22 years old
      living with their natural or adoptive parents, and a child under 18 who lives

      member or apply for one before certification. If individuals have more than
      one number, all numbers shall be required. Refusal or failure without good cause

      the State in which it files an application for participation. The State agency
      may also require a household to file an application for participation in a specified
      project area (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2) or office within the State. No individual
      may participate as a member of more than one household or in more than one project

  - Barriers: "RMA does not have any barriers regarding affiliation eligibility.\n\
      \ \nThe Federal Crop Insurance program is a multi-billion-dollar program that\
      \ consists of a public-private partnership.  Because of the immensity of the\
      \ program, human error is inevitable, therefore causing a barrier prohibiting\
      \ the prevention of improper payments.  Furthermore, continuous changes to current\
      \ policies and procedures, the introduction of new policies and procedures,\
      \ and events outside our control that impact our program (i.e., natural disasters)\
      \ all present additional barriers in improper payment prevention.  Given these\
      \ challenges, RMA has continuously maintained a tolerable error rate for multiple\
      \ years.\n"
    Info: "RMA recorded all overpayments and underpayments under Affiliation. \n\n\
      Policyholder's eligibility is not a cause of RMAs overpayments and underpayments.\
      \  RMA's overpayments and underpayments are the result of eligible policyholder's\
      \ mis certifying the information used to establish their policy (i.e., acres,\
      \ share, production, etc.), not being able to support their certifications (i.e.,\
      \ unacceptable supporting documentation, not having supporting documentation,\
      \ etc.), or processing/administrative type errors (i.e., advertent keying errors,\
      \ calculation errors, procedural errors, etc.).  \n"

  \ Agency (FSA) Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters, (3) Livestock Forage Disaster\
  \ Program, and (4) Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program were found to be\
  \ non-compliant with criteria 6 which requires reporting an improper payment estimate\
  \ of less than 10 percent. \n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) recommended\
  \ that SNAP provide information on paymentaccuracy.gov about actions it will take\
  \ to come into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) requirement.\
  \ Specifically, the OIG recommended that SNAP establish measurable milestones to\
  \ comply with PIIA requirements to report an improper payment rate of 10 percent\
  \ or less. To that end, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has identified the\
  \ SNAP improper payment rate target as 11 percent for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 performance,\
  \ 10.5 percent for FY 2025 performance, and 10 percent for FY 2026 performance.\
  \ To achieve these targets, FNS will continue to conduct training for State agencies\
  \ on an ongoing basis and will provide additional tools to conduct root cause analysis\
  \ and identify trends in error rate data. In FY 2025, FNS will facilitate two meetings\
  \ focused on assisting States in determining their root causes of error and corrective\
  \ actions to address them. In FY 2026, FNS will launch a new, modernized payment\
  \ accuracy data management system, which will include enhanced data analytics features\
  \ to assist State agencies in better utilizing their data for root cause analysis\
  \ and corrective action planning.\n\nDuring FY 2025, FSA  FSA submitted a plan to\
  \ Congress, describing detailed actions the agency will take to bring the program\
  \ into compliance.  Planned Actions include:\n\n(1) Consolidating the program district\
  \ director review process into the FSA Internal Review Document and Tracking System\
  \ to ensure reviews are being completed timely and results are monitored and evaluated\
  \ to ensure ECP-Disaster policies are being followed.  \n\n(2) Establish additional\
  \ webinar/virtual training sessions as needed to ensure state office staff are aware\
  \ of updated policy requirements and clarifications on the requirements.  \n\n(3)\
  \ Implement a new software platform, new methods for computing payments using payment\
  \ scenarios, and improve checklists for conducting internal reviews throughout the\

  and post-payment. The number of DNP search activities reached over 100% increase
  for FY 2024 (from 5,068 to 10,185). The Department's active users increased by approximately
  88% from 1,869 in FY 2023 to 3,509 in FY 2024.
detail_exs1: 'For Fiscal Year 2024, eight mission areas (and several staff offices)
  within USDA had a total of 161 programs that were either in Phase 1 or Phase 2 category.
  The total number of programs has not changed from the previous fiscal year 2023.
  Specifically, 100 programs were categorized in Phase 1; a total of 12 programs were
  categorized in Phase 2 and 49 programs had outlays less than $10M. This was a slight
  decrease in the number of Phase 1 programs and Phase 2 programs from FY2023.


  Also, USDA had four High-Priority Programs (FNS: NSLP, SBP; SNAP and RMA/FCIC).
  Corrective action plans and milestones have been developed and implemented to reduce
  the improper payments for each program. During FY2024, USDA continues to recover
  funds that were determined improper. There are instances when the collection of
  these funds is not completely recovered in the same fiscal year that it was identified.
  The improper payment estimates, and error rates have shown a decrease for several
  USDA programs.'

  proposal for submission to the OMB Director. Lastly, there were two recommendations
  related to the quality of USDA's Improper Payment Reporting (1) FNS must ensure
  proper reporting and classification of its CACFP and (2) the OCFO and responsible
  program officials must review supporting documentation to verify the accuracy and
  completeness of reported information prior to publication.
