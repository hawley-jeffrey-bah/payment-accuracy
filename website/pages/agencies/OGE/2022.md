detail_dpa5: OGE uses the Do Not Pay Initiative as a service provided by our Shared
  Service Provider for Financial Management - Bureau of Fiscal Services/ARC.  Reviews
  of payments are routinely conducted and appropriate reports run to determine payment
  accuracy.  These reports and audits are provided to OGE on a monthly basis.  This
  process works well and no improper payments have been paid.
detail_exs1: OGE does not currently have any programs with annual outlays over $10M
  and therefore under PIIA does not have any programs that are likely to be susceptible
  to significant improper payments.  All payments are processed through several layers
  of review at the agency and shared service provider level for accuracy as well as
  monthly audits of payments made.
