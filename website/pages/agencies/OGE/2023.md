detail_ara2_3: OGE's payments are so small in most cases that conducting audit activity
  to determine and resolve the potential improper payment would likely be much more
  than the payment made.  With the internal controls OGE has in place and the small
  number and amounts of payments, no improper payments have yet to be identified and
  negate the need to conduct recovery audits.
detail_ara2_3_2: Recovery Audits are not cost effective for any OGE programs.

detail_dpa5: OGE uses the Do Not Pay Initiative to review payment eligibility for
  purposes of identifying and preventing improper payments as well as a check and
  balance to ensure no improper payments are being made.  OGE, utilizes its Shared
  Service Financial Management Services provider, Bureau of Fiscal Services to review
  all payments against payment eligibility and Do Not Pay databases.  OGE receives
  monthly reports on improper payments for review and action if necessary.  In FY2023
  OGE has not been notified of an improper payment identified for any amount. As such
  a reduction of improper payments cannot be realized under this process.  OGE's use
  of DNP is very useful along with other internal controls in ensuring that only eligible
  entities receive federal funds.
detail_exs1: The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is compliant with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). OGE does not currently have any programs
  with annual outlays over $10M and therefore under PIIA does not have any programs
  that are susceptible to significant improper payments.  OGE maintains payment integrity
  through internal controls, a robust pre-payment review process and continuous monitoring
  by several review layers within OGE.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: OGE does not have an OIG, as such no recommendations for actions to
  further improve prevention and reduction of IP and UPs. Further OGE does not have
  any programs reporting above the statutory threshold.
