detail_agy1: OGE is a very small agency with limited resources. Payment to all service
  providers is closely monitored and reviewed by several distinct review levels both
  internal to OGE and external via our financial management shared service provider.
  Any questionable invoice is thoroughly reviewed and validated for accuracy prior
  to payment.

detail_ara2_3: OGE has determined that it is not cost effective to conduct recovery
  audits in certain programs. OGE has no programs that meet PIAA criteria and agency
  payments are normally so small that conducting audit activity to determine and resolve
  a potential improper payment would likely cost much more in time and effort than
  the overpayment.  With the extensive internal controls both at OGE and BFS and the
  small number and amounts of payments made, no improper payments have been identified
  or made negating the need to conduct recovery audits. Recovery audits are not cost
  effective for OGE.
detail_ara2_3_2: OGE has no programs that meet PIAA criteria to conduct recovery audits.

detail_dpa5: OGE uses the Do Not Pay Initiative as a check and balance to ensure no
  improper payments are being made in coordination with it Shared Service Financial
  Management Services provider, the Bureau of Fiscal Service. Payment Activity reports
  are routinely reviewed for payment eligibility and against Do Not Pay databases
  to ensure proper payments. The Do Not Pay Initiative validates OGE's proper payment
  integrity.  OGE has not been notified of any improper payments during the reporting
  period, as such it can be assumed that the Do Not Pay Initiative has had a positive
  impact on reducing Improper Payments.
detail_exs1: The U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is compliant with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). OGE does not currently have any programs
  with annual outlays over $10M. Therefore, under PIIA, OGE does not have any programs
  that are susceptible to significant improper payments.  OGE maintains proper payment
  integrity with multiple levels of pre-payment internal controls and constant monitoring
  of payment activities.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: OGE does not have an OIG, as such no recommendations for actions to
  further improve prevention and reduction of Improper Payments and Unknown Payments.
