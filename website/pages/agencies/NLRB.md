  In the long run, the Do Not Pay initiative will help reduce the improper payments.
detail_exs1: 'The PIIA (Payment Integrity and Information Act) amends government-wide
  improper payment reporting requirements by repealing and replacing the Improper
  Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery
  Act of 2010 (IPERA), the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2012
  (IPERIA), and the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics (FRDAA).


  The NLRB is required by the PIIA to assess the disbursement process and estimate
  the amount of improper payments every three years. The NLRB’s latest IPIA assessment
  and review performed by an independent consultant in FY 2022 concluded that the
  NLRB program and activities were at a low risk for improper payments.


  For FY 2024, NLRB processed $301,528,874 in disbursements which included payroll
  and benefits of $235,107,439 and travel of $1,216,528. In addition, the NLRB paid
  $65,204,907 to vendors which accounted for 22 percent of the total disbursements.


  The NLRB’s independent review evaluated the procedures in the Agency’s payment and
  disbursement processes. It also tested and assessed the design and effectiveness
  of internal controls. Given these controls, the IPIA assessment found no improper
  payment in the testing and found that the estimated improper payments to be within
  the thresholds defined by IPIA. Thus, improper payments for the NLRB’s programs
  did not exceed $10 million and 1.5 percent of the program total expenditures or
  $100 million of the total program expenditures. The Agency estimates the improper
  payments rate to be at most 1.5 percent and the improper payment amount to be no
  more than $4,522,933. Therefore, the NLRB has effective procedures and controls
  in place for its payment and disbursement processes. The NLRB has reasonable assurance
  that controls over financial and non-financial operations are sufficient. No additional
  reporting requirements are necessary.
