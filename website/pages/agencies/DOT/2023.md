- Program_Name: Federal Highway Administration Highway Planning and Construction
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The FHWA Highway Planning and Construction Program relies on the internal
      controls and financial systems of State and Local governments to effectively
      administer program funds. The FHWA is tasked with ensuring highway projects
      approved for Federal funding are consistent with applicable laws, regulations
      and policies. State and Local governments act on behalf of FHWA by taking the
      responsibilities for oversight and project development, as well as administering
      the construction and inspection of many Highway Planning and Construction projects.
      While FHWA and States are jointly responsible for the stewardship of Federal
      funds, much of the authority for administering the program, to include implementing
      effective internal controls and payment accuracy, falls to the grant recipient.
    Info: FHWA Highway Planning and Construction overpayments and underpayment represent
      costs that are the responsibility of State and Local governments.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: FTA Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief activities rely on
      the internal controls and financial systems of transit authorities to effectively
      administer program funds. FTA is tasked with ensuring transit projects approved
      for Federal funding are consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies.
      Transit authorities act on behalf of FTA by taking the responsibilities to oversee
      capital, operating, and other expenses generally eligible under those programs
      to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19. While FTA and transit authorities
      are jointly responsible for the stewardship of Federal funds, much of the authority
      for administering the program, to include implementing effective internal controls
      and payment accuracy, falls to the grant recipient.
    Info: FTA Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief overpayments represent
      costs that are the responsibility of State, Local governments or transit authorities.

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The Department enhanced its methodology to assess the fraud
    risk factor in FY 2023. We added flexibility that enables DOT programs and activities
    to tailor the fraud risk factor by fraud schemes and other program-specific characteristics.
    The new approach encourages program officials to gain a better understanding of
    their vulnerabilities by 'thinking like a fraudster.' The remaining risk factors
    for our qualitative improper payment risk assessment remained the same as prior
    years.

detail_arp17: Grant payments continue to represent the greatest proportion of overpayments
  identified through the recovery audit. DOT attributes the cause for grant-related
  overpayments to administrative errors made by entities external to the Department.
  In particular, administrative errors made by grant recipients when seeking reimbursement
  from COVID relief funding sources for costs incurred prior to pandemic. Since FY
  2021, DOT has sought to conduct quantitative improper payment risk assessments (Phase
  1) of COVID relief payments along with our annual estimates (Phase 2). The reviews
  reinforce DOT program oversight controls over relief funds administered by grant
  recipients and provide targeted actions for identified errors. The recovery audit
  provides an additional layer of detective controls to assess and confirm whether
  DOT’s improper payments remain within tolerable ranges.

detail_dpa5: 'An important part of the Department’s program integrity efforts is integrating
  Treasury Department’s Do Not Pay (DNP) Business Center into our existing processes.
  DOT utilizes the DNP Business Center to perform online searches, screen payments
  against the DNP databases, and augment DOT’s Payment Integrity Center capabilities.


  DNP specifically helps the Department prevent improper payments by matching all
  of our payments against the death data sources on a daily basis.  For FY 2023, DNP
  identified 5 DOT payments that matched against the death data sources amounting
  to approximately $6,000.  Even though all FY 2023 matches were proper payments,
  the information enabled DOT staff to take proactive measures and reduce repeat occurrences.


  Overall, the Department has neither identified a material amount nor realized a
  material reduction of improper payments attributable to the implementing the DNP
  capabilities. Our DNP implementation has proven, however, that DOT has robust and
  effective internal controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal
  funds.'
detail_exs1: "The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recognizes the importance\
  \ of maintaining effective internal controls to ensure proper payments as evidenced\
  \ by the 30% reduction of estimated improper payments (IP) compared to last fiscal\
  \ year, $756 million of estimated IPs in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 compared to $530\
  \ million in FY 2023. Common characteristics of DOT’s programs susceptible to significant\
  \ IPs are that both programs are administered by grant recipients, typically a State\
  \ DOT or local transit authority, and that IPs are outside of our control when the\
  \ grant recipients make administrative errors. Whereas grant recipients are responsible\
  \ for the administration of federal assistance, DOT is responsible, primarily through\
  \ its division and regional offices, for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements\
  \ and proper use of Federal funds. The IP sampling and estimation process is an\
  \ example of one method DOT utilizes to assess grant recipient compliance with Federal\
  \ requirements and to identify emerging causes of payment integrity risk.\n\nDOT\
  \ prioritizes efforts to identify and reduce improper payments through robust internal\
  \ control programs by establishing aggressive goals. Our reduction target aligns\
  \ with the Organizational Excellence strategic objective within the Department's\
  \ FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan to ensure responsible and transparent stewardship\
  \ public resources. The plan includes a performance goal to achieve a 99% payment\
  \ accuracy rate to demonstrate robust internal controls at both the Federal and\
  \ grant recipient levels. For FY 2023, the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway\
  \ Planning and Construction Plan program achieved a payment accuracy rate of 99.95%\
  \ and the Federal Transit Administration’s Transit Infrastructure Grant – COVID\
  \ Relief Funds reported a rate of 98.43%. \n\nTraining and maintaining strong partnerships\
  \ with our grant recipients are essential to reducing DOT’s IPs over time. While\
  \ robust, the internal control systems and structures of our grant recipients across\
  \ the Nation must constantly evolve to meet changing Federal statutory and regulatory\
  \ requirements. For example, the statutory COVID relief funding requirements established\
  \ a date, January 20, 2020, for cost eligibility. While well defined, the date is\
  \ quite arbitrary when applied to a grant recipient payroll system that processes\
  \ retroactive pay adjustments or reimbursement processes that bundle newly eligible\
  \ costs from a wide range of dates. Hence, continued collaboration and communication\
  \ between DOT and our State and Local partners is a necessity to ensure compliance\
  \ with Federal requirements including the accuracy of payment requests. \n\nIn addition\
  \ to estimating IPs, the Department performed over 30 IP risk assessments of its\
  \ programs, conducted a payment recovery audit, analyzed confirmed fraud cases,\
  \ and screened payments against the Do Not Pay databases. DOT’s Payment Integrity\
  \ Center is responsible for coordinating IP reviews, reporting results, and monitoring\
  \ the progress of corrective actions in accordance with Payment Integrity Information\
  \ Act of 2019 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123 Appendix C, Requirements\
  \ for Payment Integrity Improvement. Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity\
  \ Center performed the recovery audit. We take pride in reducing our estimated IPs\
  \ in FY 2023 and remain committed to strengthening our payment processing controls\
  \ going forward."

  recommendations made in prior years and did not provide new recommendations to further
  improve prevention and reduction of improper payments.
detail_raa8: 'Yes'
detail_raa9: The Department enhanced its methodology to assess the fraud risk factor
  in FY 2023. We added flexibility that enables DOT programs and activities to tailor
  the fraud risk factor by fraud schemes and other program-specific characteristics.
  The new approach encourages program officials to gain a better understanding of
  their vulnerabilities by 'thinking like a fraudster.' The remaining risk factors
  for our qualitative improper payment risk assessment remained the same as prior
  years.
