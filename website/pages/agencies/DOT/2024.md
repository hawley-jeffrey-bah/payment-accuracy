- Program_Name: Federal Highway Administration Highway Planning and Construction
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The FHWA Highway Planning and Construction Program relies on the internal
      controls and financial systems of State and Local governments to effectively
      administer program funds. The FHWA is tasked with ensuring highway projects
      approved for Federal funding are consistent with applicable laws, regulations
      and policies. State and Local governments have the responsibility for oversight
      and project development, as well as administering the construction and inspection
      of many Highway Planning and Construction projects. While FHWA and States are
      jointly responsible for the stewardship of Federal funds, much of the authority
      for administering the program, to include implementing effective internal controls
      and payment accuracy, falls to the grant recipient.
    Info: FHWA Highway Planning and Construction overpayments represent costs that
      are the responsibility of State and Local governments.

  Themes:
  - Barriers: FTA Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief activities rely on
      the internal controls and financial systems of transit authorities to effectively
      administer program funds. FTA is tasked with ensuring transit projects approved
      for Federal funding are consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies.
      Transit authorities have the responsibility to oversee capital, operating, and
      other expenses generally eligible under those programs to prevent, prepare for,
      and respond to COVID-19. While FTA and transit authorities are jointly responsible
      for the stewardship of Federal funds, much of the responsibility for administering
      the program, to include implementing effective internal controls and payment
      accuracy, falls to the grant recipient.
    Info: FTA Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief overpayments represent
      costs that are the responsibility of State, Local governments or transit authorities.

detail_ara2_1: Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed the
  recovery audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2023 through March 2024.
  DOT considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal year 2024 audit to
  be recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s service provider, typically
  recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly from the payee, by offsetting
  a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt to the Department of Treasury’s
  Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover overpayments directly from the payees.
  In fiscal year 2024, recaptured overpayments resulting from DOT errors were returned
  to the program or activity’s original purpose.

detail_arp17: Grant payments continue to represent the greatest proportion of overpayments
  identified through the recovery audit. DOT attributes the cause for grant-related
  overpayments to administrative errors made by entities external to the Department.
  In particular, administrative errors made by grant recipients identified when closing
  grant agreements funded by COVID relief sources. Since FY 2021, DOT has sought to
  conduct quantitative improper payment risk assessments (Phase 1) of COVID relief
  payments along with our annual estimates (Phase 2). The reviews reinforce DOT program
  oversight controls over relief funds administered by grant recipients and provide
  targeted actions for identified errors. The recovery audit provides an additional
  layer of detective controls to assess and confirm whether DOT’s improper payments
  remain within tolerable ranges.

detail_dpa5: 'An important part of the Department’s program integrity efforts is integrating
  Treasury Department’s Do Not Pay (DNP) Business Center into our existing processes.
  DOT utilizes the DNP Business Center to perform online searches, screen payments
  against the DNP databases, and augment DOT’s Payment Integrity Center capabilities.


  DNP specifically helps the Department prevent improper payments by matching all
  of our payments against the death data sources on a daily basis.  In addition, we
  expanded our DNP online search capabilities during FY 2024 to all available data
  sources. Several DOT program managers reached out to search grant recipients against
  DNP data sources as another layer of verification and validation.  For FY 2024,
  DNP identified 14 DOT payments that matched against the death data sources amounting
  to approximately $12,224.76. Even though all FY 2024 matches were proper payments,
  the information enabled DOT staff to take proactive measures and reduce repeat occurrences.


  Overall, the Department has neither identified a material amount nor realized a
  material reduction of improper payments attributable to our evolving DNP capabilities.
  Our DNP implementation has proven, however, that DOT has robust and effective internal
  controls over ensuring that eligible entities receive Federal funds.'
detail_exs1: "The Department of Transportation (DOT) prioritizes payment integrity\
  \ efforts and recognizes the importance of maintaining effective internal controls\
  \ to ensure proper payments. Safeguarding DOT’s assets and resources reinforces\
  \ the Department’s mission: To deliver the world’s leading transportation system,\
  \ serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable,\
  \ and equitable movement of people and goods. \n\nDOT is proud to report a Fiscal\
  \ Year (FY) 2024 payment accuracy rate of 98.10% that compares favorably to the\
  \ most recent Federal-wide payment accuracy rate of 94.58% reported in FY 2023.\
  \ The FY 2024 payment accuracy rate was below our reduction target and decreased\
  \ slightly when compared to the prior year rate of 99.3%. Our reduction target aligns\
  \ with the Organizational Excellence strategic objective within the Department's\
  \ FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan to ensure responsible and transparent stewardship\
  \ of public resources. The plan includes an aggressive performance goal to achieve\
  \ a 99% payment accuracy rate to demonstrate robust internal controls at both the\
  \ Federal and grant recipient levels. \n\nFor FY 2024 phase 2 programs, the Federal\
  \ Highway Administration’s Highway Planning and Construction achieved a payment\
  \ accuracy rate of 98.04% and the Federal Transit Administration’s Transit Infrastructure\
  \ Grant – Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID) Relief Funds achieved a rate of 98.44%.\
  \ Both payment accuracy rates are below our 99% performance goal; yet remain within\
  \ the upper and lower bounds of their historical estimates. Therefore, we view the\
  \ rates for both programs to be within their historical statistical ranges and will\
  \ closely monitor them against FY 2025 results to determine if any changes represent\
  \ a trend that require more aggressive corrective action. \n\nCommon characteristics\
  \ of DOT’s programs susceptible to significant improper payments (IPs) are that\
  \ both programs are administered by grant recipients, typically a State DOT or local\
  \ transit authority, and that IPs are outside of our control when the grant recipients\
  \ make administrative errors. Whereas grant recipients are responsible for the administration\
  \ of federal assistance, DOT is responsible, primarily through its division and\
  \ regional offices, for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and proper\
  \ use of Federal funds. The IP sampling and estimation process is an example of\
  \ one method DOT utilizes to assess grant recipient compliance with Federal requirements\
  \ and to identify emerging causes of payment integrity risk. During FY 2024, DOT’s\
  \ Inspector General (OIG) concluded that our FY 2023 reports were compliant with\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements as prescribed by\
  \ the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OIG will issue a report in FY 2025\
  \ with a determination on whether DOT’s FY 2024 reports were compliant with PIIA\
  \ requirements.  \n\nTraining and maintaining strong partnerships with our grant\
  \ recipients are essential to reducing DOT’s IPs over time. DOT Operating Administrations\
  \ work with grant recipients to: improve project documentation, contractual adherence,\
  \ adherence of Federal regulation requirements, invoice verification, payment processes,\
  \ and address training deficiencies as applicable for each IP. While robust, the\
  \ internal control systems and structures of our grant recipients across the Nation\
  \ must constantly evolve to meet changing Federal statutory and regulatory requirements.\
  \ For example, the statutory COVID relief funding requirements established a date,\
  \ January 20, 2020, for cost eligibility. While well defined, the date is quite\
  \ arbitrary when applied to a grant recipient financial management systems that\
  \ process retroactive pay adjustments or bundle newly eligible costs for reimbursement\
  \ from a wide range of dates. Hence, continued collaboration and communication between\
  \ DOT and our State and Local partners is a necessity to ensure compliance with\
  \ Federal requirements including the accuracy of payment requests.\n\nDOT’s Payment\
  \ Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating improper payment reviews, reporting\
  \ results, and monitoring the progress of corrective actions in accordance with\
  \ PIIA, OMB Circular No. A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement,\
  \ and OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements. The Integrity Center’s\
  \ trend analysis of overall disbursements by Treasury code and monitoring of DOT\
  \ spending reports identifies and validates new, as well as significant payment\
  \ changes to existing programs. Annually, the Integrity Center performs a Department-wide\
  \ payment analysis based on monthly Treasury statements (MTS). The Integrity Center\
  \ also monitors spending reports available to the public on DOT’s webpage. Two publicly\
  \ available reports include the: USDOT COVID-19 Relief Funding and Bipartisan Infrastructure\
  \ Law (BIL) Funding Status report. \n\nIn addition to monitoring program spending\
  \ and estimating IPs for 2 programs, the Department: performed an IP risk assessment,\
  \ conducted a payment recovery audit, monitored the progress of corrective actions,\
  \ analyzed confirmed fraud cases, and screened payments against the Do Not Pay databases.\
  \ DOT phase 1 programs must perform an IP risk assessment at a minimum once every\
  \ three years unless there is a program or funding change. Most of DOT’s programs\
  \ completed triennial risk assessment cycle during FY 2023 with 1 program assessed\
  \ in FY 2024 as not susceptible to significant improper payments. For FY 2025, the\
  \ DOT Payment Integrity Center plans perform annual requirements, monitor implementation\
  \ of corrective actions developed in FY 2024, and report IP estimates for its 2\
  \ programs that continue to be susceptible to significant improper payments. We\
  \ take pride in our payment integrity efforts and remain committed to strengthening\
  \ our payment processing controls going forward."
