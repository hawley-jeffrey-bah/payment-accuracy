detail_ara2_1: GSA's Recovery Audit contractor uses lease contracts and other lease
  documents to develop a detailed monthly rental schedule from lease commencement
  to most recent rent payment. This schedule is then compared to actual payments by
  month to determine if there are any discrepancies. If discrepancies are discovered,
  they are quantified and identified as to the nature and origin. A review of real
  estate tax adjustments is also done for each lease. Tax adjustments are reviewed
  for accuracy on the part of the Lessor’s submission of tax bills.
detail_ara2_2: GSA's recovery audit efforts currently target PBS’ “rental of space”,
  a known area prone to improper payments. One common issue that causes an improper
  payment to be not collectable is that when a building is sold or ownership is transferred,
  the entity GSA has a claim against may be dissolved. It's not unusual for companies
  to dissolve their LLCs after a building sale or transfer, making recovery of funds
  difficult. Additionally, GSA has encountered cases where companies declare bankruptcy.
  In these situations, claims are ranked in order of priority, and GSA’s claims often
  receive low priority among the creditors.

detail_arp17: "Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed\
  \ to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord pays\
  \ the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage\
  \ occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the GSA\
  \ annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid through\
  \ rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are less than\
  \ the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.  Recoveries\
  \ arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios by not sending\
  \ GSA the appropriate tax bills.    \n\nResolution 1: GSA has established agencywide\
  \ procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord does not\
  \ send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper payments\
  \ in this area in the last 4 years.\n\nCondition 2: There are several variables\
  \ that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker commission\
  \ credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on a preceding lease,\
  \ etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered in the billing system\
  \ (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system to the payment system\
  \ (Pegasys).\n\nResolution 2: Checklists have been developed in GSA's Regions to\
  \ ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system (REXUS).  Also, in\
  \ July of 2020, the REXUS to Pegasys interface automatically transfers data from\
  \ REXUS to Pegasys so that it is no longer a manual process of entering credit data\
  \ for leases into Pegasys which has helped reduce errors."

  system daily. Very few matches are returned. Most matches are for salary payments
  and are false positives (there is a valid reason for the payment). The Financial
  Management Systems Operations and Maintenance Division sends the Pegasys vendor
  table to the Do Not Pay portal on the 10th of each month. The matches are researched
  in Pegasys to verify that the vendor has been marked "Debarred" or "Inactive". The
  Debarment flag is interfaced from SAM. The Inactive flag is manually adjusted in
  Pegasys if the Debarment has not yet interfaced into Pegasys or if a vendor on the
  Death Master List is identified. The Do Not Pay initiative continues to help reduce
  improper payments at GSA.
detail_exs1: 'GSA was found to be compliant in the most recent OIG Annual Compliance
  Review. Currently, GSA doesn''t have any programs in Phase 2.  GSA completed 22
  risk assessments in FY24.  All of the risk assessments found that the programs were
  not likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments.


  GSA achieves and maintains compliance using multiple methods which includes monitoring
  all GSA programs through Data Act reporting, ongoing risk assessments, internal
  control reviews, assurance statements, researching incidents of reported improper
  payments, monitoring claims activities, and ongoing audit recovery activities.  In
  addition, GSA continued recovery audit activities with ongoing audits of rental
  of space activities and continues to track claims related to improper payments.  Finally,
  GSA continues to analyze and expand audit recovery areas when warranted based on
  evidence found during the course of the year.'
