detail_ara2_3: "We have a robust, multi-faceted review process in place that is an\
  \ effective approach for evaluating payment accuracy in the RRA and RUIA programs\
  \ and identifying and preventing improper payments. The RRB notified OMB of our\
  \ approach in August 2011.   Taken as a whole, our full range of current activities\
  \ constitutes an effective alternative to a formal payment recapture program. However,\
  \ despite the agency’s best efforts to prevent improper payments, some will always\
  \ occur, due to lack of timely information, etc. The agency is diligent in its recovery\
  \ efforts for overpayments.  \n\nThe agency conducts numerous quality assurance\
  \ reviews focused on detecting improper payments in the vendor and employee payment\
  \ programs.  The reviews constitute a robust monitoring program for improper payments\
  \ and consistently return a zero percent error rate.  The most recent Fiscal Years’\
  \ (2020 and 2021) results concluded that there was no indication of improper payments.\
  \  In addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes a HR Links\
  \ report of hours certified by supervisors and a GSA report which identifies the\
  \ payroll amount for the same period.  A comparison of the two reports is completed\
  \ to verify that the two totals reconcile.  Based on the comparisons, results have\
  \ not returned any indication of improper payments related to payroll.  Thus, no\
  \ recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor and employee payments\
  \ would be deemed cost effective as current management controls are proving effective."

detail_dpa5: We have determined that our current business processes, data sources,
  and the Do Not Pay Initiative are effective in detecting and preventing benefit
  overpayments. As a benefit paying agency, the RRB receives pre-payment information
  regarding benefit entitlement at other agencies and wage information.  We have ongoing
  data sources established and in use for this information, which includes benefit
  entitlement and wages from SSA, employers, and our application process. We also
  receive post-payment wage information through established sources such as wage matching
  programs with the fifty states. In addition, we receive death data directly from
  SSA and CMS, which provides us with detailed death information.
detail_exs1: The RRB has benefit paying and non-benefit paying programs with outlays
  over $10M.  The benefit paying programs consist of railroad retirement and survivor
  benefit (RRA) payments and railroad unemployment and sickness insurance benefit
  (RUIA) payments.  Non-benefit paying programs include vendor payments and employee
  payments (payroll, travel, and other reimbursable expenses).  The RRB conducted
  Risk Assessments for the RRA, RUIA, vendor payment, and employee payment programs
  and included them in the FY 2020 Performance and Accountability Report. All four
  of these programs currently fall in Phase 1, below the statutory thresholds for
  significant improper payments under PIIA.  Due to program changes implemented by
  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), a Risk Assessment
  was conducted for the RUIA program in FY 2021.  This fiscal year we conducted another
  RUIA Risk Assessment due to the passages of the Continued Assistance to Railway
  Workers Act of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.  These two subsequent
  RUIA Risk Assessments concluded that the program remains below the statutory thresholds
  for significant improper payments under PIIA.
