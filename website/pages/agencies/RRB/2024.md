detail_ara2_3: We have a robust, multi-faceted review process in place that is an
  effective approach for evaluating payment accuracy in the Railroad Retirement and
  Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act programs and identifying and preventing improper
  payments.  The RRB notified OMB of our approach in August 2011.  The agency is diligent
  in its recovery efforts for overpayments.  The agency conducts numerous quality
  assurance reviews focused on detecting improper payments in the vendor and employee
  payment programs.  The reviews constitute a robust monitoring program for improper
  payments and consistently return a zero percent error rate.  The most recent Fiscal
  Years (2022 and 2023) results concluded that there was no indication of improper
  payments.  In addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes
  a HR Links report of hours certified by surpervisors and a General Services Administration's
  report which identifies the payroll amount for the same period.  A comparison of
  the two reports is completed to verify that the two totals reconcile.  Based on
  the comparisons, results have not returned any indication of improper payments related
  to payroll.  Thus, no recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor and
  employee payments would be deemed cost effective as current management controls
  are proving effective.  Taken as a whole, our full range of current activities constitutes
  an effective alternative to a formal payment recapture program.  However, despite
  the agency's best efforts to prevent improper payments, some will always occur due
  to lack of timely information, etc.

detail_dpa5: 'We have determined that our current business processes, data sources,
  and the Do Not Pay Initiative are effective in detecting and preventing benefit
  overpayments. As a benefit paying agency, the RRB receives

  pre-payment information regarding benefit entitlement at other agencies and wage
  information. We have ongoing data sources established and in use for this information,
  which includes benefit entitlement and wages from SSA, employers, and our application
  process. We also receive post-payment wage information through established sources
  such as wage matching programs with the fifty states. In addition, we receive death
  data directly from SSA and CMS, which provides us with detailed death information.'
detail_exs1: "The RRB has benefit paying and non-benefit paying programs with outlays\
  \ over $10M. The benefit paying programs consist of railroad retirement and survivor\
  \ benefit (RRA) payments and railroad unemployment and sickness insurance benefit\
  \ (RUIA) payments. Non-benefit paying programs include vendor payments and employee\
  \ payments (payroll, travel, and other reimbursable expenses). During FY 2023, the\
  \ RRB conducted Risk Assessments for the RRA, vendor payment, and employee payment\
  \ programs. These Risk Assessments concluded that all three programs continue to\
  \ remain below the statutory thresholds for significant improper payments under\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) and shall remain in Phase 1.  The\
  \ next scheduled Risk Assessment for these programs is FY 2026, unless any of them\
  \ experience significant changes in legislation and/or a significant increase in\
  \ funding levels. \n\nA Risk Assessment for the RUIA program was conducted in FY\
  \ 2022 due to the passages of the Continued Assistance to Railway Workers Act of\
  \ 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The results of this Risk Assessment\
  \ also concluded that the RUIA program remains below the statutory thresholds for\
  \ significant improper payments under PIIA and should continue to operate under\
  \ Phase 1.  Since the RUIA program did not experience any significant changes in\
  \ legislation and/or a significant increase in funding levels during FY 2022, the\
  \ program is now in a three-year Risk Assessment cycle with the next one scheduled\
  \ for FY 2025."

detail_pcp14: "The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is responsible for reporting on\
  \ our two benefit payment programs (RRA and RUIA) as well as two non-benefit programs\
  \ (vendor and employee payments). \n\nIn FY 2024, the RRB’s OIG contracted with\
  \ Harper, Rains, Knight, and Company, P.A. (HRK) to conduct the audit of the RRB’s\
  \ compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) of 2019 for FY 2023.\
  \  In HRK’s audit report (24-07), they determined that the RRB complied with the\
  \ PIIA since all of the 10 payment integrity reporting requirements were satisfied,\
  \ and they also determined that the RRB’s payment integrity reporting was complete\
  \ and accurate.  HRK did not make any new recommendations for the RRB in their PIIA\
  \ audit report (24-07)."
