detail_ara2_3: The last analysis NARA completed to determine whether recovery audits
  would be cost effective, they randomly selected several accounting firms located
  in the DC metro area from the GSA schedule (SIN 520-9).  Using the price list, NARA
  compared the hourly charge for one supervisor, one staff accountant/analyst and
  one technician/data entry specialist.  NARA's improper payments were divided by
  the hourly cost for each vendor to determine how many hours could be billed at that
  rate before the cost of the audit would exceed the yearly improper payments identified.  NARA's
  programs have not changed.  NARA's improper payments are recovered nearly 100% through
  its standard recovery methods and therefore, it has never proved cost effective
  for NARA to engage an audit firm to conduct payment recovery audits.

detail_dpa5: NARA's financial shared service provider, the Department of Treasury,
  Bureau of Fiscal Service, runs weekly checks on disbursed payments against the DNP/Treasury
  Working System.  Incorrect DNP information is rarely identified and therefore, corrections
  are rare.  However when they are discovered, immediate corrective action is taken.  We
  are not aware of any NARA payments that were stopped by DNP in FY 2022.
