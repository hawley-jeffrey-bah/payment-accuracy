detail_ara2_3: "The last analysis NARA completed to determine whether recovery audits\
  \ would be cost effective, they randomly selected several accounting firms located\
  \ in the DC metro area from the GSA schedule (SIN 520-9). Using the price list,\
  \ NARA compared the hourly charge for one supervisor, one staff accountant/analyst\
  \ and one technician/data entry specialist.  NARA's improper payments were divided\
  \ by\nthe hourly cost for each vendor to determine how many hours could be billed\
  \ at that rate before the cost of the audit would exceed the yearly improper payments\
  \ identified.  \n\nNARA's programs have not changed.  NARA's improper payments are\
  \ recovered nearly 100% through its standard recovery methods and\ntherefore, it\
  \ has never proved cost effective for NARA to engage an audit firm to conduct payment\
  \ recovery audits."
