  - Barriers: Typically the provider payments are automatically calculated via our
      Distribution Database however for the improper payment, the payment was unable
      to be automatically calculated due to errors in pulling the file information
      in the system. The service types are paid out based upon the requested minutes
      so the user input the minutes into the form but numbers were entered in error
      resulting in an inaccurate calculation and payment.
    Info: The improper payment was a result of a manual calculation that had to be
      done as a result of a system error. The manual calculation was not effectively
      communicated with the signers therefore there was no additional checks completed
      to find the error.

  - Barriers: The main financial barrier for inadequate documentation related to assets
      stems from the carrier’s lack of maintaining adequate documentation to confirm
      assets were reported accurately.
    Info: High Cost carriers must file FCC Form 481 report with USAC on an annual
      basis. This form collects financial and operations information used to validate
      carrier support.  This form collects financial and operations information used
      to validate carrier support and fulfills the annual 54.313 certification requirement.

  - Barriers: "The financial barriers prohibiting prevention of improper payments\
      \ include compliance issues related to non-usage, such as documentation not\
      \ provided or inadequate documentation.  \n"
    Info: The Lifeline program participating providers did not maintain adequate documentation
      to support eligibility, which could result in funding to ineligible program
      subscribers.

  - Barriers: 'The financial barriers for competitive bidding include: invalid contract,
      lack of documentation, failure to use price as the primary factor, and failure
      to wait the mandatory minimum 28 day period prior to selecting a service provider(s).'
    Info: 'Schools and Libraries program applicants must conduct fair and open competitive

      bidding processes and select the most cost-effective service using the price
      of the eligible equipment and services as the primary factor. Schools and Libraries
      program participants must also retain documentation demonstrating compliance
      with the program rules for at least 10 years after the end of the funding year
      or

      last date of service delivery, whichever is later.

detail_exs1: "In accordance with the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002,\
  \ as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010,\
  \ Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) of 2012, and\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) of 2019, the Commission has made significant\
  \ efforts to implement policies and procedures to strengthen internal controls that\
  \ prevent improper payments. In addition, the Commission oversees a payment recapture\
  \ program that includes both audits and transaction testing to search for and recapture\
  \ over payments.\n\nThe FCC's improper payments in each of its Phase 2 programs\
  \ has come down significantly over the last 5 years.  \n\nUSF High Cost - The USF\
  \ high cost program being the most complex program has made adjustments to its review\
  \ procedures.  Additionally, on the recommendation of the FCC OIG and OMB, we split\
  \ the high cost program into two distinctly separate programs, the high cost legacy\
  \ program and the high cost modernized program.  A risk assessment was performed\
  \ in FY21 on each of the programs. Through these risk assessment, it was determined\
  \ that the high cost legacy program had significant risks and was subject to improper\
  \ payments reporting.  However, the USF high cost modernized program was not subject\
  \ to significant risks.  The FCC performed a statistically valid sample of the USF\
  \ high cost legacy program and it was determined the estimated improper payments\
  \ in the program amounted to 2.87% which was above the statutory limits. The FCC\
  \ and USAC have reviewed the two major root causes in this program that are driving\
  \ the improper payments (misclassification of assets and depreciation) estimate\
  \ and are committed to working with carriers through outreach and training in order\
  \ to reduce the improper payments below the statutory threshold.  \n\nUSF - Lifeline\
  \ - This program has shown a significant reduction in improper payments estimates.\
  \  In FY17 the improper payment rate hit its peak of 21.93% and has significantly\
  \ fallen since to 13.81% in FY20 to its lowest rate of 2.18% in the current reporting\
  \ period.  The reason was clear to the FCC and USAC since there were a few opt-out\
  \ states that are not required to follow the FCC rules for determining eligibility\
  \ requirements through the National Verifier system. We had discussion with the\
  \ state PUC's in these opt-out states explaining the importance of ensuring their\
  \ controls and review processes were more in line with USAC's processes. The FCC\
  \ and USAC's hard worked has paid off as we continue to enhance our controls to\
  \ reduce improper payments even further.  \n\nUSF - Schools and Libraries -  The\
  \ Schools and Libraries program continues to be above the statutory threshold of\
  \ 1.5% of program outlays and $10 million.  Last fiscal year the error rate in the\
  \ program increased by a little to 3.73%, however, for this current reporting period\
  \ the improper payment error rate decreased to 1.59%.  As with the other programs\
  \ that are reporting on improper payments, the FCC and USAC continuously review\
  \ root causes in this program and competitive bidding along with invoicing errors\
  \ continues to be the drivers of the improper payments error rate. The FCC in conjunction\
  \ with our Administrator are in the process of making the necessary adjustments\
  \ to the invoicing process and the competitive bidding requirements.  The FCC is\
  \ committed to finding solutions to the root causes so that it is able to bring\
  \ down the improper payment estimate even further. \n\nTRS - The Telecommunications\
  \ Relay Service program was moved to phase 2 in FY22 due to a provider entering\
  \ into a consent decree with the FCC due to a large overpayment which has now been\
  \ recovered.  Through testing of transaction in the current year, TRS will move\
  \ back to phase 1 due to their improper payments rate being below the statutory\
  \ threshold for reporting on improper payments.\n\nThroughout the years the the\
  \ FCC has made great strides in updating its controls and oversight in its programs\
  \ and strives to bring all programs back to phase 1 reporting. This has been a monumental\
  \ undertaking by the FCC and its partners and we continue to make improvements each\
  \ year.  The FCC takes seriously the recommendations provided by the OIG and its\
  \ auditor so that our programs are in total compliance with the guidelines outlined\
  \ in OMB M-21-19. \n\n"
detail_pcp12_1: '2'
detail_pcp14: In its most recent PIIA audit report the auditor identified 5 findings
  resulting in ten recommendations.  The FCC takes seriously the findings and recommendations
  from the OIG and its auditor.  The FCC is committed to making the necessary improvements
  to its programs and will work with its partners and its OIG to ensure compliance.  Some
  of the recommendation highlights included making changes to our overall risk assessment
  process, accurately reporting improper payments outside of audit recapture, making
  improvements to the USF-Schools and Libraries program, especially in the competitive
  bidding process and developing written policies and procedures for our TRS program.
detail_raa8: 'Yes'
detail_raa9: The Commission changed its risk assessment methodology based on the auditors
  recommendation.  The auditors recommended the Commission incorporate the ERM framework
  to include a risk scoring and weighting factor of the risks in a particular program.
  The new methodology was used for the current reporting cycle.
