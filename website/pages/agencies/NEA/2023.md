detail_dpa5: 'Our financial system provider, ESC, verifies an entity against both
  SAM and the Internal Revenue Serviceâ€™s taxpayer identification number (TIN) prior
  to establishing them as a vendor in the financial accounting systems. ESC also integrates
  SAM.gov with the financial system to manage supplier databases in order to improve
  the accuracy of data. ESC uses the Do Not Pay (DNP) business center at the Treasury
  Department to improve the quality and integrity of system financial information
  through the use of the DNP Analytics service where vendor profiles are matched against
  the Death Master File. Vendor maintenance processes are also performed by ESC to
  deactivate profiles without activity for eighteen months.


  We believe our use of Do Not Pay via ESC has resulted in reduced improper payments.'
detail_exs1: "The Arts Endowment uses the following steps to analyze and conduct risk\
  \ assessments on improper payments\n\n1.\tQualitative program and payment procedures\
  \ review conducted of all programs and activities\n2.\tRisk of Improper payments\
  \ considered for each program and activity\n3.\tDetermination made if the program\
  \ or activity is likely to have improper payments in excess of either $10M and 1.5%\
  \ of program outlays or $100M.\n\nIn review of the annual program appropriations\
  \ presented in the risk assessment table, there is no risk of significant improper\
  \ payments given that the $10M and $100M thresholds could not be met or exceeded\
  \ with existing appropriations.\n"
