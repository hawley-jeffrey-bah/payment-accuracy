detail_ara2_3: OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C provides guidance for agencies to determine
  if cost-effective payment recapture audits can be performed. The Department had
  been performing, from 2005 through June 2017, primarily with contractor assistance,
  annual payment recapture audits of contracts/obligations for many of the Department’s
  bureaus/ reporting entities on a rotational basis. Annual payment recapture auditing
  was additionally performed by a contractor, effective 2011, for Department-wide
  grants and other cooperative agreements (i.e., financial assistance). In March 2018,
  the Department completed a cost/benefit analysis for contracts/obligations and for
  grants and other cooperative agreements and determined that it was not able to conduct
  a cost-effective payment recapture audit program (one in which the benefits, including
  recaptured amounts, exceed the costs) for the above noted categories. The Department
  continues to periodically evaluate if there are any categories of disbursements
  for which payment recapture auditing could be or could become cost-effective.
detail_ara2_3_2: The Department currently has not identified any areas Department-wide
  or otherwise where it might be cost-effective to conduct payment recapture audits.

  eligibility reviews and reviews of the Do Not Pay portal post-payment match reports,
  the Department has not had any significant true matches to DMF and SAM Exclusion
  Records. While the Department’s use of the Do Not Pay portal since inception has
  not yet identified or led to the prevention of any significant improper payments,
  the Department supports the use of the Do Not Pay portal as a sound financial management
  practice to identify and minimize improper payments.
detail_exs1: "DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE KEY PAYMENT INTEGRITY EFFORTS\n\nImproper Payments\
  \ Risk Assessment Process\n\nThe Department annually assesses the effectiveness\
  \ of internal control over financial reporting, in compliance with OMB Circular\
  \ A-123, Appendix C. Furthermore, as scheduled, the assessment includes reviews\
  \ of internal controls over various disbursement processes. The most recent reviews\
  \ performed indicated that internal controls over various disbursement processes\
  \ were sound.\nEach of the Department’s bureaus/reporting entities periodically\
  \ completes or updates, over a one to three-year period (depending on the size of\
  \ the entity), improper payments risk assessments covering all of its programs/activities\
  \ as required by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C. These improper payments risk assessments\
  \ of the entity’s programs/activities also incorporate improper payments risk assessments\
  \ every three years of the control, procurement, and grants management environments.\n\
  \nImproper Payments and Recaptures of Improper Payments\n\nThe Department has extensive\
  \ payment integrity monitoring, minimization, recapturing, and corrective actions\
  \ efforts in place, including the identification of improper payments through bureau\
  \ post-payment reviews, the Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits\
  \ or reviews, Single Audit Act audits of grants/cooperative agreements, other grants/cooperative\
  \ agreements audits or reviews, contract closeout reviews, grants/cooperative agreements\
  \ closeout reviews, other audits or reviews, and sample reviews of Department-wide\
  \ sustained disallowed costs.\n\nThe Department’s bureaus report improper payments\
  \ and related recaptures information (recaptures information for improper payments\
  \ of $10 thousand or more) to the Department’s Office of Financial Management (OFM)\
  \ on a quarterly basis. OFM then tracks the improper payments of $10 thousand or\
  \ more that have not been fully recaptured, and periodically throughout the fiscal\
  \ year requests updates from the responsible bureaus on tracked, unrecaptured improper\
  \ payments.\n\nOMB Circular A-123, Appendix C provides guidance for agencies to\
  \ determine if cost-effective payment recapture audits can be performed. The Department\
  \ had been performing, from 2005 through June 2017, primarily with contractor assistance,\
  \ annual payment recapture audits of contracts/obligations for many of the Department’s\
  \ bureaus/ reporting entities on a rotational basis. Annual payment recapture auditing\
  \ was additionally performed by a contractor, effective 2011, for Department-wide\
  \ grants and other cooperative agreements (i.e., financial assistance). In March\
  \ 2018, the Department completed a cost/benefit analysis for contracts/obligations\
  \ and for grants and other cooperative agreements and determined that it was not\
  \ able to conduct a cost-effective payment recapture audit program (one in which\
  \ the benefits, including recaptured amounts, exceed the costs) for the above noted\
  \ categories. The Department continues to periodically evaluate if there are any\
  \ categories of disbursements for which payment recapture auditing could be or could\
  \ become cost-effective.\n\nImproper Payments Statistical Sampling and Estimation\
  \ Process\n\nOn February 9, 2018, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget\
  \ Act of 2018, which included supplemental appropriations to many federal agencies\
  \ for disaster relief purposes. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was\
  \ appropriated $600.0 million and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\
  \ (NOAA) was appropriated $400.1 million.\n\nFor FY 2022, the Department was required\
  \ to submit statistical sampling and estimation plans to OMB and perform statistically\
  \ valid sampling for FY 2021 disbursements of the above noted disaster relief funds\
  \ received by both EDA and NOAA, because the FY 2021 disbursements of these funds\
  \ for each bureau exceeded $10.0 million. The Department complied with all requirements\
  \ through the services of a contractor. \n\nPlease see the rest of our FY 2022 submission\
  \ for additional details on the results for this reporting period."
