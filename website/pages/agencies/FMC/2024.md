  \ quarterly and annual reviews of disbursements to identify potential improper payments,\
  \ including overpayments, underpayments, and duplicate transactions.\n•\tMonitored\

  •\tReconciled CBA and IBA travel card statements monthly to detect and address potential\
  \ overdue accounts or errors.\n•\tReviewed all purchase card (P-Card) transactions\

  \ with Auditors and Compliance Reporting\n•\tCollaborated with external auditors\
  \ to support the Annual Financial Statement Audit and ensure adherence to federal\
  \ payment integrity standards.\n•\tSubmitted Financial Statements and Treasury Reports\
  \ (GTAS) on a timely basis, ensuring payment data accuracy for transparency and\
  \ audit compliance.\n4.\t G-Invoicing and Inter-Agency Reconciliations\n•\tManaged\
  \ inter-agency agreements through G-Invoicing and resolved discrepancies in 7600A/B\
  \ forms to ensure accurate payments.\n•\tProcessed Inter-Agency Payments and Collections\
