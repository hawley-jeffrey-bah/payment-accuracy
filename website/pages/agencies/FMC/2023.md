detail_dpa3: My agency did not identify any incorrect information
detail_dpa5: The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) through its shared service provider,
  U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Fiscal Service, utilizes the Do Not Pay Initiative information
  when making obligations and expenditures. The FMC has an extremely low improper
  payment rate and cannot opine on whether that information, in of itself, has reduced
  improper payments.
detail_exs1: The FMC does not currently have any programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 with
  cash outlays over $10 million dollars.  Therefore, under PIIA the FMC does not have
  any programs that are likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: The OIG suggested the Office of Budget and Finance (OBF) follow the
  requirements related to the formulation and inclusion of payment integrity information
  on PaymentAccuracy.gov, and completion of all applicable reporting requirements
  for the OMB data call. Additionally, all responses to the OMB payment integrity
  data call should be reviewed by the Deputy CFO prior to submission.
