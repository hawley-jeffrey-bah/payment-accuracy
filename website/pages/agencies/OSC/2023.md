detail_dpa5: OSC has no confirmed fraud, and has not used the Do Not Pay initiative
  to reduce improper payments or awards, as a result.  OSC also utilizes shared service
  providers for payroll, financial system operations, and for contracting, which further
  minimizes any possible improper payment or award that could potentially occur.
detail_exs1: OSC's appropriation in FY 2022 of $31.904M was comprised primarily by
  salaries, benefits, and rent, and OSC only has one appropriation/PPA, so the only
  "program" with +$10M in outlays is primarily from salaries and benefits.  OSC utilized
  USDA/NFC for payroll processing, and reviews/validates payroll files that come in.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: OSC does not have an in-house OIG, and utilizes USDA OIG to handle any
  claims against the agency, but USDA OIG does not weigh in on improper payments and
  unknown payments.
