detail_dpa5: OSC is a small, independent federal agency that utilizes the financial
  shared services of the Department of Interior's Interior Business Center, and thus
  does not participate in this initiative.  Also, OSC conducts an annual audit with
  independent auditors that have found OSC's financial management practices sufficient
  to identify and address any instances of improper payments, of which there are very
  little to none, in any given year.
detail_exs1: "OSC’s management is responsible for managing risks, as well as establishing\
  \ and maintaining effective internal control and financial management systems that\
  \ meet the objectives of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA).\
  \ OSC conducted its assessment of internal controls over the effectiveness and efficiency\
  \ of operations and compliance with applicable laws and regulations in accordance\
  \ with OMB Circular A-123, “Management’s Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management\
  \ and Internal Control.” Based on the results of this evaluation, OSC can provide\
  \ reasonable assurance that, as of September 30, 2022, its internal controls over\
  \ the effectiveness and efficiency of operations were compliant with applicable\
  \ laws and regulations. Further, OSC certifies that the appropriate policies and\
  \ controls are in place to mitigate the risk of fraud and inappropriate charge card\
  \ practices. \n\nFor its financial reporting needs, OSC works with the Interior\
  \ Business Center (IBC). OSC obtains the SSAE 18 report from IBC, as well as the\
  \ year-end roll forward assertion letter, and reviews them to assist in assessing\
  \ internal controls over financial reporting. OSC has not identified any significant\
  \ issues or deviations in its financial reporting during FY 2022 and thus concludes\
  \ that the agency’s internal controls over financial reporting are sufficiently\
  \ strong.\n\nOSC has no in-house financial system. OSC has chosen to use Oracle\
  \ Federal Financials in an environment hosted by IBC, a shared service provider.\
  \ Because of the rigorous testing that IBC undergoes, OSC considers its financial\
  \ system to be reliable and effective. \n"
