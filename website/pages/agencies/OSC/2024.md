detail_agy1: Again, OSC is a small, independent federal agency with one program.  It
  primarily funds salaries, benefits, and rent.

detail_ara2_1: null
detail_ara2_2: null
detail_ara2_3: OSC's has 2 Finance staff, and a CFO.  It's spending is largely made
  up of salaries, benefits, and rent, which OSC's tracks closely throughout the fiscal
  year with our HR staff, as well as our payroll provider, NFC.  OSC would require
  additional staff to perform any such audits that are outside of the annual, standard
  financial audit, and any such audits would return negligible results, thus rendering
  them inefficient.
detail_ara2_3_2: OSC has one program.  It is comprised of all of OSC's funds, of which
  90 percent go to salaries, benefits, and rent.  Any discretionary spending outside
  of that is tied up in operational contracts, or equipment purchases, which follow
  clear processes and have a clear cost basis.

detail_arp18: OSC goes through an extensive, independent financial audit every fiscal
  year with independent auditors.  OSC does not have the staff bandwidth to perform
  separate audits throughout the fiscal year, and any issues uncovered during the
  standard financial audit are reviewed and addressed timely.

detail_dpa5: OSC does not use the DNP initiative.  90 percent or more of OSC's annual
  spending is made up of salaries, benefits, and/or rent, which leads very little
  spending for discretionary items.  The discretionary items that OSC does purchase
  are reflected in quotes from vendors, or contracts facilitated by assisted acquisition
  providers, therefore providing very little possibility of error or improper payment.
detail_exs1: OSC is a small, independent federal agency, whose spending is consumed
  by salaries, benefits, and rent primarily (around 90 percent).  OSC's discretionary
  spending outside of those categories is very minimal, and as such, improper payments
  are negligible at best in any given fiscal year.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: OSC does not have an OIG, as it is a small, independent federal agency.  Any
  issues discovered by our standard independent financial auditors are addressed in
  a timely manner, and OSC has not had any recommendations to improve the prevention
  and reduction of improper payments.
