    Info: "Specific financial eligibility criteria are detailed in Title 13 of the\
      \ Code of Federal Regulations and in two of SBA's Standard Operating Procedures.\
      \ \n\nSBA does not make loans directly to borrowers:  SBA provides a guaranty\
      \ to a lender which makes the loan to a borrower.  \n\nTo be eligible for an\
      \ SBA business loan, an applicant must (1) be an operating business (except\
      \ for loans to Eligible Passive Companies); (2) be organized for profit; (3)\
      \ be located in the United States; (4) be small under the size requirements\
      \ in 13 CFR part 121; and, (5) be able to demonstrate a need for the desired\
      \ credit.\n\nIn general, a Lender may demand in writing that SBA honor its guarantee\
      \ if the Borrower is in default on any installment for more than 60 calendar\
      \ days.  However, SBA is released from liability if on a loan guarantee if any\
      \ of the events below occur: \n(1) The Lender has failed to comply materially\
      \ with any Loan Program Requirement for 7(a) loans. \n(2) The Lender has failed\
      \ to make, close, service, or liquidate a loan in a prudent manner; \n(3) The\
      \ Lender's improper action or inaction has placed SBA at risk; \n(4) The Lender\
      \ has failed to disclose a material fact to SBA regarding a guaranteed loan\
      \ in a timely manner; \n(5) The Lender has misrepresented a material fact to\
      \ SBA regarding a guaranteed loan; \n(6) SBA has received a written request\
      \ from the Lender to terminate the guarantee; or, \n(7) The Lender has not paid\
      \ the guarantee fee within the period required under SBA rules and regulations."

    Info: 'The specific Receiving Benefits from Other Sources eligibility criteria
      include SBA policy which prevents the duplication of disaster funds from other
      sources when determining eligible loan amount. Policy requires that any grants,
      insurance, or other disaster financial assistance received from other sources
      that duplicates SBA loan eligibility, be deducted when determining the SBA loan
      amount.

    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources
- Program_Name: Disaster Assistance Loans
  Themes:
  - Barriers: "The primary barriers in obtaining necessary financial data are: 1)\
      \ Being able to contact the applicant post disasters. 2) Data may be delayed\
      \ in being received based on amount of damaged received by the disaster survivor.\
      \ 3) Data may have been destroyed due to the disaster. \n"

  - Barriers: "Barriers that that impact receiving benefits from other sources are:\
      \ 1. Insurance Agents/ Companies may be located in the declared disaster area\
      \ and may be impacted by the disaster as well. 2. SBA loan may be made prior\
      \ to FEMA grants. 3. State and Local grant programs can be established after\
      \ the declared disaster creating a gap between when loan is approved and grants\
      \ approved. \n"
    Info: Policy prevents SBA from duplicating funds when determining loan amount.
      As a result, policy requires any grants, insurance, or duplication of benefits
      received from other sources which duplicate loan eligibility be deducted when
      determining loan amount.

      are not eligible unless the legal basis upon which the individual has been admitted
      is a covered category. Refer to Appendix 7 for additional information.'

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: To ensure that the updates made in FY 2023 to the qualitative
    risk assessment did not materiality impact the results of the risk assessments
    completed in FY 2022, the SBA conducted risk assessment mock-ups for every single
    program that was risk assessed in FY 2022 to determine if the new risk assessment
    made a material difference in the risk rating for those programs.  Of the total
    risk assessments completed in FY 2022, only two programs had a difference in the
    risk assessment results - the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program and the Shuttered
    Venue Operators Grant program.  In anticipation of the potential risk of improper
    payments within these two programs, the SBA proactively conducted improper payment
    testing on a statistical sample of the outlays for these two programs, and are
    reporting improper payment estimates for these two programs in FY 2023.

detail_ara2_3: "On September 15, 2011, the SBA submitted a Payment Recapture Audit\
  \ Cost-Effective Analysis to the Office of Management and Budget. The analysis discussed\
  \ the 7(a) Business Loan Guaranty Program, the 504 Certified Development Company\
  \ Loan Guaranty Program, the Disaster Direct Loan Program, Disbursements for Goods\
  \ and Services, the Small Business Investment Company Financing Guaranty Program,\
  \ the Surety Bond Guaranty Program, and Grants, which included all grant programs.\
  \ The analysis described the program, the controls over financial disbursements,\
  \ and the size of the program and concluded for each program that recapture audits\
  \ would not be cost effective due to low error rates, complexity of the program,\
  \ or limited amount of outlays. A subsequent cost analysis for the 7(a) loan guaranty\
  \ purchase program was submitted to OMB on September 13, 2017, to include the results\
  \ of a payment recapture audit performed in 2015, which again concluded that such\
  \ an audit is not cost effective. In FY 2022, the SBA performed a cost-benefit analysis\
  \ for programs with over $1 million in disbursements and not covered by the analysis\
  \ completed in 2011, and concluded that it would not be cost-effective to perform\
  \ a recovery audit. Some of the factors considered include the following: program\
  \ was not identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments in the\
  \ last risk assessment, there have been no recent audit findings or reports to suggest\
  \ that the program is susceptible to improper payments, prior internal control assessments\
  \ did not identify the program as being susceptible to significant improper payments,\
  \ and the cost to perform a recovery audit exceeded the potential recovery amount.\
  \ \n\nIn FY 2023, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits. As mentioned above,\
  \ in prior years, the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses on programs subject\
  \ to payment recapture audit, and deemed the costs to perform a payment recapture\
  \ audit outweighed the benefits of the audit. \n\nIn lieu of recovery audits, for\
  \ programs currently reporting improper payment estimates, the improper payment\
  \ review testing and results from the testing were leveraged to identify potential\
  \ payments that could be recovered.  In addition to that, there are also other reviews\
  \ (internal control assessments, post-award reviews, monthly QA reviews, cost compliance\
  \ reviews, etc.) conducted on those programs that are outside of the recovery audit\
  \ process that were also leveraged to identify improper payments.  \n\nAlthough\
  \ recovery audits are not performed, the SBA does conduct recovery activities for\
  \ improper payments identified outside of the recovery audit process.   For example,\
  \ on 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, overpayments identified in the improper payments\
  \ review are recaptured from the lender, on disaster direct loans and COVID-EIDL\
  \ loans, overpayments identified are recovered through loan modifications, on EIDL\
  \ advances, overpayments can be recovered via fund offsets or referral to OIG, for\
  \ PPP loans, overpayments can be recovered through loan modifications and repayment,\
  \ for RRF awards, overpayments are recovered via demand letters sent to awardees,\
  \ and for SVOG, overpayments are recovered through demand letters, and Treasury\
  \ debt cross-servicing."

detail_cap4: Improper payments oversight falls under the OPPCFO’s management and the
  internal control program, while improper payment assessments and implementing/maintaining
  successful internal controls is a shared responsibility across OPPCFO and SBA’s
  program offices.  As such, within the SBA’s SOPs, there are direct linkages between
  senior management and their responsibilities for maintaining not only an effective
  internal control system, but also complying with laws and regulations.  For example,
  under SOP 00 02, Internal Control System, management board members and district
  directors are responsible for maintaining effective systems of internal controls.  Additionally,
  under SOP 20 31, Internal Control, senior management is responsible for establishing
  and monitoring, within their areas of responsibility, an internal control structure
  that provides reasonable assurance that operations are being run in an efficient
  and effective manner and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

  disbursements that have not been disbursements yet, SBA would require the recipients
  to resolve the DNP finding prior to becoming eligible for SBA funding.  For disbursements
  that have already been sent to the recipient, SBA would place a hold code on the
  loan or grant and/or deny future loan or grant requests or loan relief requests
  until the recipient was able to successfully resolve the DNP finding.
detail_exs1: "In FY 2023, the SBA has made great strides in our payment integrity\
  \ efforts.  Although the SBA was found to be non-compliant with the Payment Integrity\
  \ Information Act (PIIA) by the OIG in their FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit, the\
  \ SBA continues to make payment integrity efforts and reducing improper payments\
  \ a priority.  The SBA has already implemented several corrective actions to address\
  \ the OIG recommendations, and are continuing our efforts to implement additional\
  \ corrective action plans to address the remaining OIG recommendations with an anticipated\
  \ closure date of May 2024 for all OIG recommendations identified during the FY\
  \ 2023 PIIA Compliance audit.  \n\nTo further address risks related to improper\
  \ payments, the SBA performs qualitative risk assessments on programs not reporting\
  \ improper payment estimates to identify programs susceptible to significant improper\
  \ payments.  The SBA's risk assessments are performed on a 3-year rotational basis\
  \ with our last round of risk assessments completed in FY 2022.  In FY 2023, the\
  \ SBA conducted one qualitative risk assessment for the Congressional Grants program\
  \ and concluded the program was not susceptible to significant improper payments.\
  \  This program began reporting in Phase 1 in FY 2023.  Additionally, in anticipation\
  \ of the potential risk of improper payments (and from non-compliances identified\
  \ in the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit), the SBA chose to proactively conduct improper\
  \ payment testing on a statistical sample of the outlays for the Restaurant Revitalization\
  \ Fund program and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program and are reporting\
  \ improper payment estimates for these two programs in FY 2023.\n\nOn an annual\
  \ basis, the SBA monitors programmatic activities by reviewing the outlays data\
  \ for each SBA program to identify programs that had significant changes in outlays\
  \ and/or programs that are now in Phase 1.  In FY 2023, a total of ten programs\
  \ are in Phase 2.  Of the ten programs reporting in Phase 2, two programs are related\
  \ to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) (PPP Loan Guaranty Purchases and PPP\
  \ Loan Forgiveness), two are COVID-pandemic related programs that are new for this\
  \ year (Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) program and Shuttered Venue Operators\
  \ Grant (SVOG) program), two are COVID-pandemic related programs that were introduced\
  \ in FY 2022 (COVID-EIDL and EIDL Advance), and the remaining four are regular SBA\
  \ programs.  In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance audit, the SBA bifurcated\
  \ out the PPP reporting into three reporting categories - PPP Approvals, PPP Forgiveness,\
  \ and PPP Purchases.  Since the SBA is no longer issuing PPP loans, PPP Approvals\
  \ was not reported on this year.  SBA has drafted and implemented CAPs related to\
  \ each of the ten Phase 2 programs.  \n\n"

detail_pcp14: "In the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit, the SBA OIG noted the following\
  \ recommendations:\nThe OIG recommended the OPPCFO enhance existing procedures using\
  \ the GAO Greenbook to design and implement a robust internal and quality control\
  \ process to ensure risk assessment appropriately meet PIIA reporting objectives,\
  \ provide training to responsible staff involved in the payment integrity reporting\
  \ process, communicate with OMB to ensure accuracy of improper payment data, and\
  \ continue to provide training and collaborate with program office staff to ensure\
  \ timely and complete reconciliation of population data.  \nThe OIG recommended\
  \ the OCA to collaborate with responsible staff in the payment integrity reporting\
  \ process to ensure timely reconciliation of population data, formally document\
  \ and implement appropriate preventative and monitoring controls prior to approval\
  \ of 7(a) loan guaranty purchases, exercise effective management review controls\
  \ over statistician's work, and design and document adequate review procedures to\
  \ ensure results of sample meet PIIA objectives.\n"
detail_raa8: 'Yes'
detail_raa9: To ensure that the updates made in FY 2023 to the qualitative risk assessment
  did not materiality impact the results of the risk assessments completed in FY 2022,
  the SBA conducted risk assessment mock-ups for every single program that was risk
  assessed in FY 2022 to determine if the new risk assessment made a material difference
  in the risk rating for those programs.  Of the total risk assessments completed
  in FY 2022, only two programs had a difference in the risk assessment results -
  the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant
  program.  In anticipation of the potential risk of improper payments within these
  two programs, the SBA proactively conducted improper payment testing on a statistical
  sample of the outlays for these two programs, and are reporting improper payment
  estimates for these two programs in FY 2023.
