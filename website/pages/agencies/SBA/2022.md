detail_arp18: "The SBA makes every effort to recover improper payments identified\
  \ during their improper payment review process.  This recovery effort is independent\
  \ of the recapture audit process, which can be deemed costly and ineffective.  The\
  \ SBA's process for recovering improper payments commences at the program office\
  \ where the improper payments are identified.  The agency efforts to recapture improper\
  \ payments are discussed by program or activity below.\n(a) Loan Program Purchases\
  \ - Overpayments identified in the improper payments’ reviews are recaptured from\
  \ the lender. The Quality Control staff tracks and collects any monetary overpayment.\
  \ In some instances, the loan is referred to the Guaranty Denial Team for further\
  \ action. Determination of a course of action is made on a case-by-case basis, depending\
  \ on the specific details of the reason for the improper payment. Refer to Part\
  \ I above for corrective action plans to prevent future improper payments.\n7(a)\
  \ Loan Program Approvals and 504 Loan Guaranty Approvals - Overpayments recaptured\
  \ outside payment recapture audits are not applicable to 7(a) loan guaranty approval\
  \ and 504 loan approval as no payment is made at the time of approval. Improper\
  \ payments identified through the annual improper payment reviews in 7(a) and 504\
  \ loan guaranty approvals are resolved through obtaining additional documentation,\
  \ loan modification, or cancellation of the loan. Improper payments identified as\
  \ a result of the FY 2021 PIIA reviews have been resolved through obtaining additional\
  \ documentation, or cancellation or reduction of the loan guaranty and/or referral\
  \ to other offices within the Office of Capital Access, as appropriate. Determination\
  \ of a course of action is made on a case-by-case basis, which varies substantially\
  \ depending on the circumstances of the loan approval and lender’s authority.\n\
  Disaster Direct Loan Program - Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving\
  \ both an SBA loan and insurance payments or other benefits as a result of the disaster.\
  \ If the duplication of benefit is recognized prior to the final disbursement, the\
  \ loan amount is modified to reflect a lower amount and no repayment is required.\
  \ If the duplication of benefit is identified after the final disbursement of the\
  \ loan, then the borrower is given 30 days to provide evidence to prove that the\
  \ disaster loan was not over-disbursed. For example, the borrower can provide documentation\
  \ demonstrating that insurance funds received did not duplicate the disaster loan\
  \ purpose. If the borrower has not provided the appropriate evidence within the\
  \ 30-day period, a demand is made for the over-disbursed funds. Collection efforts\
  \ continue at the Disaster loan servicing centers, but if these efforts fail, the\
  \ borrower will still be liable for the over-disbursed amount in the form of monthly\
  \ payments in accordance with the loan agreement. Thus, any actual loss is the cost\
  \ of funds related to the over disbursement.\nCOVID-Economic Injury Disaster Loan\
  \ (EIDL) (COVID-EIDL) - Improper payments are generally the result of loan documentation\
  \ errors.  Loan documentation legally obligates the recipient of a disaster loan\
  \ to pay back the entire loan amount whether or not the loan contains any improper\
  \ payments.  Therefore, improper payments are not recovered upon discovery but realized\
  \ as the borrower makes each payment on the loan.  \nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan\
  \ Emergency Assistance (Advance) (EIDL Advance) - SBA is developing a plan to assess\
  \ the Emergency EIDL Advances.  SBA will demand repayment for EIDL Advances identified\
  \ as improper.  SBA will explore available options to remedy cases, including recovery\
  \ of funds by offset, referral to OIG’s Division of Investigations, or providing\
  \ supporting documentation where appropriate.  \nPaycheck Protection Program Loans\
  \ - Overpayments are the result of the borrower receiving a PPP loan in an amount\
  \ that (1) exceeds the borrower’s eligibility, (2) that cannot supported through\
  \ documentation, or (3) that was not used for purposes permitted by statute or guidance.\
  \  In its review of the loan, if SBA determines that the loan is not eligible for\
  \ forgiveness (in whole or in part), the borrower must begin paying principal and\
  \ interest.\n"

detail_exs1: "In FY 2022, the SBA reviewed seven programs and activities that were\
  \ deemed susceptible to significant improper payments. Additionally, the SBA conducted\
  \ a risk assessment for an additional 20 programs, with all 20 programs identified\
  \ as being not susceptible to significant improper payments. \nFrom FY 2021 to FY\
  \ 2022, SBA added three new programs to the total number of programs reporting improper\
  \ payment estimates.  The three new programs are all COVID-19 pandemic related programs,\
  \ added as a result of new legislation. \nOf the seven programs reporting improper\
  \ payment data, the most prominent root cause identified was related to the statutory\
  \ requirements of the program not being met.  The other root cause identified relates\
  \ to the failure to access data and/or information needed.  \nThe SBA’s business\
  \ model of delegating approval authority to lenders to process loans and evaluate\
  \ an applicants eligibility for the loans directly relates to the root cause of\
  \ the improper payments.  As such, some of the corrective action plans developed\
  \ to address the improper payments include working with lenders to ensure statutory\
  \ requirements are understood and implemented, collaborating with other offices\
  \ within the SBA to monitor lender deficiencies, and requesting and obtaining any\
  \ missing documentation in a timely manner.  To ensure root causes are addressed,\
  \ the SBA has developed rigorous corrective action plans to ensure timely remediation\
  \ of any improper payments identified."
