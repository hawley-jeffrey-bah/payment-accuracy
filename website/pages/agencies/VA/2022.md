detail_agy1: "VA has invested in payment integrity efforts where appropriate to prevent\
  \ improper payments from occurring.  This is evidenced by VA reporting four consecutive\
  \ years of reductions in improper payments – a reduction of $11.2 billion or 76%\
  \  These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total of seven programs from reporting\
  \ improper payments during this same timeframe.  Below are some of our highlights\
  \ on activities occurring across the Department to ensure that taxpayer dollars\
  \ are spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations promise to its Veterans.\n\n\
  Veterans Health Administration\nVeterans Health Administration attributes the significant\
  \ reduction in and prevention of improper payments over the last four years to agency-specific\
  \ efforts such as the development of 50 plus business rules and artificial intelligence\
  \ built into the claims processing system that allows claims that meet all rules\
  \ to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. Improper payments are identified\
  \ on a continual (real-time) basis in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout\
  \ the life-cycle of a claim from when the medical provider/third party administrator\
  \ submits the claim, the claim processing through the VA source system and into\
  \ VA's Program Integrity Tool, and then back to the VA source system for payment\
  \ and adjudication. Pre-payment control logic includes, but is not limited to, duplicate\
  \ checks, aberrant billing patterns, and List of Excluded Individuals and Entities.\n\
  \nVeterans Benefits Administration\nAs part of Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal and external activities outside of\
  \ the Treasury Working System are in place that focus on the prevention of overpayments.\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration receives continuous information from several\
  \ Federal agencies, which it uses to verify the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries.\
  \ This information identifies instances where there may be inconsistencies between\
  \ VA records and data furnished by other Federal agencies that may affect entitlement\
  \ to Compensation and Pension benefits. The following describes the various agreements:\n\
  \n1) Fugitive Felon Match - The Office of Inspector General entered into a computer\
  \ matching agreement with law enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with\
  \ felony arrest warrants to match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries\
  \ that might be fugitive felons. \n\n2) Social Security Verification Match - Once\
  \ a year, the Social Security Administration provides information on Social Security\
  \ Administration rates for recipients of VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and\
  \ Indemnity Compensation to verify reported income.\n\n3) Social Security Administration\
  \ Prison Match - The Social Security Administration provide VA with Information\
  \ on prisoners. Periodically, data from Compensation and Pension records are run\
  \ against Social Security's inmate database to identify VA beneficiaries who may\
  \ be subject to reduction or termination of benefits. The Bureau of Prisons Match\
  \ provides Veterans Benefits Administration with information on Federal prisoners.\
  \ On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension files are matched with Bureau of\
  \ Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated beneficiaries, which may require\
  \ a reduction of termination of benefits. The Social Security Death Master File\
  \ from the Social Security Administration provides VA a list of deceased individuals.\
  \ On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension records are matched with the Death\
  \ Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries to determine if benefits\
  \ need to be terminated. \n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial Services Center\
  \ leverages data available within the Treasury Working System via Computer Matching\
  \ Agreements with the United States Department of Treasury to continually update\
  \ the vendor file used to store payee information for individuals and vendors doing\
  \ business with VA.  Potential matches are identified in the file to be used if\
  \ invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and vendors in the future.\
  \ The Financial Services Center is continuing the partnership with the United States\
  \ Department of Treasury to utilize additional data that will improve customer service,\
  \ to include reducing the time it takes to validate new or changes to existing vendor\
  \ information. This partnership and use of data made available to the United States\
  \ Department of Treasury by various federal agencies will improve VA’s ability to\
  \ stop future potential improper payments in a pre-payment state."

detail_ara2_1: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
  \ therefore, many programs' payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
  \ using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in\
  \ five major areas: Veterans Health Administration for several unique programs providing\
  \ health care, Veterans Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial\
  \ Services Center in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial\
  \ Services Center which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which\
  \ includes Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for\
  \ example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office\
  \ of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well\
  \ as specific recovery audits performed by the Office of Inspector General's additional\
  \ shared service providers for payroll and Supply Fund payments in the Office of\
  \ Revolving Fund. These are discussed in more detail below.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\
  Veterans Health Administration is operationalizing a recovery audit contract which\
  \ will audit claims from FY 2018 through FY 2023 for Civilian Health and Medical\
  \ Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration\
  \ Spina Bifida Health Care, and VA Community Care programs. The review includes\
  \ inpatient claims paid under the following authorities: 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized\
  \ care); 38 U.S.C. § 1728 (service connected unauthorized care); and 38 U.S.C. §\
  \ 1725 (non-service connected emergency care) and will test to ensure the care rendered\
  \ is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based on the\
  \ appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic related\
  \ group billed for the services.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\nVeterans Benefits\
  \ Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify\
  \ possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility\
  \ determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs,\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential\
  \ duplicate payments and other potential improper payments. Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined\
  \ efforts of the multiple VA Offices.\n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial\
  \ Services Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required\
  \ recovery audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration,\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices. VA Staff Offices include\
  \ but are not limited to the Office of Inspector General, Office of Acquisition\
  \ Logistics and Construction, Office of Human Resources & Administration, Office\
  \ of Information Technology, and Office of Management.\n\nThe Financial Services\
  \ Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments\
  \ for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million\
  \ or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments\
  \ in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate\
  \ payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial\
  \ Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified\
  \ improper payments.\n\nOffice of Inspector General\nFor improper payments that\
  \ originate with payroll services, the Office of Inspector General works with two\
  \ Office of Management and Budget Human Resources Lines of Business Shared Services\
  \ Providers for its recovery audit requirements: the Bureau of Fiscal Services (Department\
  \ of Treasury/Bureau of Fiscal Services), and the National Finance Center (Department\
  \ of Agriculture/National Finance Center). Payroll overpayments and debt can arise\
  \ for a variety of reasons including salary overpayments due to corrected timecards\
  \ or personnel actions, debts arising from health and life insurance premiums or\
  \ “buy backs” of employee leave, and administrative debts at the request of the\
  \ agency.  The Bureau of Fiscal Services will automatically recalculate employee\
  \ pay to recover overpayments related to corrected timecards and personnel actions.\
  \ This process includes a Notification of Salary Overpayment to current employees\
  \ and a Demand for Payment Notice to separated employees. The National Finance Center\
  \ leads recovery efforts for overpayments that arise for all other reasons. If these\
  \ efforts are unsuccessful, the debt is transferred to the United States Department\
  \ of Treasury debt management for collection.\n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\nThe\
  \ Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to\
  \ perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General\
  \ identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office\
  \ of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses\
  \ to dispute the bill of collection VA will work towards appropriate resolution.\
  \ \n\n"
detail_ara2_2: VA reported overpayments identified in recovery audits that were determined
  not collectable. After exhausting all avenues to recover identified overpayments,
  including offsets, referrals to the Debt Management Center, and referrals to the
  Treasury Offset Program, the reported amount has been deemed uncollectable. For
  example, unique circumstances for approved waivers may determine the debt uncollectable.
detail_ara2_3: VA programs that have determined that it is not cost-effective to conduct
  recovery audits have documented their justifications through a cost benefit analyses
  that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. For FY 2022, VA had six
  programs that determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits.
  Qualitative factors considered elements such as the likelihood that identified overpayments
  would be recaptured, the likelihood that the expected recoveries would be greater
  than the costs incurred to identify overpayments, and the degree to which the information
  systems and other infrastructure contributed to the cost effectiveness of overpayment
  recoveries. Quantitative factors included the analysis of categorized recovery amounts
  versus the costs to determine if the benefits of establishing a payment recapture
  audit program would exceed the costs associated with recovery of overpayments. Each
  of the six programs determined that conducting a recovery audit would not be cost-effective
  due to the quantitative costs of the related recovery audit outweighing the collectable
  overpayments and the qualitative analysis concluded that it is not likely that identified
  overpayments would be recaptured.
detail_ara2_3_2: For FY 2022, the six VA programs that determined it would not be
  cost-effective to conduct recovery audits are Education (Chapter 1607), Education
  (Reporting Fees), Education (State Approving Agencies), Loan Guaranty (Loan Production),
  Specially Adaptive Housing, and Equal Access to Justice.

detail_arp16: '43.12'
detail_arp16_5: '0.01'
detail_arp17: Overpayments identified in recovery audits are predominantly due to
  duplicate payments, non-compliance with contract billing requirements on federal
  supply schedule contracts, corrected timecards or personnel actions, processing
  dependency claims and due process, and discrepancies involving beneficiaries' income.
  These conditions are being resolved by implementing corrective actions utilizing
  mitigation strategies and corrective actions that are appropriate to the severity
  of the error. Examples include education and increased automation meant to identify
  and stop duplicate payments before they are made.
detail_arp18: 'Although VA has instituted payment integrity controls meant to identify
  overpayments before they occur, not all overpayments can be prevented. Therefore,
  VA implements appropriate recovery activities and audits based on the specifics
  of the program. The majority of VA''s programs conduct recovery audits versus recovery
  activities.


  VA''s recovery response is provided at the agency level based on an aggregate of
  program specific data. As a result, individual program responses may not be reflective
  of the overall agency response. For example, while VA responded yes to recovery
  activities, only 21 of 88 programs performed recovery activities in addition to
  recovery audits. In addition, some recoveries identified by Office of Management
  and Budget implementation guidance as activities versus recovery audits are so minimal
  throughout a fiscal year that it would not be cost beneficial to break these out
  and track separately, therefore, these are included in recovery audit reporting
  and recovery disposition aligns with recovery audit disposition requirements. Examples
  include overpayments identified during annual Payment Integrity Information Act
  of 2019 testing for programs reporting improper and unknown payments, recoveries
  from Qui Tam cases where VA does not receive notification from the Department of
  Justice that these recoveries were from a Qui Tam case, and some self-reported overpayments.
  Also, although the majority of VA’s programs are part of the Recovery Audit program
  facilitated by the Financial Services Center that has a recovery target of 80%,
  some programs have differing targets dependent upon specifics related to their programs.


  In addition, VA totals for the disposition of funds are able to be reconciled to
  the recovery audit amount for the reporting period; however, recovery audit overpayments
  identified in the current reporting period that remain outstanding for zero to six
  months or six months to one year may not reconcile to the difference in the amount
  identified and amount recovered for the current reporting period. This is a result
  of the amount recovered in the current reporting period including overpayments identified
  both within the reporting period and from prior reporting periods.'

detail_dpa5: VA is actively engaged with Treasury on improvements to the Treasury
  Working System which VA believes will enable the prevention of improper payments
  in the future.  However, currently, VA is only able to use the Treasury Working
  System to confirm improper payments after they are made and prevent future improper
  payments once due process is provided. There is not currently a report available
  to quantify these results.
detail_exs1: "For FY 2022, VA is reporting a total of $3.5 billion in projected improper\
  \ and unknown payments across 7 programs in Phase 2: Beneficiary Travel; Communications,\
  \ Utilities, and Other Rent; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased\
  \ Long Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care.\
  \ Specifically, VA reports $1.4 billion in monetary loss, $1.56 billion in nonmonetary\
  \ loss improper payments ($1.7 million in underpayments, $1.56 billion in technically\
  \ improper), and $550.42 million in unknown payments. In addition, the Purchased\
  \ Long Term Services and Supports program is reporting monetary loss under $100\
  \ million in FY 2022, removing it from high priority program reporting requirements\
  \ in FY 2023. VA’s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of $1.6\
  \ billion or 32% from FY 2021 results. It is also important to note that VA efforts\
  \ to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced outlay increases of $3.2 billion,\
  \ or 11%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. In addition,\
  \ for FY 2022, VA is reporting 67 programs in Phase 1 with 47 programs requiring\
  \ an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Each of these programs, or 100%,\
  \ were determined below significant risk of improper and unknown payment thresholds,\
  \ defined as either 1.5% of outlays and at least $10 million or $100 million or\
  \ more in total improper and unknown payments.\n\nVA has made great progress in\
  \ the reduction of improper payments and unknown payments. Since FY 2018, VA has\
  \ reduced improper and unknown payments by $11.24 billion, or 76% and removed a\
  \ total of 7 programs from reporting requirements, utilizing mitigation strategies\
  \ and corrective actions that prioritized the largest proportion of errors and noncompliance\
  \ with laws and regulations. For FY 2022, 6 of 7 VA programs experienced a reduction\
  \ with only one program reporting increases. A major contributor to the agency’s\
  \ overall decrease was within the VA Community Care program. The program reduced\
  \ overpayments related to incorrect billing vendor and payment processing errors\
  \ by $1.01 billion from the previous fiscal year by implementing new software to\
  \ automate eligibility determinations and improve payment processing. Reductions\
  \ to improper payments and unknown payments is attributed to VA’s robust process\
  \ to update corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and no less\
  \ than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately\
  \ prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper payments and unknown payments.\
  \ Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions reduced\
  \ or were properly designed to reduce improper payments and unknown payments using\
  \ set benchmarks for specific root causes.\n\nVA prioritizes addressing errors resulting\
  \ in monetary loss, a total of $1.4 billion, or 40% of reported improper and unknown\
  \ payments in FY 2022. VA’s highest contributor of monetary losses within and outside\
  \ of VA’s control occurred within the Pension program due to unreported Social Security\
  \ Administration income resulting in incorrect payment amounts. These errors accounted\
  \ for $398.22 million, or 11% of VA’s total improper payments and unknown payments.\
  \ VA implemented an automated match with Social Security Administration to identify\
  \ differences in income amounts between social security benefits reported by beneficiaries\
  \ and social security benefits per Social Security Administration records. Starting\
  \ September 2022, a large batch of claims identified by the match is sent weekly\
  \ to claims processors for review and corrective action to include correction of\
  \ award amounts and recovery of overpayments, if applicable. The VA match with Social\
  \ Security Administration will also contribute to the mitigation of payment discrepancies\
  \ outside of VA's control. \n\nAdditional major causes of VA improper payments and\
  \ unknown payments in FY 2022 stemmed from technically improper payments which accounted\
  \ for $1.56 billion, or 44%, of VA’s total improper payments and unknown payments.\
  \ Of the $1.56 billion, approximately $1.02 billion, or 66%, did not meet procurement\
  \ or statutory requirements because orders were placed by unauthorized individuals\
  \ or VA was unable to obtain written documentation to support the ordering officer\
  \ delegation. To remediate these technically improper payments, VA continues to\
  \ implement process and policy updates to mitigate unauthorized commitments and\
  \ utilize allowable contracts and agreements to improve compliance."
