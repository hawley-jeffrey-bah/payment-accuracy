  - Barriers: A known barrier to reductions is the reliance upon beneficiaries to
      report when they experience a change in receiving benefits from other sources,
      as this is an important factor in determining continued eligibility for benefits.
      When VA identifies a potential change for the beneficiary that could impact
      their Pension benefit, VA must provide the beneficiary advance notice, known
      as due process, to provide additional documentation. The due process period
      protects the beneficiary from reduction adjustments being made to their pension
      payments without validation of the data. Therefore, VA must continue to make
      the pension payment at the higher rate and does not know if the payment at the
      lower rate is accurate or not until due process is complete.
    Info: 'A beneficiary must provide accurate and current income information to VA.
      If a beneficiary does not timely inform VA of receiving benefits from other
      sources an improper payment may result. In addition, VA is required to validate
      a beneficiary''s Social Security Administration income information prior to
      finalizing a beneficiary''s award.


      Criteria for Receiving Benefits from Other Sources status requirements can be
      found in Code of Federal Regulations: Computation of income (3.271), Exclusions
      from income (3.272), Rate computation (3.273), Eligibility reporting requirements
      (3.277), Deductible medical expenses (3.278), and Statutory exclusions from

Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The FY 2024 risk assessment methodology included several
    updates to improve the reliability of the risk assessment results while ensuring
    each VA program assesses risk independently from other VA programs. Updates included
    ensuring that programs could provide input to the overall risk score if it was
    known that the program had improper and unknown payments exceeding the statutory
    thresholds of 1.5% and $10 million or $100 million.

detail_CAP5: 'In May 2024, the VA Office of Inspector General found 71 VA programs
  fully compliant with PIIA. The Office of Inspector General found two programs noncompliant
  with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pension and Purchased Long Term
  Services and Supports.


  The Pension program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving
  an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. VA''s Inspector General
  recommended that the Pension program reduce improper and unknown payments to below
  10%. The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
  and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although the Pension program
  remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall improper and unknown payments,
  the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will improve its ability to reduce
  improper and unknown payments in the future. This included updating testing procedures
  to correctly differentiate monetary loss from unknown payments, increasing detail
  obtained during testing to improve development of effective corrective actions,
  and improving corrective actions planned for FY 2025. Actions planned regarding
  automation include continuing quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration
  to identify variances between Social Security Administration income a beneficiary
  is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate
  potential changes in a beneficiary’s income, which could require a change to their
  pension benefit. Validating whether a change is needed and making changes, if necessary,
  prevents future improper payments. Ensuring accurate documentation of Social Security
  Administration income prevents future improper payments. Actions planned regarding
  audit include randomly reviewing claims processors’ work to ensure policies and
  procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent
  future improper payments. Actions planned regarding training include training staff
  to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension
  rate decision to prevent future improper payments. Given the time it takes to implement
  corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued
  positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office
  of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity
  Information Act of 2019 in May 2027. The Pension program tracks the measurable milestones
  included in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal
  year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate
  risks of improper and unknown payments.


  In addition, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program was found noncompliant
  with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment rate
  of less than 10%. The Office of Inspector General recommended that the Purchased
  Long Term Services and Supports program reduce improper and unknown payments to
  below 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to prioritize
  and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
  improper and unknown payments. Although the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports
  program remains noncompliant, the impact of the program changes in recent years
  is reflected in a decrease in the improper and unknown payment rate from 38.72%
  in FY2023 to 13.52% (for a 25.2% reduction) and a $657.90 million decrease in improper
  payments in FY 2024, despite increases in program spending. Actions planned regarding
  automation include updating the claims processing system to pay Bowel and Bladder
  and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions planned regarding change
  process include moving to a standardized rate schedule for Community Nursing Home
  payments in order to transition from a legacy system to an automated claims adjudication
  system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party
  administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates, and will work to implement
  short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to
  improve compliance with procurement requirements. Further, VA will resolve contracting
  requirements involving missing signatures and inability to reconcile procurement
  vendor to invoice vendor, and will establish Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate.
  Actions planned regarding training include working internally with facilities to
  provide education and training to resolve missing documentation related to authorization,
  payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process. Given the time
  it takes to implement corrective actions and mitigation strategies, the program
  expects the continued positive impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates
  the Office of Inspector General will determine the program compliant with the Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019 in May 2028. The Purchased Long Term Services
  and Supports program tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective
  action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions
  planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper
  and unknown payments.'
detail_agy1: "VA has invested in payment integrity efforts, where appropriate, to\
  \ prevent improper payments from occurring. This is evidenced by VA reporting its\
  \ sixth consecutive year of reductions in improper and unknown payments – a reduction\
  \ of about $1 billion or 32%. These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total\
  \ of seven programs from reporting improper and unknown payments during this same\
  \ timeframe. In FY 2025, VA will also remove the Communications, Utilities and Other\
  \ Rents program from reporting improper and unknown payment reporting requirements\
  \ due to its reporting under the statutory thresholds. Below are some highlighted\
  \ activities occurring across the Department to ensure that taxpayer dollars are\
  \ spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations promise to its Veterans.\n\nVeterans\
  \ Health Administration\nVeterans Health Administration has developed effective\
  \ internal controls to identify potential improper payments on a continual (real-time)\
  \ basis in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout the life cycle of a claim\
  \ from when the medical provider/third party administrator submits the claim, to\
  \ the claim processing through the VA source system, and when the claim is issued\
  \ for payment and adjudication. Significant reduction in and prevention of improper\
  \ and unknown payments over the last six years are attributed to the development\
  \ of proactive business rules built into the claims processing systems that allows\
  \ claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human intervention. Artificial\
  \ intelligence and pre-payment control logic is also built in and includes, but\
  \ is not limited to, duplicate checks, aberrant billing patterns, coding and billing\
  \ errors, and checks against the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities. Additional\
  \ checks include service, equipment, or drugs not covered; charge exceeds the maximum\
  \ allowable rate; or the provider was not certified/eligible to be paid for the\
  \ procedure/service on the date of service.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\n\
  As part of Veterans Benefits Administration Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal\
  \ and external activities outside of the Treasury Working System are in place that\
  \ focus on the prevention of overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration receives\
  \ continuous information from several Federal agencies, which it uses to verify\
  \ the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. This information identifies instances\
  \ where there may be inconsistencies between VA records and data furnished by other\
  \ Federal agencies that may affect entitlement to Compensation and Pension benefits.\
  \ The following describes the various agreements:\n\nFugitive Felon Match - The\
  \ Office of Inspector General entered into a computer matching agreement with law\
  \ enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with felony arrest warrants to\
  \ match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries that might be fugitive felons.\n\
  \nSocial Security Verification Match - Quarterly, the Social Security Administration\
  \ provides information on Social Security Administration rates for recipients of\
  \ VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation to verify reported\
  \ income.\n\nSocial Security Administration Prison Match - The Social Security Administration\
  \ provides VA with information on prisoners. Periodically, data from Compensation\
  \ and Pension records are run against Social Security's inmate database to identify\
  \ VA beneficiaries who may be subject to reduction or termination of benefits.\n\
  \nThe Bureau of Prisons Match - Provides Veterans Benefits Administration with information\
  \ on Federal prisoners. On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension files are matched\
  \ with Bureau of Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated beneficiaries,\
  \ which may require a reduction of termination of benefits.\n\nThe Social Security\
  \ Death Master File - The Social Security Administration provides VA a list of deceased\
  \ individuals. On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension records are matched with\
  \ the Death Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries to determine\
  \ if benefits need to be terminated.  \n\nThe Federal Tax Information Match – Weekly,\
  \ the Internal Revenue Service provides income and net worth information. Claimant\
  \ records who are initially applying for VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and\
  \ Indemnity Compensation are matched to verify reported income and assets.  \n\n\
  Financial Services Center\nThe Financial Services Center (FSC) leverages data available\
  \ within the Treasury Working System via Computer Matching Agreements with Treasury\
  \ to continually update the vendor file used to store payee information for individuals\
  \ and vendors doing business with VA. Potential matches are identified in the file\
  \ and will be used if invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and\
  \ vendors in the future. The FSC is continuing the partnership with Treasury to\
  \ utilize additional data that will improve customer service, to include reducing\
  \ the time it takes to validate new vendors or changes to existing vendor information.\
  \ This partnership and use of data made available to Treasury by various federal\
  \ agencies will improve VA’s ability to stop future potential improper payments\
  \ in a pre-payment state.\n\nAdditionally, FSC reviews prepayments scheduled for\
  \ future payment for all customer field stations against any other scheduled payments\
  \ and payment history daily. FSC utilizes the Invoice Payment Processing System\
  \ and Business Activity Monitoring system as part of the invoice review process,\
  \ and the data sources contain business rules designed to assist with the identification\
  \ and prevention of improper payments. Payments determined to be duplicates are\
  \ denied before the payment is disbursed."

  \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
  \ using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail below.\n\
  \nVeterans Health Administration\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration utilizes\
  \ a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian Health and\
  \ Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community Care, and\
  \ Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the reimbursement\
  \ was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical records support\

  \ also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United States Code § 1703 (authorized\
  \ care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral.\n\
  \nVeterans Benefits Administration\n\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration uses\
  \ a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates\
  \ and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform\
  \ quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations,\
  \ proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans\
  \ Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate\
  \ payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks,\
  \ monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts\
  \ of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center,\
  \ and Regional Offices. \n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\n\nThe Office of Revolving\
  \ Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits\
  \ on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment\
  \ and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with\
  \ appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of\
  \ collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution."

detail_ara2_3: VA programs that have determined that it is not cost-effective to conduct
  recovery audits have documented their justifications through a cost benefit analysis.
  For FY 2024, VA had 64 programs where conducting recovery audits would not be cost-effective.
  Whenever possible, VA utilizes quantitative factors, such as recovery amounts and
  actual costs incurred in recovery audits to determine if the benefits of a payment
  recovery audit program would exceed the costs associated with identification and
  recovery of overpayments. Lacking full quantitative data, VA will also utilize qualitative
  factors to determine if the benefits of a payment recovery audit program would exceed
  the costs associated with identification and recovery of overpayments. Qualitative
  factors evaluate the likelihood that identified overpayments would be recovered
  and the likelihood that the expected recoveries would be greater than the costs
  incurred to identify and recover overpayments. Each of the 64 programs determined
  that conducting a recovery audit would not be cost effective due to the costs or
  expected costs of the related recovery audit outweighing the collectable overpayments.

detail_dpa5: VA fulfills the requirements of the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative and reviews
  payments against Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) required databases. VA
  utilizes the Treasury Working Systems (TWS) as appropriate. VA utilizes the TWS
  payment integration functionality. Payment integration consists of matching payments
  against available TWS data sources at the time of disbursement. Specifically, VA
  submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to the Department of Treasury
  for matching against the TWS data sources. The Department of Treasury uses DNP to
  perform matching of PAM Payments to TWS data sources and provides a PAM count of
  stopped payments and/or count of matched payments. The TWS match results are available
  in the TWS the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results
  and review and adjudication of TWS matches are performed in accordance with VA processes
  and procedures. There are two reports available for download in the TWS. The Payment
  Activity Report (PAR) provides VA a summary of the PAM payments, matches, and adjudication
  statuses. The Adjudication Summary report provides VA the summary adjudication status
  results each month. VA adjudicates matches within the TWS on a monthly basis. Therefore,
  VA is only able to use the TWS to confirm improper payments after the payment has
  been already made and prevent future improper payments once due process is provided
  for payment integration. In addition, VA utilizes single search and continuous monitoring
  when appropriate, unless other already established processes outside the TWS exists.
  Reports are not currently available from TWS on the results of single search and
  continuous monitoring.
detail_exs1: "VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper and unknown\
  \ payments as it continues to implement Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019\
  \ (PIIA) requirements. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments\
  \ by $12.6 billion, or 85% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements,\
  \ utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest\
  \ proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. In FY 2024,\
  \ VA is also pleased to announce that the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents\
  \ program is reporting under the statutory thresholds and will be removed from reporting\
  \ requirements in FY 2025.\n\nPIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs\
  \ and activities with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment\
  \ risk at least once every 3 years to identify those susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments. In addition, VA conducts off-cycle improper payment risk assessments\
  \ when a significant change in legislation and/or a significant change in funding\
  \ occurs as required by Office of Management and Budget. For FY 2024, VA is reporting\
  \ 65 programs subject to risk assessment requirements with 24 programs completing\
  \ an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Of these, 23 programs, or 96%,\
  \ were determined unlikely to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments,\
  \ defined as $10 million and 1.5% of outlays or $100 million in total. The Compensation\
  \ program improper payment risk assessment results determined the program is likely\
  \ to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments. As a result, the Compensation\
  \ program will report a statistically valid projection in FY 2025. In addition,\
  \ in accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidance, 3 new programs identified\
  \ during FY 2024 will initiate the 3-year risk assessment cycle early in FY 2025.\n\
  \nFor those programs determined to be at risk of significant improper and unknown\
  \ payments in the previous year, PIIA requires agencies to follow OMB implementation\
  \ guidance for testing, reporting, and remediating improper and unknown payments.\
  \ For FY 2024, VA is reporting a total of $2.2 billion in projected improper and\
  \ unknown payments across 7 programs: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities,\
  \ and Other Rents; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long\
  \ Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically,\
  \ VA reports $1.1 billion in monetary loss, $731.5 million in non-monetary loss\
  \ improper payments ($32.6 million in underpayments, $698.9 million in technically\
  \ improper), and $328.0 million in unknown payments. From FY 2023 to FY 2024, VA\
  \ is reporting a reduction in monetary loss of $681.6 million or 38%. VA’s reported\
  \ improper and unknown payments is a reduction of about $1 billion or 32% from FY\
  \ 2023 results and is VA’s sixth consecutive year of reported reductions. It is\
  \ important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced\
  \ overall outlay increases of $4.4 billion in FY 2024, or 12%, due to effective\
  \ corrective actions and mitigation strategies.                                \
  \                              \n\nFor FY 2024, 4 VA programs (Communications, Utilities,\
  \ and Other Rents, Medical Care Contracts and Agreements, Purchased Long Term Services\
  \ and Supports, and VA Community Care) achieved a reduction in their improper and\
  \ unknown payment rates and amounts. The remaining 3 programs (Beneficiary Travel,\
  \ Pension, and Supplies and Materials) reported an increase; however, these programs\
  \ did make improvements in FY 2024 that will reduce future improper and unknown\
  \ payments. Reductions to overall improper and unknown payments is attributed to\
  \ VA’s robust process to update corrective action plans annually based on testing\
  \ results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions\
  \ are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown\
  \ payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions\
  \ reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments using\
  \ set benchmarks for specific root causes.\n\nIn FY 2024, VA’s highest contributors\
  \ of monetary losses were within VA’s control and occurred when programs failed\
  \ to access the data/information needed to validate correct beneficiary award amounts\
  \ or that claims were paid in accordance with contract rates. These errors accounted\
  \ for $594.8 million, or 27% of VA’s total improper and unknown payments. To remediate\
  \ these errors, VA will continue to implement actions that include identifying variances\
  \ between reported Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving\
  \ versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, VA will clarify\
  \ payment methodology, ensure that invoices are paid per the contract pricing, and\
  \ implement system updates to ensure claims are paid appropriately. \n\nIn FY 2024,\
  \ VA's highest contributor of technically improper payments did not meet statutory\
  \ or regulatory requirements because purchases were made without a contract utilizing\
  \ a Basic Ordering Agreement or VA was missing written documentation to support\
  \ ordering officer delegations. These errors accounted for $511.9 million, or 24%\
  \ of VA's total improper and unknown payments. To remediate these errors, VA will\
  \ continue to implement short- and long-term contracting options to improve compliance\
  \ with procurement requirements and will improve contract processes to ensure payment\
  \ accuracy.\n\nIn FY 2024, VA’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was\
  \ noncompliant with PIIA. VA was noncompliant because the improper and unknown payment\
  \ rate in two programs, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, was\
  \ greater than 10%. The Pension program will conduct quarterly matches with the\
  \ Social Security Administration to identify variances in income amounts between\
  \ Social Security income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported\
  \ by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, the program will randomly review claims processors’\
  \ work and train staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in\
  \ making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. The\
  \ Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program plans to move to a standardized\
  \ rate schedule to transition Community Nursing Home payments to an automated claims\
  \ processing system; update the claims processing system to pay claims appropriately;\
  \ continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill\
  \ at the correct rates; continue implementing short- and long-term contracting options\
  \ for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements;\
  \ and provide education and training to resolve missing documentation errors. The\
  \ agency anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the Pension\
  \ program compliant in May 2027 and the PLTSS program compliant in May 2028."

detail_pcp14: In accordance with The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA),
  VA’s Inspector General is required to provide recommendations for actions to further
  improve prevention and reduction of improper and unknown payments within each program
  reporting above the statutory threshold regardless of compliance status. VA had
  2 programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold and the Inspector General
  recommended reducing improper and unknown payments to below 10% for both programs.
  The Inspector General did not provide a statement on the programs’ tolerable improper
  and unknown payment rate status.

detail_raa9: The FY 2024 risk assessment methodology included several updates to improve
  the reliability of the risk assessment results while ensuring each VA program assesses
  risk independently from other VA programs. Updates included ensuring that programs
  could provide input to the overall risk score if it was known that the program had
  improper and unknown payments exceeding the statutory thresholds of 1.5% and $10
  million or $100 million.
