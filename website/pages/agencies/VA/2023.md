      proof of dependency along with other documentation if requested. Criteria for
      dependency status requirements can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations:
      Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans'' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans
      Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and
      Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Marriage (3.205), Surviving

      Marriage dates (3.54), and Duty periods (3.60).'
    Theme: Dependency
  - Barriers: 'There are regulatory barriers prohibiting the VA from improving prevention
      of improper payments by matching data with financial criteria. $24.47 million
      of this program''s improper payments are from data needed that does not exist
      to validate financial requirement eligibility of a beneficiary prior to payment.
      Beneficiaries are the sole source for medical expenses so the data does not
      exist within any other agency for VA to access. Code of Federal Regulations:
      Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans'' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans
      Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and
      Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Computation of income (3.271)
      allow beneficiaries to provide revised medical expenses to VA after payments
      are made and regulations require VA to make applicable retroactive adjustments
      to benefit payments. $9.47 million of this program''s improper payments are
      from inability to access data needed to validate the financial requirement eligibility
      of a beneficiary prior to payment. Specifically, overpayments occur when Social
      Security benefits are increased as the result of a Social Security cost-of-living
      adjustment and the Pension maximum annual rates are increased by a like percentage
      at the same time, in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions,
      Bonuses, and Veterans'' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter
      One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and
      Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Improved pension rates (3.23). The effective
      date of Social Security Administration and Pension cost-of-living adjustments
      is December 1; which are paid January 1. VA is unable to prevent these overpayments
      from occurring because VA is unable to access the ‘post cost-of-living adjustment’
      Social Security Administration income amount data at the time in which VA makes
      its cost-of-living adjustment changes in December for the January Pension payments.'
    Info: 'VA is required to validate Veterans wartime service and claimant financial
      status (income, applicable deductible expenses, and net-worth) prior to making
      payment. Claimant income and net-worth must not exceed VA applicable maximum
      annual pension rate or net-worth limits to meet the financial status requirements.
      Criteria for financial status requirements can be found in Code of Federal Regulations:
      Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans'' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans
      Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and

detail_agy1: "VA has invested in payment integrity efforts, where appropriate, to\
  \ prevent improper payments from occurring.  This is evidenced by VA reporting five\
  \ consecutive years of reductions in improper and unknown payments – a reduction\
  \ of $11.6 billion or 79%.  These efforts have also allowed VA to remove a total\
  \ of seven programs from reporting improper and unknown payments during this same\
  \ timeframe.  Below are some highlighted activities occurring across the Department\
  \ to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent as intended and VA fulfills this nations\
  \ promise to its Veterans.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\nVeterans Health Administration\
  \ attributes the significant reduction in and prevention of improper and unknown\
  \ payments over the last five years to agency-specific efforts such as the development\
  \ of 50 plus business rules and artificial intelligence built into the claims processing\
  \ system that allows claims that meet all rules to auto-adjudicate without human\
  \ intervention. Improper payments are identified on a continual (real-time) basis\
  \ in multiple systems at multiple levels throughout the life-cycle of a claim from\
  \ when the medical provider/third party administrator submits the claim, to the\
  \ claim processing through the VA source system and into VA's Program Integrity\
  \ Tool, and then back to the VA source system for payment and adjudication. Pre-payment\
  \ control logic includes, but is not limited to, duplicate checks, aberrant billing\
  \ patterns, coding and billing errors, and the List of Excluded Individuals and\
  \ Entities.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\nAs part of Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ Do Not Pay - Activities, multiple internal and external activities outside of\
  \ the Treasury Working System are in place that focus on the prevention of overpayments.\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration receives continuous information from several\
  \ Federal agencies, which it uses to verify the status of Veterans Affairs beneficiaries.\
  \ This information identifies instances where there may be inconsistencies between\
  \ VA records and data furnished by other Federal agencies that may affect entitlement\
  \ to Compensation and Pension benefits. The following describes the various agreements:\n\
  \nFugitive Felon Match - The Office of Inspector General entered into a computer\
  \ matching agreement with law enforcement agencies for a list of individuals with\
  \ felony arrest warrants to match against VA records, identifying beneficiaries\
  \ that might be fugitive felons. \n\nSocial Security Verification Match - Quarterly,\
  \ the Social Security Administration provides information on Social Security Administration\
  \ rates for recipients of VA Pension and Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation\
  \ to verify reported income.\n\nSocial Security Administration Prison Match - The\
  \ Social Security Administration provides VA with information on prisoners. Periodically,\
  \ data from Compensation and Pension records are run against Social Security's inmate\
  \ database to identify VA beneficiaries who may be subject to reduction or termination\
  \ of benefits. \n\nThe Bureau of Prisons Match - Provides Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ with information on Federal prisoners. On a monthly basis, Compensation and Pension\
  \ files are matched with Bureau of Prisons' inmate database to identify incarcerated\
  \ beneficiaries, which may require a reduction of termination of benefits. \n\n\
  The Social Security Death Master File - The Social Security Administration provides\
  \ VA a list of deceased individuals. On a weekly basis, Compensation and Pension\
  \ records are matched with the Death Master File to identify possible deceased beneficiaries\
  \ to determine if benefits need to be terminated. \n\nFinancial Services Center\n\
  The Financial Services Center leverages data available within the Treasury Working\
  \ System via Computer Matching Agreements with Treasury to continually update the\
  \ vendor file used to store payee information for individuals and vendors doing\
  \ business with VA.  Potential matches are identified in the file and will be used\
  \ if invoices/claims are submitted from matched individuals and vendors in the future.\
  \ The Financial Services Center is continuing the partnership with Treasury to utilize\
  \ additional data that will improve customer service, to include reducing the time\
  \ it takes to validate new vendors or changes to existing vendor information. This\
  \ partnership and use of data made available to Treasury by various federal agencies\
  \ will improve VA’s ability to stop future potential improper payments in a pre-payment\
  \ state. \n\nAdditionally, FSC reviews prepayments scheduled for future payment\
  \ for all customer field stations against any other scheduled payments and payment\
  \ history daily. FSC utilizes the Invoice Payment Processing System (IPPS) and Business\
  \ Activity Monitoring system as part of the invoice review process, and the data\
  \ sources contain business rules designed to assist with the identification and\
  \ prevention of improper payments. Payments determined to be duplicates are denied\
  \ before the payment is disbursed."

detail_ara2_1: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
  \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
  \ using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in\
  \ five major areas: Veterans Health Administration through a recovery audit, Veterans\
  \ Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center\
  \ in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center\
  \ which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes Veterans\
  \ Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration payments,\
  \ National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices (for example,\
  \ Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the Office of Human\
  \ Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness), as well as specific\
  \ recovery audits performed for the Supply Fund payments in the Office of the Revolving\
  \ Fund.  These are discussed in more detail below.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\
  VHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the VACC program.\
  \ The review includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized\
  \ care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral;\
  \ was reimbursed based on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records\
  \ support the diagnostic related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery\
  \ audits being reported are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract.\
  \ \n                                                                           \
  \                    \nVeterans Benefits Administration\nVeterans Benefits Administration\
  \ uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible\
  \ duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility\
  \ determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs,\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential\
  \ duplicate payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration\
  \ tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined\
  \ efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting\
  \ Center, and Regional Offices.\n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial Services\
  \ Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery\
  \ audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration,\
  \ Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices.  The Financial Services\
  \ Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments\
  \ for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million\
  \ or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments\
  \ in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate\
  \ payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The Financial\
  \ Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection for identified\
  \ improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment was paid via electronic\
  \ funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter of indemnity to\
  \ recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction. In cases\
  \ where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the improper amount\
  \ was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical facilities process\
  \ a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds for the improper amount.\
  \ After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned the funds, requested\
  \ additional information, or disputed the bill of collection, an internal offset\
  \ is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued payment(s) to that\
  \ same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts to collect are unsuccessful,\
  \ FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt service program to collect\
  \ the funds from the next government issued payment(s) to the vendor or employee\
  \ until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs can include the Treasury Offset\
  \ Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing. Temporary changes to this process\
  \ can occur at the program’s request until a permanent alternative is identified\
  \ by the customer.\n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\nThe Office of Revolving Fund collaborates\
  \ with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply\
  \ Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a\
  \ bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate\
  \ terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans\
  \ Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution."

detail_ara2_3: VA programs that have determined that it is not cost-effective to conduct
  recovery audits have documented their justifications through a cost benefit analysis.
  For FY 2023, VA had 19 programs where conducting recovery audits would not be cost-effective.
  Whenever possible, VA utilizes quantitative factors, such as recovery amounts and
  actual costs incurred in recovery audits to determine if the benefits of a payment
  recovery audit program would exceed the costs associated with identification and
  recovery of overpayments. Lacking full quantitative data, VA will also utilize qualitative
  factors to determine if the benefits of a payment recovery audit program would exceed
  the costs associated with identification and recovery of overpayments. Qualitative
  factors evaluate the likelihood that identified overpayments would be recovered
  and the likelihood that the expected recoveries would be greater than the costs
  incurred to identify and recover overpayments. Each of the 19 programs determined
  that conducting a recovery audit would not be cost effective due to the costs or
  expected costs of the related recovery audit outweighing the collectable overpayments.

  \ VA utilizes the Treasury Working Systems (TWS) payment integration, continuous\

  \ available for download in the TWS for required reporting. The Payment Activity\
  \ Report (PAR) provides VA a summary of the PAM payments, matches, and adjudication\
  \ statuses. The Adjudication Summary report provides VA the summary adjudication\

  \ VA submits the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) file to Treasury for matching\
  \ against the TWS data sources. VA payments are matched against the TWS databases\
  \ at the time of disbursement and the TWS match results are available in the TWS\
  \ the next business day for adjudication. VA downloads TWS match results and review/adjudication\

detail_exs1: "VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper and unknown\
  \ payments as it continues to implement Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019\
  \ (PIIA) requirements. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments\
  \ by $11.6 billion, or 79% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements,\
  \ utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest\
  \ proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. \n\nPIIA requires\
  \ agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays\
  \ greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every three years\
  \ to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, VA\
  \ conducts off-cycle improper payment risk assessments when a significant change\
  \ in legislation and/or a significant change in funding occurs as required by Office\
  \ of Management and Budget.  For FY 2023, VA is reporting 66 programs in Phase 1\
  \ (subject to risk assessment requirements) with 30 programs completing an improper\
  \ and unknown payment risk assessment. Each of the 30 programs, or 100%, were determined\
  \ below significant risk of improper and unknown payment thresholds, defined as\
  \ $10 million and 1.5% of outlays or $100 million in total. \n\nLikewise, for those\
  \ programs determined to be at risk of significant improper and unknown payments,\
  \ PIIA requires Agencies to follow OMB implementation guidance for testing, reporting,\
  \ and remediating improper and unknown payments. For FY 2023, VA is reporting a\
  \ total of $3.2 billion in projected improper and unknown payments across 7 programs\
  \ in Phase 2: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities, and Other Rent; Medical\
  \ Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long Term Services and Supports;\
  \ Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically, VA reports $1.8 billion\
  \ in monetary loss, $1.2 billion in nonmonetary loss improper payments ($9 million\
  \ in underpayments, $1.2 billion in technically improper), and $191.3 million in\
  \ unknown payments. VA’s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of\
  \ $334 million or 10% from FY 2022 results and is VA’s fifth consecutive year of\
  \ reported reductions. It is important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper\
  \ and unknown payments outpaced overall outlay increases of $4.3 billion in FY 2023,\
  \ or 14%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies. \n\nFor\
  \ FY 2023, all 7 VA programs achieved a reduction in their improper and unknown\
  \ payment rates with 4 programs also reducing their improper and unknown payment\
  \ amounts. The remaining 3 programs were unable to overcome outlay increases, resulting\
  \ in an increase in their improper and unknown payment amounts despite improvements\
  \ evidenced by a reduction in rate. Reductions to overall improper and unknown payments\
  \ is attributed to VA’s robust process to update corrective action plans annually\
  \ based on testing results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year,\
  \ to ensure actions are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks\
  \ of improper and unknown payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually\
  \ to measure if actions reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper and\
  \ unknown payments using set benchmarks for specific root causes. \n\nIn FY 2023,\
  \ VA’s highest contributor of monetary losses were within VA’s control and occurred\
  \ when programs failed to validate invoice amounts were in accordance with contract\
  \ rates or services were eligible per regulatory or contractual requirements. These\
  \ errors accounted for $902.9 million, or 29% of VA’s total improper and unknown\
  \ payments. During FY 2023, VA implemented an action to update internal policies\
  \ ensuring the correct rates were paid. In FY 2024, VA will prioritize addressing\
  \ errors resulting in monetary loss. VA will continue to implement actions that\
  \ include clarifying payment methodology within VA, ensuring third party administrators\
  \ bill at the correct allowable rates and invoices are validated per contract pricing,\
  \ and identifying if system updates are needed to ensure claims are paid appropriately.\
  \ \n\nAdditional major causes of VA improper and unknown payments in FY 2023 stemmed\
  \ from technically improper payments which accounted for $1.2 billion, or 37%, of\
  \ VA’s total improper and unknown payments. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $958.4\
  \ million, or 81%, did not meet procurement or statutory requirements because orders\
  \ were placed by unauthorized individuals or VA was unable to obtain written documentation\
  \ to support the ordering officer delegation. To remediate these technically improper\
  \ payments, VA continues to implement process and policy updates to mitigate unauthorized\
  \ commitments and utilize allowable contracts and agreements to improve compliance.\
  \  \n\nIn FY 2023, VA’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was non-compliant\
  \ with PIIA. VA was noncompliant because the improper and unknown payment rate in\
  \ two programs, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, was greater\
  \ than 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program will work to determine\
  \ if system updates are needed to ensure claims are paid appropriately and invoices\
  \ are being validated per contract pricing prior to payment, implement short- and\
  \ long-term contracting options to improve compliance with procurement requirements,\
  \ and enforce contract requirements for third party administrators to bill at the\
  \ correct allowable rates. The Pension program continues to implement an automated\
  \ match with Social Security Administration to identify differences in income amounts\
  \ between social security benefits reported by beneficiaries and social security\
  \ benefits per Social Security Administration records. The agency anticipates that\
  \ the improper and unknown payment rate for both programs will be below 10% in FY\
  \ 2026 due to the implementation of effective corrective actions and mitigation\
  \ strategies."
