Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Federal Retirement Services
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The status of an annuitant's death may go unreported. RS relies on annuitant's
      family members and other sources for proof of death. The delayed receipt of
      proof and sometimes no proof of death can result in an improper payment.
    Info: 'The annuitant is only eligible for an annuity up until the date of death.
      The date of

      death or proof of death is required and is not always received timely.

      '
    Theme: Deceased
  - Barriers: A barrier prohibiting improving the prevention of improper payment is
      attrition. In addition, a lack of continuous funding is preventing RS from modernizing
      our current systems used to calculate benefits. However, RS leadership is currently
      working to prioritize and identify funding in FY 2024.
    Info: 'None of the predefined eligibility themes align with the reasons for Retirement

      Services underpayments. Therefore, placing underpayments in the predefined eligibility
      themes is not a fair representation of the OPM reasons for underpayments. However,
      from the options provided this category is the closest. The Retirement Services
      underpayments are a result of administrative/ process errors. OPM’s annuity
      calculations have automated and manual components. The manual components are
      subject to human error. Errors can include entering incorrect effective dates,
      salary rates, and/or tours of duty, which all impact annuity calculations. However,
      improving the education of Retirement Services staff internally remains the
      closest available proxy for underpayments.'

detail_dpa5: 'OPM''s FEHB, within Healthcare and Insurance, uses the Do Not Pay portal
  once a year, in February/March, to check new carrier applicants in the FEHB Program.  There
  was one new vendor in FY 2023 and OPM did not identify any incorrect information.


  OPM''s Retirement Services uses the Do Not Pay Initiative monthly in conjunction
  with other methods to determine if payments are proper and helps to reduce improper
  payments. OPM''s RS Fraud Analysts access the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal monthly, pulling
  nationally reported deaths of annuitants through the

  following death data sources: Department of State (DOS); Department of Defense (DOD);
  American Infosource (AIS) – Probate, American Infosource (AIS) -Obituary; the Electronic
  Verification of Vital Events-Fact of Death (EVVE-FOD); Payments, Claims, and Enhanced
  Reconciliations (PACER); and the public Death Master File (DMF). There were over
  25,000 hits/names/payments reviewed in FY 2023. All

  hits/names/payments were verified by Fraud Analysts through open and closed source
  investigative tools. In FY 2023, over 600 names were confirmed deceased and dropped
  for death, preventing over $1,000,000 in improper annuity payments from being issued.
  In addition, it is used to assist in providing verification of death to initiate
  reclamation of overpayments with OCFO and/or further criminal or civil prosecution
  by OIG on the estate.'
detail_exs1: "OPM is committed to advancing a transparent, accountable, and collaborative\
  \ financial management environment to fulfill its federal requirements and provide\
  \ stakeholders with accessible and actionable financial information. An essential\
  \ part of this commitment is the continuous improvement of payment accuracy in OPM’s\
  \ programs and robust internal controls. OPM continues to implement solutions to\
  \ prevent, detect, and reduce improper payments while reducing its stakeholders’\
  \ unnecessary administrative burden.  \n\nOPM's Inspector General concluded that\
  \ the agency was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)\
  \ in the most recent compliance audit.  \n\nPIIA requires the agency to review and\
  \ assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000\
  \ for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments.    OPM conducts improper payment risk assessments\
  \ on a three-year cycle, or more often if there are significant changes in the program.\
  \  In FY 2023 OPM conducted improper payments risk assessments for three programs.\
  \  One of those programs is now a phase 2 program due to the amount of program outlays.\
  \  OPM now has two phase 2 programs, one of these programs, Retirement Services\
  \ (RS) is reporting an improper payment estimate.  \n\nOPM's Retirement Services\
  \ improper and unknown rate is 0.38 percent.  The improper payment rate is 0.35\
  \ percent.  The tolerable rate is 0.38 percent. RS is aware of the improper payment\
  \ drivers; however, systemic limitations prevent RS from providing the survey's\
  \ requested level of specificity. OPM’s systems were not designed or built to perform\
  \ analyses of vast quantities of data.  There are overpayments that are the result\
  \ of annuitant's family members and other sources failing to report annuitant's\
  \ death.  However, as our on-going internal control activities, OPM conducts surveys\
  \ and matches to mitigate potential improper payments resulting from these events.\
  \ OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies that may exist between the\
  \ OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system. The\
  \ Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify\
  \ annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA. The Validated Agency Match System\
  \ processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits and prevent\
  \ subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for any overpayments\
  \ that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly\
  \ and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF).\
  \ OPM also utilizes Treasury's Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that should\
  \ have been reported as deceased.\n\nIn addition to internal controls OPM uses and\
  \ will continue to use training and audits to address improper payment issues.\n\
  \n\n"

  \ of compliance status. OPM had one program reporting estimates above the statutory\
  \ threshold, however, OPM’s Inspector General did not provide any recommendations\
  \ to further improve the prevention and reduction of improper payments and unknown\
  \ payments for OPM in their most recent PIIA Compliance report.\n\nOPM provided\
