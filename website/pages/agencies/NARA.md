detail_ara2_3: The last analysis NARA completed to determine whether recovery audits
  would be cost effective, they randomly selected several accounting firms located
  in the DC metro area from the GSA schedule (SIN 520-9). Using the price list, NARA
  compared the hourly charge for one supervisor, one staff accountant/analyst, and
  one technician/data entry specialist. NARA's improper payments were divided by the
  hourly cost for each vendor to determine how many hours could be billed at that
  rate before the cost of the audit would exceed the yearly improper payments identified.
  NARA's improper payments are recovered nearly 100% through its standard recovery
  methods and therefore, it has never proved cost effective for NARA to engage an
  audit firm to conduct payment recovery audits.

  Working System. Incorrect DNP

  information is rarely identified and therefore, corrections are rare. However when

detail_exs1: NARAâ€™s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with
  the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance
  audit. NARA conducts risk assessments for all programs with outlays over $10M on
  a three year risk assessment cycle. NARA last conducted an improper payment risk
  assessment in FY 2023 and determined that all programs were not susceptible to significant
  improper payment and were considered low risk. NARA's program outlays do not have
  improper payments above the statutory threshold and is classified as Phase 1. NARA's
  FY 2024 improper payments totaled $216,564.
