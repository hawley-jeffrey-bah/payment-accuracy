detail_agy1: The Department is unique to the federal government in that payments are
  processed across 47 payment sites, many operated by the integrated contractors at
  the 17 National laboratories, and 8 cleanup sites. This arrangement was first set
  up by Congress for the Manhattan Project during World War 2. The goal was to increase
  production speed and agility by reducing the bureaucracy inherent in the rules and
  regulations of the Federal Government. DOE has oversight responsibilities for these
  programs. Robust controls are mandated to detect and correct overpayments. These
  controls include contracting officers providing final approval for contract compliance,
  annual review and analysis of financial records and supporting documentation by
  financial management personal, and independent audits.

  \ $62.19B, of which $39.63M was determined to be improper resulting in improper\
  \ payment rate of 0.06%. The Department recaptured $29.88M of the $32.33M of the\
  \ improper payments identified for recapture, resulting in a recapture rate of 92.40%.\
  \ Due to the Department's low improper payment rate, and high recapture rate, the\
  \ determination was made that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery audits.\
  \ \n\nDOE conducts recovery activities including but not limited to prepayment review\
  \ and approval of invoices; performing quarterly prompt-payment reviews, post-payment\
  \ reviews, and contractor internal audits; leveraging the results of cost allowability\
  \ audits of integrated contractors and interim and close-out reviews of contracts\
  \ and grants, reviews of grant credits in the Automated Standard Application for\
  \ Payments (ASAP), and results from travel audits."

detail_dpa5: "DOE uses the Do Not Pay portal within the Treasury Working System to\
  \ review payments eligibility for DOE payment sites and some labs for purposes of\
  \ identifying and preventing improper payments and fraud.\n\nWhere the system identifies\
  \ exclusion matches for supplier records of POs with funding exhausted, DOE closes\
  \ such records. A note is then added in the DBA name field that the vendor has an\
  \ active exclusion. A request to reopen the supplier would alert the supplier team\
  \ to perform mandatory validation checks before reopening. This ensures no new awards\
  \ are granted to suppliers with active exclusions. DOE also send a daily file to\
  \ DNP for Batch Matching to ensure that there are no missed data source matches\
  \ in the Continuous Monitoring process that would result from any timing issues.\n\
  \nDOE utilizes DNP as a proactive solution for reducing/preventing improper payments\
  \ as opposed to being reactive. During FY 2023, there were 3 supplier records closed\
  \ due to active SAM Exclusion matches in DNP. Closing of supplier records prevents\
  \ procurement offices from entering into any new contracts with the vendors which\
  \ could result in improper payments. Since DNP is a proactive solution to preventing\
  \ improper payments, quantitative amount of the dollar or number of improper payments\
  \ prevented by the use of DNP cannot be made; otherwise, the cost of tracking would\
  \ outweigh the benefit.\n\nDOE utilizes other databases besides the SAM Exclusion,\
  \ such as:\n-\tAmerican InfoSource Death Data – Obituary (AIS-OBIT)\n-\tDept of\
  \ Defense Death Data (DOD)\n-\tSAM Entity Registration Records (SAMENT)\n-\tTOP\
  \ Debt Check (DBCK)\n-\tAmerican InfoSource Death Data – Probate (AIS-PROB)\n-\t\
  Dept of State Death Data (DOS)\n-\tNAPHSIS Electronic Verification of Vital Events\
  \ Fact of Death (EVVE FOD)\n-\tOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n-\tSAM Exclusion\
  \ Records – Restricted (SAM-EXCL-RES)\n-\tSSA Death Master File (DMF)\n\nFor FY\
  \ 2023, there were 112,655 payments screened through Do Not Pay totaling $10.6 billion.\n"
detail_exs1: "DOE’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent FY 2023\
  \ compliance audit for the reporting of FY 2022 payments. PIIA requires agencies\
  \ to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than\
  \ $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify\
  \ those susceptible to significant improper payments.\n\nCurrently, the Department\
  \ is reporting under the requirements of Phase 1 for Improper Payment IP reporting.\
  \ DOE is considered one program for improper payment reporting and assesses its\
  \ program by the payment type. DOE conducts risk assessments on a three-year cycle\
  \ for all payment types with outlays over $10M and FY 2024 was an on-cycle year.\
  \ Risk assessments were conducted for all six payment types resulting in a low-risk\
  \ rating for them under the DOE Payment Integrity Program. DOE also conducts site-specific\
  \ reviews and analysis of accounting and financial records, supporting documentation,\
  \ and other pertinent information supporting payments.  These activities are detective\
  \ and corrective in nature, and are designed to identify and recapture overpayments.\
  \  \n\nThe FY 2024 DOE Risk Assessments identified DOE as low risk. However, DOE\
  \ will continue to scrutinize improper payment activity and controls through its\
  \ internal control program by emphasizing, evaluating, and strengthening controls\
  \ as needed to maintain the Department’s record of low payment errors and to continue\
  \ the effective stewardship of public funds. The next on-cycle risk assessments\
  \ will take place in FY 2027."
