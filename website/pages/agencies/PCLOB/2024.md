detail_ara2_1: Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are
  subject to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for
  that month.  Invoices not processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP)
  in excess of $2,500.00 are subject to secondary review before being paid.  Invoices
  under $2,500.00 are subject to review through statistical sampling procedures.  Travel
  vouchers processed through the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel system are
  subject to a post payment audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements under
  $2,500.   All payments of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population.
  These payments require a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed
  through the MoveLINQ system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review.   For
  payment customers, once the vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment,
  they are interfaced to Oracle the financial system where they are paid.

detail_dpa5: PCLOB's financial service provider, ARC, runs the DNP process each week.
  According to our service provider, this has historically helped them reduce improper
  payments for their customers.
detail_exs1: 'PCLOB''s financial service provider (ARC) completes a number of activities
  throughout the year. ARC runs the DNP process on a weekly basis. On a monthly basis,
  ARC prepares Prompt Pay, Discounts Lost,

  and Improper Payment metrics, and any identified improper payments are uploaded
  to connect.gov website. Also, ARC randomly samples 10% of PCLOB''s previous month''s
  IPP activity to test for improper

  payments. This ensures that IPP system controls are operating as intended and provides
  info on COR performance. On a quarterly basis, ARC posts a quarterly report with
  PCLOB''s Prompt Pay, Discounts Lost, and Improper Payment data to MAX. On an annual
  basis, in March/April, ARC completes a PIIA risk assessment over the prior year''s
  data. In FY 2023, PCLOB had zero IPs.'

detail_pcp14: PCLOB does not have an OIG. ARC had no recommendations for improvements
  to further improve prevention and reduction of IPs and UPs within PCLOB since the
