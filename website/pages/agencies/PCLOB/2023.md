detail_agy1: PCLOB is an executive branch agency which has historically had outlays
  that did not exceed $10M; however, outlays did exceed $10M for the first time in
  2022 and again in 2023, moving the small agency into PHASE 1. Accordingly, PCLOB
  has never performed an IP Risk Assessment outside of its financial service providers
  activities, which are listed elsewhere in this survey. With outlays exceeding $10M
  for two consecutive years, the agency plans to perform its first IPP in FY 2024
  assuming outlays will continue to exceed $10M.

detail_dpa5: PCLOB's financial service provider, ARC, runs the DNP process each week.
  According to our service provider, this has historically helped them reduce improper
  payments for their customers.
detail_exs1: The PCLOB concluded that the agency was compliant with PIIA. On a weekly
  basis, our financial service provider (ARC) runs the DNP process. On a monthly basis,
  ARC prepares Prompt Pay, Discounts Lost, and Improper Payment metrics, and any identified
  improper payments are uploaded to our MAX website. Also, ARC randomly samples 10%
  of PCLOB's previous month's IPP activity to test for improper payments; this ensures
  that IPP system controls are operating as intended and provides info on COR performance.
  On a quarterly basis, ARC posts a quarterly report with PCLOB's Prompt Pay, Discounts
  Lost, and Improper Payment data to MAX. In FY 2023, PCLOB had zero IPs.
