Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Age eligibility theme occur because of an inability to access the data
      or information needed or failure to access the data or information needed.  When
      an individual applicant applies for benefits, we need to verify the claimant’s
      age.  Improper payments occur when there are payment errors associated with
      the age of the claimant or beneficiary and computations related to age.  Improper
      payments may occur when a technician fails to obtain proof of age to adjudicate
      a claim properly because a claimant or applicant fails to provide needed evidence
      of age and this is a barrier because the agency does not have access to another
      resource to verify the claimant or beneficiary’s age.
    Info: To determine whether an individual meets the Age eligibility criteria, when
      age is a factor of entitlement for benefits, individuals must provide proof
      that they meet age requirements.  In some cases, age impacts entitlement and
      the benefit amount.  The date of birth of the claimant or beneficiary may be
      incorrect within our systems at the time we compute benefits if the claimant
      or beneficiary fails to provide proof of age, or the agency does not have access
      to third party databases (e.g., Bureau of Vital Statistics).  If we use the
      incorrect age to compute benefits, we could pay the claimant or beneficiary
      the wrong payment amount.
    Theme: Age
  - Barriers: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Citizenship eligibility theme occur because of a failure to access the
      data or information needed.  When an individual applicant applies for benefits,
      we need to verify the claimant’s U.S. citizenship or lawful presence status
      in the United States when they are a non-citizen.  Improper payments occur when
      there are payment errors associated with the citizenship or lawful presence
      of the claimant or beneficiary.  Improper payments may occur when a technician
      fails to obtain proof of citizenship or lawful presence status to pay a claim
      properly because a claimant or applicant fails to provide needed evidence of
      U.S. citizenship or lawful presence status and the agency does not have access
      to another resource to verify the claimant or beneficiary’s U.S. citizenship
      or lawful presence status.  Possible barriers exist when the agency is unable
      to obtain proof of citizenship from the beneficiary or claimant or when technicians
      do not properly input the citizenship data.
    Info: To determine whether an individual meets the Citizenship eligibility criteria,
      when U.S. citizenship or lawfully present status is a factor of entitlement
      for benefits, individuals must provide proof that they were recognized as a
      U.S. citizen through birth or naturalization or were granted lawfully present
      status as a non-citizen in the United States.  In some cases, citizenship or
      lawful presence impacts entitlement.  The citizenship or lawful status of the
      claimant or beneficiary may be incorrect within our systems at the time that
      we compute benefits if the claimant or beneficiary fails to provide proof, or
      when the agency cannot access third party databases to verify status (e.g.,
      the Department of Homeland Security).  If we use the incorrect citizenship or
      lawful status, we could erroneously pay or not pay the claimant or beneficiary.
    Theme: Citizenship
  - Barriers: 'Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Deceased eligibility theme occur because of an inability to access the
      data or information needed or failure to access the data or information needed.  When
      an individual applicant applies for benefits, we need to verify that the number
      holder is deceased.  Improper payments occur when there are payment errors associated
      with the death of the number holder or computations related to widow(er) benefits.  Improper
      payments may occur when a technician is unable to obtain proof of death to adjudicate
      a claim properly because a claimant or applicant fails to provide needed evidence
      of death and the agency does not have access to another resource to verify the
      number holder’s death.  Improper payments may also occur when a technician fails
      to use the proper computation method to pay widow(er) benefits.


      This theme represents payment errors associated with the death of the beneficiary
      and widow or widower benefit computations.  While technician errors may account
      for some delayed processing of benefit terminations, we often receive reports
      of death after a payment cycle cutoff date.  Additionally, our policies require
      that we verify third-party reports of death prior to posting the death to our
      records to minimize erroneous death terminations.  The existing barrier usually
      occurs when there is a delay in third-party reporting of death, resulting in
      delayed processing of benefits termination.  Additional barriers are the result
      of technician error, when widow or widower’s benefits (WIB) are incorrectly
      calculated (for example, the failure to consider widow(er)s index, incorrectly
      calculating WIB, not applying the deceased number holder’s Delayed Retirement
      Credits to the widow benefit, or not applying Retirement Insurance Benefits
      Limitation when calculating the widow or widower benefits.)'
    Info: To determine whether an individual meets the Deceased eligibility criteria,
      when the death of a number holder is a factor of entitlement for benefits, individuals
      must provide proof that the number holder is deceased.  Death impacts entitlement
      and, in some widow(er) cases, the benefit amount.  The date of death of the
      number holder may be unproven within our systems at the time we compute benefits
      if the claimant or beneficiary fails to provide proof of death, or the agency
      does not have access to third party databases (e.g., Bureau of Vital Statistics).  We
      may also incorrectly calculate benefits for a widow(er) after updating death
      information on the Numident.  If we use the incorrect date of death or use an
      incorrect method to compute benefits, we could pay the claimant or beneficiary
      the wrong payment amount.
    Theme: Deceased
  - Barriers: 'Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Employment eligibility theme occur because of our inability to access
      the data or information needed or failure to access the data or information
      needed.  Income from employment, including self-employment, is used to determine
      the primary insurance amount and whether a beneficiary is entitled to payment.  Payment
      errors are associated with wages, computations related to earnings, the Annual
      Earnings Test (AET), and work after disability, such as substantial gainful
      activity (SGA).  Barriers exist when we do not have access to third-party databases
      (Employer Records) and a beneficiary fails to report work activity or changes
      in income and/or provides incorrect or untimely information.  There are barriers
      to timely determining Employment requirements.  Barriers also exist when technicians:  have
      access to wage information and employer records but fail to update beneficiary
      records; fail to apply the AET correctly; fail to calculate the correct primary
      insurance amount or apply correct Adjustment Reduction Factors; and do not take
      appropriate or timely action to adjust payments for Disability Insurance beneficiaries
      based on SGA.  We maintain wage reporting via W-2 and W-3 or equivalent electronic
      reports to update earnings for number holders; however, we may receive duplicate
      or erroneously posted earnings information or inaccurate wage postings.'
    Info: To determine whether a beneficiary meets the Employment eligibility criteria,
      we verify the employment status of a beneficiary.  Beneficiaries can meet Employment
      eligibility criteria depending on the program requirement and work status, which
      may include if they can work, are available to work, are actively seeking work,
      are employed, are separated from employment, or are registered for employment
      services.  Employment can affect retirement benefits when determining insured
      status, calculating the benefit amount, adjusting benefits when the Cost of
      Living Allowances are applicable, or when benefits are adjusted because of work.  Employment
      also affects disability benefits when earnings affect the Date of Onset, or
      result in Substantial Gainful Activity, reinstatement of benefits, or give rise
      to other disability issues that affect the payment.
    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Household Size eligibility theme occur because of failure to access the
      data or information needed.  Incorrect payments may occur when there are computation
      errors related to the family maximum (FMAX).  The FMAX is the maximum monthly
      amount that can be paid on a number holder’s earnings record without regard
      to household composition.  The total amount paid to each beneficiary using the
      maximum is determined by the number of entitled beneficiaries on the number
      holder’s record and those benefits can be affected when the beneficiary is dually
      entitled (divorced spouses and surviving divorced spouses are excluded from
      the family maximum computation).  There are barriers to determining household
      requirements.  Barriers include calculation errors by technicians when the FMAX
      is involved.  These errors resulted when benefits were paid using the table
      max instead of the combined family max or when dual entitlement reduced a beneficiary’s
      rate to a partial payable rate and the remainder was not redistributed to other
      auxiliaries on the record, following the deduction before reduction provision.  When
      we identify an underpayment posted to a record, we can request corrective action.
    Info: To determine whether a beneficiary meets the Household Size eligibility
      criteria requirement, we must evaluate the number of family members on the number
      holder’s record without regards to household composition.  The total benefits
      paid must include beneficiaries paid from the family maximum.
    Theme: Household Size
  - Barriers: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Marital Status eligibility theme occur because of inability to access
      the data or information needed or failure to access data or information needed.  The
      barrier prohibiting us from preventing improper payments because of marriage
      is the beneficiary’s failure to timely report changes in their marital status.
    Info: To determine whether a beneficiary meets the Marital Status eligibility
      criteria, we must evaluate a beneficiary’s state of being unmarried, married,
      divorced, or widowed.  Entitlement to some categories of benefits is impacted
      by the beneficiary’s marital status, so we rely on beneficiaries to report changes
      in their marital status.
    Theme: Marital Status
  - Barriers: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Military Status eligibility theme occur because of failure to access
      the data or information needed from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and
      Department of Defense.  The Military Status eligibility theme is the condition
      of being or having been in the uniformed services.  Payment errors may be associated
      with military wages and credits.  Technicians may not obtain evidence supporting
      military earnings or credits, fail to apply correct Deemed Military Wage (DMW)
      credits based on available evidence, or apply DMW credits incorrectly based
      on available evidence.  A beneficiary’s failure to provide evidence could also
      be a barrier in identifying underpayments.
    Info: 'This theme’s eligibility criteria is based on the condition of being or
      having been in the uniformed services.  To meet the Military Status eligibility
      criteria, a beneficiary must have military discharge status, military service
      status, selective service status, or a service connection.


      A member of a uniformed service includes any person appointed, enlisted, or
      inducted into, or a retired member of, a component of the Army, Navy, Air Force,
      Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Space Force or:  any of the Reserve components of
      any uniformed service without specification of component (except the Coast Guard
      Reserve as a temporary member), a commissioned officer (including a retired
      commissioned officer) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
      or the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service, a member of the
      Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, a cadet at the U.S. Military, Coast
      Guard or Air Force Academy or a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, a member
      of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, the Naval Reserve Officers Training
      Corps or the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps when ordered to annual
      duty for 14 days or more including periods of authorized travel to and from
      that duty, a person selected for active military or naval training under the
      Military Selective Service Act or provisionally accepted for active duty in
      the military or naval service and are ordered or directed to a place for final
      acceptance or entry upon active duty and are on the way to or from or at that
      place.'
    Theme: Military Status
  - Barriers: 'Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance improper payments included
      in the Receiving Benefits from Other Sources eligibility theme occur because
      of inability to access the data or information needed and failure to access
      the data or information needed.  We are required to validate an applicant or
      beneficiary’s receipt of payment from other benefit programs prior to issuing
      payment.


      This theme represents payment errors normally associated with cases involving
      Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), Government Pension Offset (GPO), Workers’
      Compensation (WC), Public Disability Benefits (PDB), or multiple entitlement
      to benefits.  There are barriers prohibiting us from improving prevention of
      improper payments by timely determining whether an applicant or beneficiary
      is receiving benefits from other sources.  Technicians may not obtain, or have
      access to, evidence to apply WEP, WC/PDB, or GPO on a record.  Technicians may
      incorrectly calculate WC/PDB offset.  Beneficiaries may not report changes to
      WC/PDB payments or changes to the pension amount for GPO.  We do not have access
      to all of the WC/PDB data from all States.  We primarily rely on the beneficiary
      to report their receipt or potential receipt of a non-covered pension at the
      time of the initial application or after entitlement if entitlement to the non-covered
      pension is in the future.  Technicians may improperly calculate multiple entitlement
      benefits.


      Additional barriers to correctly implementing WEP, WC/PDB, and GPO to prevent
      improper payments include:  lack of accurate data to administer WEP, WC/PDB,
      and GPO provisions, lack of automation to minimize human error and ensure timely
      action in response to existing alerts, lack of understanding on how to compute
      WEP, WC/PDB, and GPO and apply the exceptions to them, and lack of understanding
      among agency technicians on how non-covered pensions work (e.g., whether the
      payments are recurring or issued in a lump sum or whether there may be a cost-of-living
      adjustment), which is key to correctly administering WEP, WC/PDB, and GPO.


      We use several sources to verify receiving benefits from other sources.  We
      maintain a matching agreement with the Office of Personnel Management to obtain
      information on Federal Government retirees who receive a pension from work not
      covered by Social Security.  We also have a Memorandum of Understanding with
      the Department of Labor (DOL) to allow a limited number of our Processing Centers
      and Regional Office employees access to DOL’s Employees Compensation Operations
      and Management Portal to obtain Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) benefit
      payment information.  This access allows verification of FECA payments for workers’
      compensation offset purposes.  We obtain foreign pension information through
      beneficiary or claimant self-reporting.'
    Info: To determine whether a beneficiary meets the Receiving Benefits from Other
      Sources eligibility criteria, we are required to validate an applicant or beneficiary’s
      receipt of payment from other benefit programs prior to issuing payment.  A
      beneficiary may be entitled to benefits from other sources such as a non-covered
      pension (including foreign pensions), workers’ compensation or public disability
      benefits, or be dually entitled.
    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources
- Program_Name: Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
  Themes:
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) improper payments included in the
      Address/Location eligibility theme occur because data or information needed
      does not exist, inability to access the data or information needed, and failure
      to access the data or information needed.  When an applicant or recipient is
      not a transient, or a resident of an institution, we are required to validate
      their living arrangement prior to issuing payment.  If recipients are not paying
      their pro rata share of household expenses, we generally count the difference
      between the pro rata share amount and the actual contribution as income to the
      recipient in the form of in-kind support and maintenance (ISM).  This type of
      income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month
      as household expenses and composition and the type of assistance provided may
      change.  Therefore, we ask questions to help determine if recipients are paying
      their share of household expenses and must rely on recipients to report changes
      in household expenses, composition, and contributions accurately and timely.  Our
      reliance on self-reporting is a barrier to validating an applicant’s or recipient’s
      living arrangement and ISM prior to issuing a payment.  However, as of September
      30, 2024, we are no longer counting food as income when we figure SSI payments
      and we have expanded the rental subsidy policy.  Additionally, we have expanded
      the definition of a public assistance household to include households receiving
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments and households where at least
      one household member other than the recipient or applicant receives public assistance.  These
      three updates are part of SSI regulation simplification.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Address/Location
      eligibility criteria, when an applicant or recipient is not a transient, or
      a resident of an institution, we are required to validate their living arrangement
      prior to issuing payment.  We develop an individual’s living arrangement for
      their permanent residence to ensure we use the correct in-kind support and maintenance
      (ISM) valuation rule and we do not overlook sources of ISM.
    Theme: Address/Location
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income improper payments included in the Deceased
      eligibility theme occur because of failure to access data or information needed
      or inability to access the data or information needed.  We are required to validate
      that there is no date of death on the record of the applicant or current recipient
      prior to issuing a payment for a month.  We validate and document the date of
      death using a system query or proof found in our electronic repository.  We
      receive and process reports of death from a variety of sources.  Nearly 93 percent
      of these reports come to us from States, but we also receive death information
      from family members, funeral homes, other Federal agencies (e.g., the Office
      of Personnel Management, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Centers
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services), and financial institutions.  Barriers that
      prohibit us from improving the prevention of improper payments are the failure
      of family members to report recipient deaths and delays in reporting recipient
      deaths.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Deceased eligibility
      criteria, we are required to validate that there is no date of death on the
      record of the applicant or current recipient prior to issuing a payment for
      a month.  We validate and document the date of death using a system query or
      proof found in our electronic repository.

      \  We are required to validate that an SSI applicant or current SSI recipient\

      \ to determine eligibility and calculate accurate payment amounts for those\
      \ individuals who authorize us to obtain wage and employment information from\
      \ a commercial payroll data provider (e.g., Equifax).\n\nData matching can present\
      \ its own barriers, among them privacy and data security concerns.  Matching\
      \ data would need to be accurate, acquired timely, and offer sufficient detail\
      \ to prevent employment-related improper payments.  Our verification process\
      \ is a manual, one-to-one match and wages are reported annually or quarterly,\
      \ which can be inaccurate when converted or averaged to monthly amounts.  Unless\

    Theme: Employment
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) improper payments included in the
      Financial eligibility theme occur because of inability to access the data or
      information needed and failure to access the data or information needed.  We
      are required to validate an applicant or recipient’s countable resources prior
      to issuing payment.  An individual applicant/recipient (or couple) must confirm
      that they do not have countable resources in excess of the statutory limit ($2,000
      for an individual and $3,000 for a couple) to be eligible for SSI.  Social Security
      regulations define resources as assets the individual (or their spouse) owns,
      can convert to cash, and can use for their support and maintenance.  This includes
      things such as cash, funds held in financial accounts, real property, and personal
      property.  SSI applicants and recipients are required to report their resources
      to the agency to ensure they are eligible for SSI; in determining SSI eligibility,
      we also take into account resources for deemors (ineligible spouses or parents
      of minor children).  Eligibility for payments is determined as of the first
      moment of each calendar month; that determination is applicable to the entire
      month.  We must verify financial account funds during the initial claims intake
      processing and post-entitlement activities.  We use Access to Financial Institutions
      (AFI) to verify financial accounts.  AFI effectively detects unreported accounts
      and identifies excess amounts in known accounts.  For institutions that do not
      participate in AFI, we request bank information from the individual and may
      request information directly from non-participating financial institutions.  However,
      because the AFI tool works retroactively by providing current and past monthly
      balances, it does not prevent improper payments.  We use the LexisNexis/Accurint
      tool to identify other resources, such as non-home real property (NHRP).  However,
      we can use the NHRP information only to establish a lead for further investigation
      and potential action; developing and verifying the NHRP is a manual process.  Program
      complexity is a barrier to improvement as SSI makes eligibility and payment
      determinations on a monthly basis.  Matching data would need to be accurate,
      acquired timely, and offer sufficient detail to prevent financial accounts-related
      improper payments.  We rely on individuals to self-report changes in their resources
      (e.g., financial institution account balances and NHRP ownership) timely and
      accurately, and our reliance on self-reporting is a barrier to validating an
      applicant’s or recipient’s countable resources prior to issuing a payment.

      Status eligibility theme occur because of inability to access the data or information
      needed and failure to access the data or information needed.  The barriers prohibiting
      us from preventing improper payments because of marriage are the recipient’s
      failure to timely report their marital status.  We rely on individuals to self-report
      marital status changes timely to determine the correct Federal Benefit Rate.  Two
      eligible individuals who are married and residing together are entitled to the
      couple’s benefit rate.  If they separate or divorce, the benefit amount will
      change.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Marital Status
      eligibility criteria, we are required to validate the applicant or recipient’s
      marital status prior to issuing payment.  Two eligible individuals who are married
      and residing together are entitled to the couple’s benefit rate.  We rely on
      spouses to report separations or divorces, which affect the benefit amount.
    Theme: Marital Status
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) improper payments included in the
      Prisoner Status eligibility theme occur because of inability to access the data
      or information needed.  We are required to validate an applicant or recipient’s
      prisoner status prior to issuing payment.  An individual who is a resident of
      a public penal institution throughout a month is ineligible for SSI, since the
      recipient receives substantially all of their food and shelter while living
      there.  We rely on individuals to self-report correctional institution status
      timely, and our reliance on self-reporting is a barrier to validating an applicant’s
      or recipient’s prisoner status prior to issuing a payment.  An individual who
      receives all food and shelter while living in an institution is not eligible
      for SSI.  We must contact facilities to verify the status and details (i.e.,
      dates of incarceration/release for individuals incarcerated) to determine the
      period of ineligibility.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Prisoner Status
      eligibility criteria, we are required to validate the applicant or recipient’s
      prisoner status prior to issuing payment.  An individual who is a resident of
      a public penal institution throughout a month is ineligible for Supplemental
      Security Income.
    Theme: Prisoner Status
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) improper payments included in the
      Receiving Benefits from Other Sources eligibility theme occur because of inability
      to access the data or information needed and failure to access the data or information
      needed.  SSI is intended to be a program of last resort.  We are required to
      validate an applicant or recipient’s receipt of payment from other benefit programs
      prior to issuing payment.  We also assess the other benefit programs for which
      an individual is eligible (e.g., annuities, pensions, and Old-Age, Survivors,
      and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits), and may count them as sources of
      income that reduce SSI.  Filing for other benefits is a requirement for SSI
      eligibility.  Other benefits for which a recipient must file include annuities,
      pensions, OASDI benefits, veterans’ pensions, retirement benefits, and workers’
      compensation payments.  We mainly rely on individuals to self-report information
      relevant to their eligibility for other benefits, when they stop receiving benefits,
      or when there are changes in benefit amounts.  There is not an all-inclusive
      data source to determine eligibility or receipt of other benefits, so we rely
      in significant part on self-reporting in this area.  Our reliance on self-reporting
      is a barrier to validating an applicant's or recipient's eligibility for or
      receipt of payment from other benefit programs prior to issuing a payment.  We
      are authorized to access a Veterans Benefits Administration database that houses
      military discharge records.  The information on the Veterans Benefits Administration
      Query is the DD-214 for veterans who have applied for Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) services.  We must obtain any military discharge data that is not
      provided by this query from the veteran, the VA, or other appropriate sources.  We
      attribute errors to the agency when we fail to take appropriate or timely action
      to a known event.
    Info: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is intended to be a program of last resort.  To
      determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Receiving Benefits from
      Other Sources eligibility criteria, we are required to validate the applicant
      or recipient’s receipt of payment from other benefit programs prior to issuing
      payment.  We also assess other benefit programs for which an individual is eligible
      (e.g., annuities, pensions, and Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
      benefits), and may count them as sources of income that reduce SSI.  Individuals
      eligible for other sources must file for them in order to qualify for SSI payments.
    Theme: Receiving Benefits from Other Sources
  - Barriers: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) improper payments included in the
      Residency eligibility theme occur because of inability to access the data or
      information needed.  We are required to validate an applicant or recipient’s
      residency status prior to issuing payment.  The Social Security Act requires
      us to suspend payments to SSI recipients who remain outside of the United States
      for an entire calendar month.  If an SSI recipient is absent from the United
      States for 30 or more consecutive days, payments remain suspended until the
      individual returns to the United States.  and remains present for 30 consecutive
      days.  Sole reliance on the self-reporting of travel outside the United States
      by recipients jeopardizes our ability to make accurate payments in the SSI program.  We
      mainly rely on self-reporting to determine when a material absence from the
      United States affects payment eligibility, and our reliance on self-reporting
      is a barrier to validating an applicant’s or recipient’s residency status prior
      to issuing a payment.  Most people do not report their material travel outside
      of the United States timely or at all, which causes improper payments.  We must
      verify third-party reports (e.g., Arrival and Departure Information System data
      from the Department of Homeland Security) with the recipient before taking any
      actions to adjust SSI payments.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Residency eligibility
      criteria, we are required to validate the applicant or recipient’s United States
      residency status prior to issuing payment.  Under the Social Security Act, a
      person is ineligible for Supplemental Security Income during any full month
      in which they are outside of the United States, which is defined for these purposes
      as the 50 States, District of Columbia, and Northern Mariana Islands.  If a
      person is absent from the United States for 30 or more consecutive days, they
      remain ineligible until they return to the United States and remain present
      for 30 consecutive days.

detail_CAP5: 'The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity
  Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY)
  2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold,
  our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security
  Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security OIG
  concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements, but we
  did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements to
  payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate
  for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated, “While
  SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper payments,
  it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included the following
  recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment
  strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”


  We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our
  corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI
  and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we identify the root causes and evaluate
  the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine
  the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment
  errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  IPAS is the process
  that we use to obtain agency wide engagement and agreement on actions needed to
  remedy improper payment issues.  In FY 2025, we will complete the IPAS for OASDI
  computations and draft a new IPAS on relationship.


  OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access
  data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party
  provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute
  the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate
  the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from
  occurring, technicians follow existing procedures, and we provide training and reminders
  for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when
  possible.  We will continue to improve technician tools and processes and strengthen
  our training to better equip our workforce.


  OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access
  data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party
  either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information
  necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments
  is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment.  To reduce our
  reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information, we plan to
  utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information
  from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information exchange (PIE),
  which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment
  accuracy rate.


  For the SSI program, of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately
  $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data
  or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist
  or is inaccessible to us.  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both
  overpayments and underpayments.  We will continue to improve notices to make it
  easier to understand.  As of September 30, 2024, as part of the SSI regulation simplification
  in-kind and maintenance updates, we removed a significant burden to report receipt
  of food assistance and reduced reporting burdens for individuals living in public
  assistance households.  Additionally, the expansion of the rental subsidy may increase
  the benefit amount some people are eligible to receive and will allow more people
  to qualify for critical SSI payments.


  Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages,
  we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information
  from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published
  a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and
  using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments
  and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period
  closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft
  the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In
  FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited
  issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from
  PIE doesn''t automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We
  plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule
  is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach,
  and updating policy in preparation for implementation.

  '
detail_agy1: For both the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Supplemental
  Security Income programs, much of the overpayments occur outside of the agency’s
  control.  However, we continue to find ways to influence change where possible and
  focus on mitigation strategies within our control.

detail_ara2_3: 'We meet the recovery activities program requirements of Payment Integrity
  Information Act of 2019 for our benefit programs.  We have no plans to conduct payment
  recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing firm
  because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental
  Security Income (SSI) programs’ complexity.  We conducted extensive market research
  prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information
  and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents,
  who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and
  audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The typical claims
  specialist (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position)
  receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does not
  achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for 2 years.


  We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.9 billion in fiscal
  year (FY) 2024 at an administrative cost of $0.08 on average per dollar collected.  To
  recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques (i.e., payment
  withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external collection techniques
  authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 for OASDI debts and the
  Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.


  We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau reporting,
  and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent debts.  Because
  the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future collection interfaces
  with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External Collection Operation
  system.


  The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments
  paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and is
  not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before the
  date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial institutions,
  we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we have actual or
  constructive knowledge of a beneficiary’s death or legal incapacity.  A financial
  institution may protest a recovery of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation
  timely.


  For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven
  cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying improper payments.  In
  2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm on a contingency
  fee basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based its review on past
  industry experience of improper payment rates, and a cost/benefit analysis of transactions
  processed by type and dollars paid.  Because of their minimal recovery, the auditors
  terminated the contract.

  handled by the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center (MATPSC).  The MATPSC remittance
  process requires a method of payment (check, money order, debit or credit card)
  and a corresponding payment coupon necessary to update a debtor’s record.  In fiscal
  year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements
  to our remittance process.  In FY 2021, we started accepting repayment of benefit
  overpayments through the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov via credit
  or debit card and automated clearing house (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.  In
  addition to this effort, we partnered with Treasury to use U.S. Bank, a financial
  agent for Treasury, to implement a lockbox service to assist with our paper remittance
  processing efforts at the MATPSC.  Lastly, we implemented Online Bill Pay (OLBP),
  allowing debtors to make a one-time or recurring ACH draft from a bank account using
  a personal computer or mobile phone.  In FY 2023, we extended the lockbox service
  to include Supplemental Security Income remittances.  These enhancements now account
  for approximately 51 percent of our remittance activity.


  In FY 2024, we processed over 469,000 remittances and collected over $94 million
  through Pay.gov; we processed approximately 195,000 remittances and collected over
  $56 million through the lockbox service; and we processed over 49,000 remittances
  and collected over $5 million through the OLBP.

  recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment
  strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”


  The reporting period for this data call reflects FY 2024, and whether the agency
  is compliant will be determined in calendar year 2025.  PIIA requires agencies to
  review and assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for
  improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible
  to significant improper payments.  Programs that are not likely to have an annual
  amount of improper payments plus annual unknown payments above the statutory threshold
  (which is either (a) both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10,000,000 of all
  program payments made during the fiscal year, or (b) $100,000,000) are in Phase
  1.  Per this definition, our Administrative Payments program is in Phase 1.  Our
  assessment of improper payment risk in our Administrative Payments program in FY
  2024 determined that the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments.  We
  will conduct another improper payment risk assessment of our Administrative Payments
  program in FY 2027.  If a program in Phase 1 is likely to annually make improper
  payments and unknown payments above the statutory threshold, then the program will
  move into Phase 2 the following year.  Once in Phase 2 a program will have a different
  set of requirements such as reporting an annual improper payment and unknown payment
  estimate.  Our OASDI and SSI programs are in Phase 2.


  Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be
  available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.4 trillion
  to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $3.3 billion were overpayments,
  representing approximately 0.24 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments
  during this same period were $833.4 million, the equivalent of approximately 0.06
  percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship
  reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $1.3 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of
  that total, we estimate about $6.5 billion were overpayments, representing approximately
  0.51 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period
  were $1.8 billion, the equivalent of approximately 0.14 percent of outlays.  When
  comparing prior year reporting to this year''s reporting, there has been a decrease
  in estimated overpayments ($6.5 billion to $3.3 billion) and underpayments ($1.8
  billion to $833.4 million) in the OASDI program.


  OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access
  data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party
  provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute
  the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate

  OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access
  data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party
  either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information
  necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments
  is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information.  From
  October 2023 through February 2024, we released social media posts on Facebook and
  Twitter sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn about the
  importance of reporting wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.   To
  reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information,
  we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment
  information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information
  exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to
  have a high payment accuracy rate.


  Our greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI is a
  means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind,
  disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory
  requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We
  generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that
  month.  Many factors impact SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct
  when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting
  in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements sometimes
  make improper payments inevitable.  Improper payments often occur if recipients
  (or their representative payees) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility
  factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure
  to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.


  Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be
  available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $61.0 billion
  to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $5.6 billion were overpayments,
  representing approximately 9.18 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments
  during this same period were $877.9 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.44
  percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship
  reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $57.6 billion to SSI recipients.  Of
  that total, we estimate about $4.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately
  8.02 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period
  were $680.8 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.18 percent of outlays.  When
  comparing prior year reporting to this year’s reporting, there has been an increase
  in estimated overpayments ($4.6 billion to $5.6 billion) and underpayments ($680.8
  million to $877.9 million) in the SSI program.


  Of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $5.3 billion was
  due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to
  validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible
  to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting
  of financial accounts over the countable resource limit and employment and wage
  information.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates reminding
  them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring we have
  current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that explains to
  SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The blog provides
  examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving a Better Life
  Experience accounts.  In general, to address the root causes due to factors outside
  of agency’s control, we conduct quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity
  work including SSI non-medical redeterminations.  Additionally, to reduce the reliance
  on self-reporting, we continue to expand and pursue new data exchange partners from
  government and private sectors.


  Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages,
  we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information
  from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published
  a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and
  using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments
  and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period
  closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft
  the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In
  FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited
  issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from
  PIE doesn''t automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We
  plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule
  is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach,
  and updating policy in preparation for implementation.


  Approximately $346.7 million in SSI overpayments were within the agency’s control
  and due to our failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy
  prior to making a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly
  computing the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting
  the payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology
  modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools.  To
  meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible,
  we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians,
  and automating more of our business processes.


  We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our
  corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI
  and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed
  mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies
  to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise
  the strategies as needed.  In FY 2024, we completed the evaluation of completed
  actions on financial accounts and in-kind support and maintenance.  In FY 2025,
  we will draft a new IPAS on relationship and OASDI computations.

detail_raa9: 'Our fiscal year (FY) 2024 improper payment risk assessment of FY 2023
  administrative payments included a review of Payroll and Benefits, State Disability
  Determination Services (DDS), and Other Administrative Expenses.  We will not have
  all FY 2024 data until January 2025.


  Payroll and benefits account for a majority of our total administrative expenses.  For
  FY 2023, we found approximately $3.35 million in improper payroll overpayments out
  of $7,925 million payroll payments, which yielded a 0.04 percent improper overpayment
  rate.


  For State DDS payments, our 10 regional offices review amounts drawn against pre-approved
  DDS spending plans.  For payment accuracy, our Office of the Inspector General reviews
  the DDS payments on a rotational basis.  We use our Inspector General’s findings,
  if any, to enhance our payment controls.


  From the Other Administrative Expenses category, we review vendor and employee travel
  payments using an existing internal recovery activities program with tools to aid
  in the detection and recovery of improper overpayments, including:  an automated
  query system to identify duplicate payments made to the same vendor, with the same
  invoice date, and for the same amount; an annual payment accuracy review examining
  select criteria on a random sample of payments to identify IPs or a weakness in
  the internal payment recapture audit program; and a risk assessment of administrative
  payment systems and recovery of any overpayments identified in this process.


  We identified total FY 2023 vendor and travel improper overpayments of $0.92 million,
  approximately 0.05 percent of total payments subject to review.


  As part of our review of Other Administrative Expenses, we reviewed our Inspector
  General (IG) report, Fiscal Year 2023 Periodic Assessment of the Social Security
  Administration’s Charge Card Programs, which was published in April 2024.  OIG stated
  the following regarding the results of the assessment:  “We determined the risk
  of illegal, improper, and erroneous purchases made through SSA’s charge card programs
  is low.  SSA implemented safeguards and internal controls to prevent waste, fraud,
  and abuse of purchase cards, travel cards, and CBAs by designing its policies and
  procedures to address the requirements in the Act and OMB Circular A-123, Appendix
  B.”


  In addition, in May 2020, we performed administrative fraud risk assessments to
  actively measure the effectiveness of the internal controls over the processing
  of grants, large contracts, and travel and purchase cards.  These FY 2020 assessments
  found that our management-related risks for these administrative payments fall well
  below the OMB threshold.  In FY 2024, we conducted a maintenance assessment in the
  administrative fraud program areas consistent with Government Accountability Office
  guidance.


  We also leveraged the results of an independent accounting firm’s FY 2018 residual
  risk assessment in support of our FMFIA Internal Control Program.  This assessment
  found that our administrative expenses, accounts payables, human resources, and
  payroll management-related residual risks are low overall.  Testing over the years,
  including our FY 2024 internal testing of controls in those areas confirmed that
  the residual risk remains low.


  Results from our comprehensive recovery activities program and quality review process
  confirm that our administrative payments are well below the Office of Management
  and Budget threshold for reporting IPs.
