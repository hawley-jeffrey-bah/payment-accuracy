detail_ara2_3: The IPERA also requires agencies to conduct payment-recapture audits
  for each program that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits
  would be cost-effective. Based on the criteria set forth in Appendix C of OMB Circular
  A-123, the agency has also determined that it would not be cost-effective to establish
  a recovery-audit program for its programs that expend more than $1 million. Recoveries
  are not expected to be greater than the costs incurred to identify any overpayments.

detail_dpa5: The Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative serves as a useful tool in mitigating
  the possibility of Improper Awards and Payments. If a vendor is on the DNP list,
  this information is communicated to our Contracting Officer thereby ensuring no
  contract awards occur with vendors on the DNP list thereby mitigating the possibility
  of potentially problematic contract awards/payments occurring.
detail_exs1: The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) remains committed to fiscal
  responsibility and diligent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. As part of our ongoing
  efforts, FLRA operates on a three-year Improper Payment risk assessment cycle. The
  results of our most recent risk assessment conducted in FY22 reaffirmed that FLRA's
  programs are not likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments, demonstrating
  our effective management and financial integrity. FLRA is currently in compliance
  with PIIA and has no Programs with annual outlays over $10M and therefore does not
  have any programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments.
