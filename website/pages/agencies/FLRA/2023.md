detail_ara2_3: The IPERA also requires agencies to conduct payment-recapture audits
  for each program that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits
  would be cost-effective. Based on the criteria set forth in Appendix C of OMB Circular
  A-123, the agency has also determined that it would not be cost-effective to establish
  a recovery-audit program for its programs that expend more than $1 million. Recoveries
  are not expected to be greater than the costs incurred to identify any overpayments.

detail_dpa5: The Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative serves as a useful tool in mitigating
  the possibility of Improper Awards and Payments.  If a vendor is on the DNP list,
  this information is communicated to our Contracting Officer thereby ensuring no
  contract awards occur with vendors on the DNP list thereby mitigating the possibility
  of potentially problematic contract awards/payments occurring.
detail_exs1: The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) remains committed to fiscal
  responsibility and diligent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. As part of our ongoing
  efforts, FLRA operates on a three-year Improper Payment risk assessment cycle. The
  results of our most recent risk assessment conducted in FY22 reaffirmed that FLRA's
  programs are not likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments, demonstrating
  our effective management and financial integrity.
detail_pcp12_1: null
detail_pcp14: The OIG determined that the FLRA was not compliant with regard to the
  agency-level PIIA reporting requirements for FY 2022. The link to paymentaccuracy.gov
  did not have any reporting information from FLRA as required by OMB’s Annual Data
  Call. To be compliant, the OIG recommended FLRA respond to OMB’s Annual Data Call
  with the required fields information and post the required link to accompanying
  materials on paymentaccuracy.gov within future PARs. It's noted that if "Non-compliant"
  was chosen above, FLRA would have to identify which program was not in compliance
  and FLRA does not have any programs in phase 2 that are applicable; and therefore
  this survey would not be able to be completed.
