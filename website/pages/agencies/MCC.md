detail_agy1: MCC continues to have low identified improper payments totaling $0.47
  million in FY 2024.  MCC identified an improper payment of $0.36 million, comprising
  approximately 76% of the total identified improper payment amount, which was recovered
  in FY 2024.  Overall, MCC recovered $0.61 million in FY 2024 which included prior
  year improper payments.  MCC will continue to rely on the strength of MCC's internal
  controls and oversight, and diligently work to recover the remaining funds.

detail_ara2_3: MCC concluded recovery audits would not be cost effective and benefit
  MCC's internal control structure for all funds. Based on the latest risk assessments
  conducted in FY 2023, MCC does not have any funds susceptible to significant improper
  payments. MCC conducts independent audits on compact and threshold programs on an
  annual basis. These audits are reviewed for questioned costs and other improper
  payments, and tracked as necessary. The other MCC funds historically have very low
  annual overpayments.

detail_dpa5: On a weekly basis, IBC uploads MCC Payment batches into the Do Not Pay
  Portal. Treasury returns the payment batches to IBC who uploads the files in Oracle
  and advises MCC that the files are available. MCC downloads the Payment Activity
  Report monthly from the Do Not Pay Portal and reviews the list for items in need
  of adjudication. Flagged payments or payments listed as possible matches are reviewed
  with the respective MCC division making the payment before a determination is reported
  to Treasury on the portal. Although payments can be flagged, the system often either
  produces false positive or inaccurate probable matches. Therefore, MCC vendors are
  vetted in other databases like SAM which is more accurate prior to award and payments.
  MCC did not identify any improper payments as a result of the Do Not Pay Initiative.
detail_exs1: 'The USAID Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the agency
  was compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most
  recent compliance audit. PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs
  and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment
  risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant
  improper payments. MCC last completed a risk assessment on its programs in FY 2023
  on the Compact Assistance, Compact Development Funding, Threshold, Due Diligence,
  and Administrative Fund and identified no programs which are likely susceptible
  to significant improper payments.  Additional programs were below the $10 million
  threshold and were not assessed during FY 2023.  These programs are still under
  the threshold in FY 2024.  MCC evaluated all programs in FY 2024 to ensure no significant
  legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding to determine if the agency
  needed to reassess its risk posture and whether programs

  moved above the threshold levels set by PIIA. No programs were identified meeting
  this criteria.  MCC will perform this review again in FY 2025.  MCC will continue
  to maintain a payment integrity environment with strong internal controls and low
  improper payments.'
