detail_ara2_3: As part of the invoice  payment process, the FEC looks for potential
  recoverable amounts.  With a low percentage of improper payments, and a low dollar
  amount of invoices, it is not cost effective to procure recovery audits.  However,
  this process is ongoing and the FEC will continue to assess whether recovery audits
  are cost effective or applicable.

  assessments at least once every three years. The agencyâ€™s only program (FECA) is
  considered to be in Phase 1 and are not likely have an

  annual amount of improper payments (IP) plus an annual unknown payments (UP) above
  the statutory threshold. The FEC risk of improper payments has been low over the
  years as well as during the testing

  performed during the most recent risk assessment. Business processes have not changed
  during this cycle and the risk remains low. The overall risk was found to be low.'
