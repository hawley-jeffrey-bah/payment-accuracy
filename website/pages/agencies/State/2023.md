detail_ara2_1: 'The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS)
  has a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of
  activities performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of
  Oversight and Management Analysis (OMA). The subsequent review performed by OMA
  focuses on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture
  work performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform
  a secondary review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department
  by OMA. Because the OMA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that
  an external auditor would perform, OMA’s activity is considered recapture as defined
  by PIIA.


  Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments
  subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. OMA utilizes several processes that
  focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part
  of the Recapture Audit process, OMA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments
  using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against
  current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate
  payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has
  proven to be a cost-effective tool.


  In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, OMA performs a manual quarterly review
  of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate
  elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure
  proper documentation exists to support sampled payments.'

  The Office of Global Compensation (CGFS/GC) leverages an overpayment unit to review,
  calculate, and notify employees of salary or allowance overpayments. Salary overpayments
  occur for various reasons in the Department’s complex global pay environment, much
  is dependent on timely notification of events impacting pay. For example, late receipt
  of a cable notifying CGFS that an employee departed an overseas mission for official
  duty travel or on personal leave can result in an overpayment of allowances.

detail_dpa5: "The Department of State reviewed potential improper payments provided\
  \ by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments\
  \ through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2023, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed\
  \ 1,473,286 payments totaling $16.5 billion paid by the Department through the DNP\
  \ portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to\
  \ the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the\
  \ General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through\
  \ daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 170,708 unmatchable\
  \ payments, totaling $1.2 billion, and adjudicated 151 potential erroneous payment\
  \ matches totaling $639 thousand as part of the post payment review process. \n\n\
  The Department continued to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis\
  \ for all annuitant payments. At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant\
  \ database is screened against the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches\
  \ are researched and if confirmed, payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to\
  \ processing the monthly annuity payment run. In 2023, there were 204,870 annuitant\
  \ payments totaling $1.1 billion were reviewed against the DMF and 103 payments\
  \ totaling $661 thousand were stopped due to this initiative. This process is successful\
  \ in identifying deceased annuitants and ensuring improper payments are not made.\
  \ In addition, all annuity manual payments processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment\
  \ System are reviewed through the DMF online search prior to making payment. \n\n\
  For non-Treasury Disbursing Office oversees payments, payee information is checked\
  \ against Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially\
  \ Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2023, there were 2,624,564 payments totaling\
  \ $9.9 billion of potential payment matches reviewed resulting in no stopped payments.\n\
  \nIn addition, Department grants processed through the Health and Human Service\
  \ (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated\
  \ a review of the DNP portal into their payment process to identify individuals\
  \ or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax debt, a recipient that is listed as\
  \ deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded from doing business with the government.\
  \ In 2023, the Department was notified of no recipient that appeared ineligible\
  \ due to results of the DNP process. In addition, in 2023, four recipient payments\
  \ were stopped as a result of the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). The TOP is a centralized\
  \ offset program, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Debt Management\
  \ Services, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal agencies and states\
  \ (including past-due child support), in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) (collection\
  \ of debts owed to Federal agencies), 31 U.S.C. 3720A (reduction of tax refund by\
  \ amount of the debts), and other applicable laws."
detail_exs1: "Over the past decade, laws and regulations governing the identification\
  \ and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment\
  \ accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments\
  \ Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws,\
  \ collectively required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities\
  \ to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment\
  \ recapture audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives. The\
  \ IPIA regulations also required extensive reporting requirements. OMB transformed\
  \ the improper payment compliance framework to create a more unified, comprehensive,\
  \ and less burdensome set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced by the\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March 2,\
  \ 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured existing improper payments laws to help\
  \ agencies better identify and reduce any money wasted as a result of improper government\
  \ payments. Not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper payments represent\
  \ a loss to the government. Generally, an improper payment is any payment that should\
  \ not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under a statutory,\
  \ contractual, and administrative or other legally applicable requirement. \nThe\
  \ Department defines its programs and activities in alignment with the manner of\
  \ funding received through appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for\
  \ operations carried out around the world. Risk assessments over all programs are\
  \ done every three years. In the interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs\
  \ that experience any significant legislative changes and/or significant increase\
  \ in funding will be done to determine if the Department continues to be at low\
  \ risk for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels\
  \ set by OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment of all programs and activities\
  \ in 2022 and 2023 was the second year of the three year cycle. In 2023, the following\
  \ programs included: American Compensation; Voluntary Contributions; Temporary Duty\
  \ Travel; Diplomatic and Support Programs; Worldwide Security Protection; International\
  \ Security and Nonproliferation Programs; Population Refugees and Migration Programs;\
  \ and Educational Programs. After performing risk assessments for these programs,\
  \ the Department determined that none of its programs in 2023 were risk-susceptible\
  \ for making significant improper payments at or above the threshold levels set\
  \ by OMB. \nAnnually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented\
  \ on https:// paymentaccuracy.gov/ by individual agency or on a Government-wide\
  \ consolidated basis. This website contains current and historical information about\
  \ improper payments made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information\
  \ about how improper payments are defined and tracked. Please refer to the https://\
  \ paymentaccuracy.gov/ website for detailed results from the Department’s efforts\
  \ in 2023 to comply with PIIA.\n"
