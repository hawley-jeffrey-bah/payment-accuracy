  \ by the Department of the Treasury as a result of submitting disbursed payments\
  \ through the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal. In 2022, the Treasury reviewed and disbursed\
  \ 1,398,882 payments totaling $14.3 billion paid by the Department through the DNP\
  \ portal. Potential matches were provided on a daily basis, comparing payments to\
  \ the public Death Master File (DMF) of the Social Security Administration and the\
  \ General Services Administration’s Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). Through\
  \ daily access via the Treasury DNP portal, the Department reviewed 170,669 unmatchable\
  \ payments, totaling $1.5 billion, and adjudicated 74 potential erroneous payment\
  \ matches as part of the post payment review process. \n\nThe Department continued\
  \ to utilize the DNP portal’s DMF on a pre-payment basis for all annuitant payments.\
  \ At least twice each month the Department’s annuitant database is screened against\
  \ the DMF to identify deceased annuitants. All matches are researched and if confirmed,\
  \ payment to the annuitant is stopped prior to processing the monthly annuity payment\
  \ run. In 2022, there were 204,767 annuitant payments totaling $1.1 billion were\
  \ reviewed against the DMF and 71 payments totaling $320 thousand were stopped due\
  \ to this initiative. This process is successful in identifying deceased annuitants\
  \ and ensuring improper payments are not made. In addition, all annuity manual payments\
  \ processed through Treasury’s Secure Payment System are reviewed through the DMF\
  \ online search prior to making payment. \n\nFor non-Treasury Disbursing Office\
  \ oversees payments, payee information is checked against Treasury’s Office of Foreign\
  \ Assets Control’s (OFAC) list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN). During 2022,\
  \ there were 2,501,281 payments totaling $9.2 billion of potential payment matches\
  \ reviewed resulting in no stopped payments.\n\nIn addition, Department grants processed\
  \ through the Health and Human Service (HHS) Payment Management System (PMS) are\
  \ included in a DNP review. HHS incorporated a review of the DNP portal into their\
  \ payment process to identify individuals or entities with delinquent Federal non-tax\
  \ debt, a recipient that is listed as deceased on the DMF, and recipients excluded\
  \ from doing business with the government. In 2022, the Department was notified\
  \ of no recipient that appeared ineligible due to results of the DNP process. In\
  \ addition, in 2022, two recipient payments were stopped as a result of the Treasury\
  \ Offset Program (TOP). The TOP is a centralized offset program, administered by\
  \ the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s Debt Management Services, to collect delinquent\
  \ debts owed to the Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support),\
  \ in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) (collection of debts owed to Federal agencies),\
  \ 31 U.S.C. 3720A (reduction of tax refund by amount of the debts), and other applicable\
  \ laws.\n"
detail_exs1: 'Over the past decade, laws and regulations governing the identification
  and recovery of improper payments have evolved to strengthen improvements in payment
  accuracy and raise public confidence in Federal programs. The Improper Payments
  Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and expanded by other related laws, collectively
  required agencies to periodically review all programs and activities to identify
  those susceptible to significant improper payments, to conduct payment recapture
  audits, and to leverage Government-wide Do Not Pay initiatives.


  The IPIA regulations also required extensive reporting requirements. In recent years,
  OMB transformed the improper payment compliance framework to create a more unified,
  comprehensive, and less burdensome set of requirements. IPIA was repealed and replaced
  by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which was passed on March
  2, 2020. The PIIA modified and restructured existing improper payments laws to help
  agencies better identify and reduce any money wasted as a result of improper government
  payments. Not all improper payments are fraud, and not all improper payments represent
  a loss to the government. Generally, an improper payment is any payment that should
  not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under a statutory, contractual,
  and administrative or other legally applicable requirement. The Department defines
  its programs and activities in alignment with the manner of funding received through
  appropriations, as further subdivided into funding for operations carried out around
  the world. Risk assessments over all programs are done every three years. In the
  interim years, risk assessments evaluating programs that experience any significant
  legislative changes and/or significant increase in funding will be done to determine
  if the Department continues to be at low risk for making significant improper payments
  at or above the threshold levels set by OMB. The Department conducted a risk assessment
  of all programs and activities in 2022, including the following programs: American
  Compensation; Foreign Locally Employed Staff Compensation; Foreign Service Annuities;
  Voluntary Contributions; Assessed Contributions; Post-Assignment Travel; Temporary
  Duty Travel; National Endowment for Democracy; Economic Support Fund; Diplomatic
  Policy and Support; Diplomatic and Support Programs; Diplomatic and Consular, Terrorism
  related; Consular and Border Security Programs; Consular Information Technology
  and Security; Capital and Real Property Acquisitions Programs; Leaseholds and Functional
  Programs; Diplomatic and Consular, Other Programs; Overseas Programs; Worldwide
  Security Protection; International Security and Nonproliferation Programs; Security
  - Afghanistan, Pakistan; Physical Security Programs; Information Technology Central
  Fund Embassy Operations; Construction; Project Construction - Major Rehabilitation;
  International Security Programs; Population Refugees and Migration Programs; International
  Cooperative Administrative Support Services; Working Capital Fund Programs; Western
  Hemisphere Travel Initiative; Fulbright Program; Citizen Exchange Program; Educational
  Programs; Aviation, Anticrime, Interdiction and Related Programs; and Peace-Keeping
  Operations Programs. After performing risk assessments for these programs, the Department
  determined that none of its programs in 2022 were risk-susceptible for making significant
  improper payments at or above the threshold levels set by OMB.


  Annually, the Department submits data to OMB that is collected and presented on
  https://paymentaccuracy.gov/ by individual agency or on a Government-wide consolidated
  basis. This website contains current and historical information about improper payments
  made under Federal programs, as well as extensive information about how improper
  payments are defined and tracked. Please refer to the https://paymentaccuracy.gov/
  website for detailed results from the Department’s efforts in 2022 to comply with
  PIIA.'
