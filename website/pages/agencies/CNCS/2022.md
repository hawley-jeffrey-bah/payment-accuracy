  dollars.
detail_exs1: "In FY 2022 AmeriCorps saw a decline in its improper payment rate in\
  \ one of its four susceptible programs. The increases in the improper payments rate\
  \ from last year to this year are largely attributed to the operational challenges\
  \ that grantees continued to face related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically\
  \ related the administration of the temporary pay allowances that AmeriCorps allowed\
  \ during the period reviewed. The COVID 19 temporary pay allowances impacted the\
  \ Foster Grandparent and Senior Companion Programs. Increases in the RSVP program\
  \ are attributed to insufficient or unsupported salary allocations, specifically\
  \ the grantee’s inability to properly document staff time and effort on the federal\
  \ award. \nAmeriCorps State and National experienced a decrease in its improper\
  \ payment rates from last year to this year. The rate decrease can be attributed\
  \ to fewer instances of large improper payments. \n\nAll agency improper payments\
  \ are deemed outside the agency’s control. Although AmeriCorps is responsible for\
  \ recipient eligibility determinations, once grant funds are obligated, payment\
  \ and eligibility determinates are made at the grantee level.  \nAs part of its\
  \ strategic plan, AmeriCorps is prioritizing effective stewardship of federal resources.\
  \ \n\nThe agency specifically targeted improper payments and has created goals and\
  \ objectives aimed at reducing improper payments rates. A major step in this effort\
  \ is the establishment of an agency-wide Payment Integrity Corrective Action Plan\
  \ working group, which includes accountable program officials and key agency stakeholders.\
  \ Utilizing the Payment Integrity Assessment data, the working group created a corrective\
  \ action plan which defines goals and deliverables and identifies responsible parties\
  \ for carrying out key actions. The corrective action plan is monitored for progress\
  \ and refined as needed. The establishment of the working group represents a coordinated\
  \ effort by the agency to develop and implement corrective actions aimed at reducing\
  \ improper payments.\n"
