detail_CAP5: "For the program reporting rates over 10%, the OIG recommended AmeriCorps\
  \ include additional terms and conditions to its awardees to address the root causes\
  \ of improper payment and to implement financial consequences or additional reporting\
  \ requirements for grantees with improper or unknown payments. AmeriCorps has drafted\
  \ the language to include in the FY 2025 terms and conditions and will continue\
  \ to recover monies for collectable improper payments. \n\nAmeriCorps had audit\
  \ findings that it did not publish accurate or valid rates for ASN or FGP because\
  \ it does not include differences between filed Federal Financial Reports and general\
  \ ledgers as improper payments. The OIG recommends AmeriCorps reconcile the difference\
  \ between grantees’ internal account records and Federal Financial Reports or to\
  \ have the grantees perform the reconciliation during the payment integrity testing\
  \ cycle and report unmatched errors as unknown payments. AmeriCorps does not agree\
  \ that unmatched reporting errors represent improper payments as grantees have until\
  \ the close of their award to reconcile its accounting records. AmeriCorps does\
  \ not concur with the findings that resulted in the reported noncompliance. \n\n\
  AmeriCorps also received a finding that the National Service Trust (NST) improper\
  \ payment rate should have been reported in FY 2023. AmeriCorps did not concur with\
  \ this recommendation, as it reperformed a susceptibility analysis in FY2023 to\
  \ deem the NST susceptible, per an audit recommendation. Therefore, NST was not\

detail_ara2_3: AmeriCorps’ analysis determined payment recapture audits are not cost
  effective in any program or activity that expends over $1M annually. Therefore,
  no recoveries or distributions related to audit recoveries are applicable. AmeriCorps’
  processes include a significant amount of manual work required to identify and recapture
  overpayments. The agency does not recover the amount of money necessary to establish
  a self-funded recovery audit program.

detail_cap4: The agency has accountable officials that are responsible for different
  aspects of compliance with the payment integrity process. Payment integrity compliance
  may be tied to performance plans. Accountable officials will be invited to participate

detail_dpa3: My Agency did not identify any incorrect Information
detail_dpa5: AmeriCorps does not use the Do Not Pay Initiative in its payment integrity
  assessment for ASN and FGP, as all tested payments are made outside the agency by
  grantees. None of the datasets in the Do Not Pay Initiative allow AmeriCorps to
  validate payments made external to the agency by grantees. Trust payments are made
  to federal student loan servicing providers or educational institutions. The eligibility
  of those institutions is determined prior to payment. In FY 2024, AmeriCorps did
  not experience a reduction in improper payments due to the Do Not Pay initiative.
detail_exs1: "In fiscal year 2024, AmeriCorps is reporting three programs in Phase\
  \ 2 including AmeriCorps State and National (ASN), the Foster Grandparent Program\
  \ (FGP), and the National Service Trust. The scope of testing for ASN and FGP includes\
  \ grantee payments made in Q3 and Q4 of FY 2023 and Q1 and Q2 of FY 2024. The National\
  \ Service Trust’s (NST) testing scope is disbursements that occurred in FY 2023.\
  \ \n\nNone of the ASN or FGP improper payments made are within the agency’s control\
  \ and a majority of improper payments are due to inadequate record keeping and calculation\
  \ errors. AmeriCorps will reinstitute a corrective action plan committee to address\
  \ these root causes in FY 2025.\n\nThe ASN program had a slight decrease in improper\
  \ payment rates from FY 2023 which is attributable to variations in testing results\
  \ from random sample. \n\nAmeriCorps observed a significant increase in its FGP\
  \ program. This increase was a result of noncompliance identified with National\
  \ Service Criminal History Checks (NSCHC). Additional corrective actions will be\
  \ implemented in FY 2025.\n\nThe National Service Trust was in its first year of\
  \ phase 2 testing as a result of a finding in AmeriCorps’ Compliance with the Payment\
  \ Integrity Information Act of 2019 for FY 2023 audit. The majority of NST testing\
  \ included members (ASN) whose onboarding and service is managed and verified externally\
  \ to the agency by grantees as well as a subset of members (NCCC, some VISTA) whose\
  \ onboarding and service is managed and verified by the agency. The improper payment\
