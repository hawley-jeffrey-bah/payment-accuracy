      pre-award process and due diligence reviews. Once the agency obligates the grant
      funds, program participant and payment decisions are made at the grantee level.
      AmeriCorps does not review or approve grant expenses prior to payment. The agency
      is unable to prevent improper payments from occurring through agency systems
      or DNP before grantees make payments.

detail_agy1: AmeriCorps has demonstrated progress toward compliance in its last two
  fiscal years. One program, AmeriCorps Seniors RSVP, was moved from Phase 1 to Phase
  2 in FY 2023. Additionally, the agency observed significant reductions in improper
  payment rates in two of the three programs in Phase 2 in FY 2023. Due to the reduction
  in rates, AmeriCorps plans to move the Senior Companion Program to Phase 1 in FY
  2024.

detail_ara2_3: AmeriCorps’ analysis determined payment recapture audits are not cost-effective
  in any program or activity that expends over $1 million annually. Therefore, no
  recoveries or distributions related to audit recoveries are applicable. AmeriCorps’
  processes include a significant amount of manual work required to identify and recapture
  overpayments. The agency does not recover the money necessary to establish a self-funded
  recovery audit program.

  programs and other operations. AmeriCorps will continue the current processes to
  prevent improper payments, including grantee pre-award checks for organizational

detail_cap4: The agency has accountable officials that are responsible for different
  aspects of compliance with the payment integrity process. Payment integrity compliance
  may be tied to performance plans.
detail_com1: Non-compliant
detail_dpa1: 'Yes'
detail_dpa2: 'No'
detail_dpa3: My agency did not identify any incorrect information
detail_dpa5: AmeriCorps does not use the Do Not Pay Initiative in its payment integrity
  assessment as all tested payments are made outside the agency by grantees. None
  of the datasets in the Do Not Pay Initiative allow AmeriCorps to validate payments
  made external to the agency by grantees. In FY 2023, AmeriCorps did not experience
  a reduction in improper payments due to the Do Not Pay initiative.
detail_exs1: 'In FY 2023, AmeriCorps is in Phase 2 for AmeriCorps State and National,
  the AmeriCorps Seniors Foster Grandparent program, and the AmeriCorps Seniors Senior
  Companion program. The scope of testing includes grantee payments made in Q3 and
  Q4 of FY 2022 and Q1 and Q2 of FY 2023. None of the improper payments made are within
  the agency’s control and a majority of improper payments are due to inadequate record-keeping
  and calculation errors. AmeriCorps will reinstitute a corrective action plan committee
  to address these root causes in FY 2024.


  The AmeriCorps State and National program had an increase in improper payment rates
  of 0.5 percent, which is attributable to variations in testing results from random
  samples. The improper payment rate is within the upper and lower bounds of the FY
  2022 results and is not statistically significant.


  AmeriCorps Seniors observed significant decreases in its Foster Grandparent and
  Senior Companion programs. These decreases were due to the phase out of COVID-19
  related Temporary Pay Allowance, in which the agency observed significant gaps in
  documentation resulting in increases in improper payments in the past two fiscal
  years. In addition, there was a marked improvement in grantees using the agency-contracted
  vendors to perform National Service Criminal History Checks, reducing improper payments.
  Additionally, the agency instituted a regulation change in FY 2021 related to National
  Service Criminal History Checks, which resulted in a decrease in improper payments.

detail_pcp12_1: '2'
detail_pcp14: Management agreed to include the National Service Trust in the list

  terms and conditions, and develop and implement actions to reduce the improper payment
  rates below ten percent for FY 2023.
