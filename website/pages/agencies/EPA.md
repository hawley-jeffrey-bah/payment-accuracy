  - Barriers: The financial status of a grantee is rarely a problem for agency grants.
      Eighty percent of the agency's grants go state/local governments and research
      universities. For other grantees improper payments are often resolved by adjustments
      to payments or the return of funds.
    Info: In the Grants program the EPA determines eligibility criteria, as appropriate,
      when making the award determination. The determination occurs well before a
      grantee can draw any of the grant funds.

  AdditionalInformation: The EPA revised the weighting of the individual risk factors
    in its qualitative risk assessment to reflect the relative importance of each
    factor. In past two years, risk factors were placed in one of two weight tiers.
    In FY 2024 the risk factors were given percentage weighting range from 5% to 15%
    of the overall risk of 100%.

detail_ara2_3: 'The PIIA requires federal agencies to conduct payment recapture audit
  reviews on any program expending more than $1 million annually. The low dollar value
  of improper payments recovered by an external payment recapture auditor led to the
  determination it was not cost-effective either for the agency or for the contractor.
  As a result, the EPA no longer uses a payment recapture audit firm to conduct formal
  payment recapture audits.

  Nevertheless, the agency performs overpayment recovery activities internally, leveraging
  the work of agency employees and agency resources.'

detail_dpa5: 'The PIIA requires federal agencies to implement the Do Not Pay initiative,
  a government-wide solution designed to prevent payment errors and detect waste,
  fraud, and abuse in programs administered by the federal government. The EPA’s payments
  are screened by the Treasury’s DNP working system to detect improper payments. The
  Treasury analyzes each agency’s payments and provides a monthly report itemizing
  any payments that were made to potentially ineligible recipients. These potential
  matches are identified when the name of an agency’s payee matches the name of an
  individual or entity listed in federal data sources contained in the Treasury’s
  DNP working system.

  In FY 2024, the Treasury screened the EPA payments through the following DNP data
  sources on a post-payment basis: the Social Security Administration’s Death Master
  File and the General Services Administration’s System for Award Management Exclusion
  List. During FY 2024 a total of 226,737 EPA  payments worth $6.51 billion were screened.
  Of those payments, only one was identified as potentially improper. That payment
  was reviewed and adjudicated to be a proper payment.'
detail_exs1: "In FY 2024 the EPA was found compliant with the requirements of the\
  \ Payment Integrity Information Act by the agency's OIG. By the end of this fiscal\
  \ year, the one program (the Grants Program) identified as potentially susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments, was determined to not be susceptible as result\
  \ of a statistical sample of its payments. \nTo sustain the Payment Integrity at\
  \ the EPA, the agency maintains a proactive process of conducting regular risk assessments\
  \ of its programs and expecting regular, ongoing payment reviews. For practical\
  \ purposes, the EPA mostly aligns its programs by payment processes. Using that\
  \ as a starting point, each year, the agency reviews the funding and outlays’ mechanisms\
  \ of its programs, as well as each program’s purpose to determine if they are sufficiently\
  \ similar and appropriately sized for proper assessment. For example, a new program\
  \ could be split out from its current program area due to increase funding while\
  \ other programs could be merged when the overlap of their processes and/or significant\
  \ decreases in their funding become apparent.\nAll of EPA’s current programs are\
  \ assessed at least once every three years using a standard, qualitative risk assessment\
  \ survey tool. Any new program that has been in place for 12 months and has exceeded\
  \ $10 million in outlays per annum also completes the qualitative risk assessment.\
  \ The survey tool is based on risk factors outlined in the payment integrity statute\
  \ plus two other risk factors the agency added for potential concerns specific to\
  \ the EPA. \nPrograms that are determined to be susceptible based on the results\
  \ of the qualitative risk assessment, must then carry out (quantitative) transacting\
  \ testing using a statistically valid sample of its payments to determine if there\
  \ is in fact a significant level of improper payments. If the results of the sample\
  \ conclude the program is making a significant level of improper payments, it must\
  \ develop and carry out a corrective action plan to reduce the level of improper\
  \ payments. This process repeats annually for susceptible programs until the it\
  \ is no longer making a significant amount of improper payments.\nIn FY 2024, the\
  \ EPA completed risk assessments on three of its programs. Two programs, the Clean\
  \ School Bus – Rebates program and the agency’s Settlements program completed qualitative\
  \ risk assessments using the survey tool. The results of these risk assessments\
  \ determined that neither program is likely to be susceptible to significant improper\
  \ payments. Nonetheless, through this risk assessment process, the CSB – Rebates\
  \ program identified some challenges to its payment processes, and opted to begin\
  \ countermeasures to address them prior to the formal completion of the risk assessment\
  \ process.\nThe third program, the agency’s Grants program had been identified in\
  \ the FY 2023 as potentially likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments\
  \ based the results of the qualitative risk assessment completed that year. In FY\
  \ 2024, the program completed a review of a (statistically valid) sample of its\
  \ payments. The results showed it had an improper payment rate of 0.77% which is\
  \ below the susceptibility threshold of 1.5% of its payments.\nIn addition to annually\
  \ reviewing how the EPA breaks out its programs, each program is required to continuously\
  \ review its payments to determine if there have been any improper payments. For\
  \ any overpayments identified, the programs pursue recovery of those funds. \nA\
  \ second and third statistical sample occurred in the Clean Water State Revolving\
  \ Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). In recent years\
  \ the each SRF has completed a ‘50-state’ judgmental sample of the payment draws\
  \ as a part of its payments reviews. \nAdditionally, in Fiscal Year 2024, due to\
  \ the significant funding increase from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\
  \ (IIJA) together with the statute’s expansion of funding for water systems' related\
  \ work (such as lead pipe service line replacement and addressing emerging contaminants),\
  \ although not required, the EPA decided to complete statistical samples for the\
  \ CWSRF and DWSRF programs that received IIJA funding. Each statistical sample also\
  \ layered in judgmental samples to further assure that each state would have at\
  \ least one of each payment type reviewed.\nLooking forward to FY 2025, as examples\
  \ of two proactive measures, rather than merely doing qualitative risk assessments,\
  \ the EPA will conduct the more rigorous statistical sampling of two new programs\
  \ (Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds and Environmental Justice Grant Funds) that have\
  \ received substantial resources under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure\
  \ Investment and Jobs Act.\n"

detail_pcp14: "In the Environmental Protection Agency's most recent PIIA annual compliance\
  \ review, the Office of Inspector General’s reported the agency \"has made progress\
  \ in resolving corrective action plans and efforts to prevent and reduce improper\
  \ payments from prior audit recommendations, but Agency corrective actions are still\
  \ in process. The Agency satisfied these requirements for PIIA compliance for FY\
  \ 2023 but has an opportunity to improve internal controls to provide better oversight\
  \ of its payment integrity activities.\"\nAs a result of its review, the OIG recommended\
  \ that:\n(1)\tThe chief financial officer develop guidance for generating and maintaining\
  \ documentation to support risk assessment determinations of whether EPA programs\
  \ are susceptible to significant improper payments. \n(2)\tThe EPA should develop\
  \ oversight guidance and mechanisms to monitor the resolution of unknown payments,\
  \ as well as develop processes and tools to periodically collect and analyze agencywide\
  \ payment integrity activities and related information for preventing and reducing\
  \ improper and unknown payments. \nThe EPA has agreed to these recommendations and\
  \ implemented them in June of this year.\n"
