  AdditionalInformation: "USAGM made a change to our Improper Payment methodology\
    \ for the FY 24 reporting period.  In prior years, USAGM's risk assessment methodology\
    \ included a comprehensive quantitative risk assessment of 145 sampled payments\
    \ per program on a three-year rotational cycle of all agency programs with annual\
    \ outlays of $10M or more during the assessment cycle.  USAGM uses an alternative\
    \ assessment cycle from Quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through Quarter 3 of\
    \ the current fiscal year. \n\nUSAGM conducted an analysis of identified improper\
    \ payments from sampling testing between FY20 and FY23, showing consistently low\
    \ error rates. The quarterly self-reported data on improper payments ranged from\
    \ about 2% to 4% annually, primarily linked to payroll deductions (reviewed through\
    \ self-reported program review).\n\nGiven the low rates in previous years, USAGM\
    \ reduced testing to forty samples per year for each entity as part of a three-year\
    \ risk assessment cycle, in line with the Payment Integrity Information Act of\
    \ 2019. We will continue to implement thorough controls for self-reporting and\
    \ program reviews, demonstrating a commitment to strengthening oversight and ensuring\
    \ compliance with regulations to minimize the risk of improper payments."

detail_ara2_3: USAGM does not perform recovery audits due to programs not being susceptible
  to improper payments and USAGM’s payment composition of large volume, low dollar
  payments. Our analysis showed that the manual labor cost required to identify and
  recover an improper payment generally outweighs the amount that can be recovered.

  data sources during Payment Integration (or at the time of payment).  All funds
  disbursed by the Department of Treasury go through Payment Integration, in which

  USAGM loads the SAM file into the Momentum accounting system daily.  Any issues
  are identified when the file is loaded and resolved before payments are processed.

detail_exs1: "USAGM’s Inspector General concluded that the agency was compliant with\
  \ the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance\
  \ audit.  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities\
  \ with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least\
  \ once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.\
  \  Annually, USAGM conducts improper payment risk assessments of all programs on\
  \ a three-year rotational schedule for the period.  In FY 2024, USAGM conducted\
  \ improper payment risk assessments for three programs and determined they were\
  \ not susceptible to significant improper payments.  Additionally, risk assessments\
  \ will be for programs that undergo significant legislative changes or substantial\
  \ increases in funding, to determine if the agency remains at low risk for making\
  \ improper payments at or above the threshold levels established by PIIA.  Finally,\
  \ USAGM maintains payment integrity through strong prepayment controls and continuous\
  \ monitoring. \n\nUSAGM's FY 2024 recovery rate differs significantly from the FY\
  \ 2023 recovery rate due to the recovery of a large overpayment in the FY2023 assessment\
  \ cycle.  \n"
