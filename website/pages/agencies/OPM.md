Eligibility_Themes:
- Program_Name: Federal Retirement Services
  Themes:
  - Barriers: The status of an annuitant's death sometimes goes unreported.   RS relies
      on annuitant's family members and other sources for proof of death. The delayed
      receipt of proof and sometimes no proof of death can result in an improper payment.
    Info: To determine whether an applicant or recipient meets the Deceased eligibility
      criteria, we are required to validate proof of death.  The date of death or
      proof of death notification is not always timely.  The annuitant is only eligible
      for an annuity up until the date of death.
    Theme: Deceased
  - Barriers: Attrition and a lack of continuous funding impede efforts to modernize
      systems used for calculating benefits. Retirement Services leadership and the
      Office of the Chief Information Officer have collaborated to develop a comprehensive
      IT modernization cost estimate and are currently seeking additional funding
      to enhance process automation.  The FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification
      includes $6.5 million for improving the online retirement application and digital
      file system.  Moreover, the OPM leadership has submitted a second funding request
      for the Technology Modernization Fund which is currently in phase 1.
    Info: None of the predefined eligibility themes adequately represent the causes
      of Retirement Services' underpayments. The underpayments result from administrative
      and process errors, primarily due to the manual components of OPM’s annuity
      calculations, which are susceptible to human error (e.g., incorrect effective
      dates or salary rates). Improving internal staff education remains the most
      relevant proxy for addressing underpayments.

detail_CAP5: "In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB\
  \ Program was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements\
  \ (3, 4, 5b and 6).    \n\nThe OIG determination was based upon the FEHB Program\
  \ not reporting an Improper Payment Estimate in FY 2023. The OIG recommended OPM\
  \ issue an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefit program\
  \ that will allow OPM to be in compliance with PIIA reporting requirements in future\
  \ reporting years. \n\nOPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed for\
  \ OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management\
  \ and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB Program.\
  \  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to significant\
  \ improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in FY 2023.  OPM\
  \ immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.  While developing\
  \ the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program should be differentiated\
  \ into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The FEHB Program has different\
  \ contracts, payment structures, and improper payment types for the Experience-Rated\
  \ Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting meaningfully different sampling\
  \ and estimation methodology plans. Off-cycle risk assessments were conducted for\
  \ both new activities, with only the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments.  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was\
  \ not determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, OPM is not\
  \ required to report an improper and unknown payment estimate.\n\nOPM developed\
  \ a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency\
  \ stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM\
  \ issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal\
  \ Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting\
  \ and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting\
  \ for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper\
  \ payment reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting\
  \ and Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public\
  \ Accountants. OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology,\
  \ as the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report\
  \ their data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025."

detail_dpa5: 'OPM''s Retirement Services (RS) uses the Do Not Pay (DNP) Initiative,
  in conjunction with other methods, monthly to detect, prevent, and reduce improper
  payments. OPM''s RS Fraud Analysts access the DNP portal monthly, pulling nationally
  reported deaths of annuitants through the following death data sources: Department
  of State (DOS); Department of Defense (DOD); American Infosource (AIS) – Probate,
  American Infosource (AIS) - Obituary; and the full Death Master File (DMF). There
  were over 40,000 hits/names/payments reviewed in FY 2024. All hits/names/payments
  were verified by Fraud Analysts through open and closed source investigative tools.
  In FY 2024, over 4,500 names were confirmed deceased and dropped for death, preventing
  over $8,500,000.00 in improper annuity payments from being issued.


  FEHB uses the Do Not Pay (DNP) portal once a year, in February/March, to check new
  carrier applicants in the FEHB Program. OPM did not identify any incorrect information.

detail_exs1: "OPM is committed to advancing a transparent, accountable, and collaborative\
  \ financial management environment to fulfill its federal requirements and provide\
  \ stakeholders with accessible and actionable\nfinancial information. An essential\
  \ part of this commitment is the continuous improvement of payment accuracy in OPM’s\
  \ programs and robust internal controls. OPM continues to implement solutions to\n\
  prevent, detect, and reduce improper payments while reducing its stakeholders’ unnecessary\
  \ administrative burden.\n\nOPM's Inspector General concluded that the agency was\
  \ non-compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the\
  \ most recent compliance audit.\n\nPIIA requires the agency to review and assess\
  \ all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper\
  \ payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to\
  \ significant improper payments. OPM conducts improper payment risk assessments\
  \ on a three-year cycle, or more often if there are significant changes in the program.\
  \ In FY 2023 OPM conducted improper payments risk assessments for four programs.\
  \  All programs analyzed this FY remained Phase I programs.  OPM continues to only\
  \ have two Phase II programs; Retirement Services and Federal Employee Health Benefits\
  \ Experience Rated Carriers.\n\nOPM's Retirement Services improper and unknown rate\
  \ is 0.33 percent. The improper payment rate is 0.32 percent. The tolerable rate\
  \ is 0.38 percent. RS is aware of the improper payment drivers; however, systemic\
  \ limitations prevent RS from providing the survey's requested level of specificity.\
  \ OPM’s systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities\
  \ of data. There are overpayments that are\nthe result of annuitant's family members\
  \ and other sources failing to report annuitant's death. However, as our on-going\
  \ internal control activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential\
  \ improper payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify\
  \ discrepancies that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security\
  \ Administration’s (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared\
  \ with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased\
  \ by SSA. The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order\
  \ to terminate Federal benefits and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection\
  \ actions are initiated for any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death\
  \ Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity\
  \ roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF). OPM also utilizes Treasury's Do Not\
  \ Pay Portal to identify annuitants that should have been reported as deceased.\n\
  \nIn the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program\
  \ was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements:  \n1)\t\
  Published improper payment and unknown payment estimates for programs susceptible\
  \ to significant improper payments and unknown payments in the accompanying materials\
  \ to the annual financial statement.\n2)\tPublished corrective action plans for\
  \ each program for which an estimate above the statutory threshold was published\
  \ in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.\n3)\tDemonstrated\
  \ improvements to payment integrity or reached a tolerable improper payment and\
  \ unknown payment rate.\n4)\tReported an improper payment and unknown payment estimate\
  \ of less than 10 percent for each program for which an estimate was published in\
  \ the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.\nOPM is expeditiously\
  \ implementing the actions needed for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting. \
