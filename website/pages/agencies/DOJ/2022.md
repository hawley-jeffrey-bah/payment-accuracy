detail_agy1: The Department’s payment recapture audit program is part of its overall
  program of internal control over disbursements.  The program includes (1) establishing
  and assessing internal control to prevent improper payments, (2) reviewing disbursements
  to identify improper payments, (3) assessing root causes of improper payments, (4)
  developing corrective action plans, and (5) tracking the recapture of improper payments
  and disposition of recaptured funds. The Department also performs a risk assessment
  annually, which is more than is required by OMB guidance.
detail_ara2_1: The Department has used all of the methods identified in the prior
  questions, as well as other techniques, to recover overpayments identified through
  recovery audit activities. This includes the U.S. Department of Treasury's reclamation
  process, mailed notice/letter, electronic notice/letter, legal/judgement collection,
  contract suspension, and in-person collection.
detail_ara2_2: The Department has a high rate of recovery. Nonetheless, in some instances,
  overpayments identified through recovery audit activities are deemed not collectible.

detail_arp17: A significant percentage of the Department's overpayments results from
  disallowed costs identified through grant audits. Other overpayments result from
  control deficiencies or errors in processing invoices.

detail_dpa5: The Department of Justice has access to all DNP data sources that are
  helpful in identifying potential improper payments and awards.  The Department’s
  use of the sources in FY 2022 identified one improper payment totaling $50,000.  The
  Department attributes the very low rate to the strength of the prepayment controls
  in place within the Department’s components and built into the financial systems.
detail_exs1: The Department of Justice (DOJ) does not currently have any programs
  with annual outlays over $10M; therefore, under Payment Integrity Information Act
  of 2019 (PIIA), DOJ does not have any programs that are susceptible to significant
  improper payments. The Department operates a Payment Recapture Audit Program, in
  accordance with OMB A-123 Appendix C and PIIA, which includes execution of an annual
  improper payment risk assessment to determine susceptibility to improper payments
  and performing payment recapture and recovery activities on an annual basis.
