detail_ara2_1: The Department has used all of the methods identified in the prior
  questions, as well as other methods, to recover overpayments identified through
  recovery audit activities. This includes the US Dept of Treasury's reclamation process,
  mailed notice/letter, electronic notice/letter, legal/judgement collection, contract
  suspension, and in-person collection.
detail_ara2_2: The Department has a high rate of recovery. Nonetheless, in some instances,
  overpayments identified through recovery audit activities are deemed not collectible.
  This includes management approved write offs, exhausted all options for collection,
  system errors, and rounding errors.

  control deficiencies or errors in processing invoices.

detail_dpa5: The Department of Justice has access to all DNP data sources that are
  helpful in identifying potential improper payments and awards.  The Department’s
  use of the sources in FY 2023 identified three improper payments totaling $190,000.  All
  three payments were beneficiary payments under the Civil Division’s programs.  In
  each case, we are working with very sick individuals and sometimes between the time
  the decision is made to make a payment and the time the payment is received, the
  person passes. In each case, we work closely with the beneficiary’s family and a
  legal team to recoup the funds. The Department has been working with DNP Analytics
  team to analyze potential matches identified.  We hope that this deeper analysis
  will minimize the number of false positives.
detail_exs1: The Department of Justice (DOJ) does not currently have any programs
  with annual outlays over $10M; therefore, under PIIA, DOJ does not have any programs
  that are susceptible to significant improper payments. The Department operates a
  Payment Recapture Audit Program, in accordance with OMB A-123 Appendix C and Payment
  Integrity Information Act of 2019, which includes execution of an annual improper
  payment risk assessment to determine susceptibility to improper payments and performing
  payment recapture and recovery activities on an annual basis.
