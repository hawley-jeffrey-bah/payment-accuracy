    Answer: "504 loans are reviewed at the time of approval. 504 loans are available\
      \ through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), SBA's community-based partners\
      \ who regulate nonprofits and promote economic development within their communities.\
      \ CDCs are certified and regulated by SBA. Loans may be disbursed up to four\
      \ (4) years after the original approval date. These loans are generally made\
      \ to the right recipient for the right amount, but the approval process failed\
      \ to follow all statutes and regulation. In these cases, there is no amount\
      \ that needs to be recovered. However, because the CDC lender failed to adhere\
      \ to all applicable statutes, the loan is considered technically improper. At\
      \ the time of loan approval, no monies are disbursed. Improper payments identified\
      \ during loan review result in no monetary loss to the government.\n\nThe primary\
      \ reasons for 504 approval improper payments in FY 2023 included:\n•\tLender’s\
      \ failure to determine proper amount or source of equity injection; \n•\tLender’s\
      \ failure to adequately determine proper use of proceeds; and\n•\tLender’s failure\
      \ to properly determine borrower’s overall eligibility given SBA Size Standards\n"

    Answer: In FY 2023, one 504 loan was identified as an unknown payment in the amount
      of $1,462,000.  The CDC did not provide sufficient information for SBA to determine
      whether the borrower for this loan was eligible.
    Heading: Causes of Improper Payments
    Key: cyp8
    SortOrder: 29
    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: SBA
    Answer: "Because 504 loans are usually reviewed prior to monies being disbursed,\
      \ resolution of an identified improper payment is usually through obtaining\
      \ additional documentation from the CDC to remedy the potential improper payment\
      \ or through cancellation of the loan. There is no monetary outlay at approval,\
      \ and thus no loss to the Federal Government. Specific corrective actions on\
      \ loans reviewed are tracked at the loan level through a centralized database.\
      \  SBA anticipates that training and internal collaboration will continue to\
      \ be effective.  \n\n"

    Answer: "7(a) Loan Guaranty Approvals describes the loan guaranty approval process.\
      \ SBA does not make loans directly to borrowers:  SBA provides a guaranty to\
      \ a lender which makes the loan to a borrower. SBA delegates authority to certain\
      \ lenders to process, close, service, and liquidate certain 7(a) loans without\
      \ prior SBA review. Approximately 80 percent of 7(a) loans are approved by lenders\
      \ under their delegated authority. At the time of loan approval, no monies are\
      \ disbursed. Improper payments identified during loan review result in no monetary\
      \ loss to the government. During the loan guaranty approval review process,\
      \ the SBA reviews the 7(a) loan for calculation accuracy to ensure lenders issued\
      \ the 7(a) loans to eligible borrowers and to ensure loans are made within statutory,\
      \ regulatory, and SBA issued guidelines.   \n\nIn two of the three loans in\
      \ the sample identified with improper payments, the lender failed to document\
      \ or determine adequate debt service coverage, based on SOP requirements. In\
      \ the remaining loan identified as an improper payment, the lender failed to\
      \ meet loan refinancing requirements as stated in the SOP. \n\n. 7(a) loans\
      \ are reviewed at the time of approval; these loans are generally made to the\
      \ right recipient for the right amount, but the approval process failed to follow\
      \ all statutes and regulation. In these cases there is no amount that needs\
      \ to be recovered. However, because the lender failed to adhere to all applicable\
      \ statutes, the guaranty is considered technically improper.\n\nBecause the\
      \ improper payments for these 7(a) approvals are technically improper, the OMB\
      \ root cause is identified as Statutory Requirements of Program Were Not Met.\n\

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: SBA
    Answer: The root cause of overpayments on the COVID EIDL program was failure to
      access data/information. The most prevalent causes of improper payments stemmed
      from missing verification of business ownership, incorrect accounting of duplication
      of benefits, missing franchise documentation, and incorrect calculation of economic
      injury.  The loan originations and subsequent disbursement of loan funds to
      eligible borrowers for a correct amount in material compliance with the Loan
      Authorization and Agreement, SBA regulations, state and federal laws, Standard
      Operating Procedures (SOPs), COVID EIDL program guidelines, and other applicable
      SBA guidance, is within the agency's control.

    Answer: "The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans\
      \ to provide economic relief to small businesses and incentivize small businesses\
      \ to keep their workers on the payroll because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The\
      \ PPP loans can be forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs, interest\
      \ on mortgages, rent, utilities, or other eligible expenses. A borrower can\
      \ apply for forgiveness once all loan proceeds for which the borrower is requesting\
      \ forgiveness have been used. \n\nSBA reviewed the forgiveness applications\
      \ and documentation from lenders for forgiveness already paid to the borrower.\
      \  If SBA determined that the loan was not eligible for forgiveness (in whole\
      \ or in part), the payment was considered to be improper; the PPP loan is no\
      \ longer deferred; and, the borrower must begin paying principal and interest."

    Answer: In response to the FY 2023 PIIA Compliance Audit conducted by OIG, the
      SBA separated PPP into three payment integrity reporting categories – PPP Approvals,
      PPP Forgiveness, and PPP Purchases, and subsequently initiated the improper
      payments review process shortly after. SBA generated the loan sample and requested
      supporting documentation from lenders. In many instances, PPP loans forgiveness
      requests were submitted via SBA’s forgiveness platform and, although the lenders
      and borrowers were required to retain supporting documentation, they were not
      required to submit that documentation to SBA. For several of the PPP loans reviewed
      as part of the forgiveness sample, lenders had to request documents from borrowers.
      SBA asked lenders to submit their documents as soon as possible. As a result
      of the compressed time between documentation requests and reporting improper
      payment rates, many borrowers and lenders were unable to provide complete documentation.
      Those PPP loans with documentation requests outstanding were categorized as
      “Unknown” payments since SBA did not have sufficient supporting documentation
      to make a determination as to whether the forgiveness payment was proper or
      improper.
