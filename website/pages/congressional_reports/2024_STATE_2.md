SurveyData:
- Answer: 'The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) has
    a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of activities
    performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of Management
    Analysis (MA). The subsequent review performed by MA focuses on overpayments and
    utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work performed. While many
    agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary review, this
    function is performed more efficiently within the Department by MA. Because the
    MA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external auditor
    would perform, MA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.


    Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments
    subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. MA utilizes several processes that
    focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part
    of the Recapture Audit process, MA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments
    using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against
    current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate
    payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has
    proven to be a cost-effective tool.


    In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, MA performs a manual quarterly review
    of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate
    elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure
    proper documentation exists to support sampled payments. However, in 2024, MA
    vendor recapture audit efforts identified $23 in overpayments, and only $12 was
    recovered and returned to the originating appropriation. MA also performs a quarterly
    manual recapture audit of employee claim payments subject to the Department’s
    overall travel program. This recapture audit focuses on known identified issue
    areas as well as providing overall audit coverage of employee travel payments.


    During 2024, MA built on prior year recapture audit activities by targeting additional
    payment aspects to ensure all document types are eligible for review. In addition,
    MA reviewed grant payments within the universe of the domestic and overseas payment
    program. The additional inclusion of automated and manual recapture audit processes
    ensures the Department has coverage in required PIIA recapture audit areas.
