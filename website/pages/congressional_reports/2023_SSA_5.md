- Answer: 'We meet the recovery activities program requirements of Payment Integrity
    Information Act of 2019 for our benefit programs.  We have no plans to conduct
    payment recapture audits or contract for a private sector payment recapture auditing
    firm because of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental
    Security Income (SSI) programs’ complexity.  We conducted extensive market research
    prior to deciding not to use external auditors.  We put out a Request for Information
    and received approximately 15 responses.  We interviewed all of the respondents,
    who agreed that they could not match our benefit payments internal controls and
    audit mechanisms because of the complexity of our programs.  The typical claims
    specialist (our principal benefits reviewer, authorizer and adjudicator position)
    receives an average of 13 weeks of training prior to entering the job and does
    not achieve journeyman status until they have been on the job for 2 years.


    We have a comprehensive debt collection program.  We collected $4.9 billion in
    fiscal year (FY) 2023 at an administrative cost of $0.08 on average per dollar
    collected.  To recover overpayments, we use internal debt collection techniques
    (i.e., payment withholding, billing, and follow up), as well as some external
    collection techniques authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996
    for OASDI debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 for SSI debts.


    We developed a system to use the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), credit bureau
    reporting, and Administrative Wage Garnishment collection mechanisms for delinquent
    debts.  Because the system includes more than TOP and is the basis for any future
    collection interfaces with outside agencies or entities, we call it the External
    Collection Operation system.


    As resources permit, we are making improvement in other aspects of our debt collection
    program.  In FY 2018, we began modernization efforts to build a new Debt Management
    System.  This information technology investment is a multiyear effort intended
    to build a comprehensive overpayment system enabling us to record, track, collect,
    and report our overpayments more efficiently.


    The Federal Government uses the reclamation process to recover benefit payments
    paid via direct deposit to the financial account of a beneficiary who died and
    is not entitled to the payment, became legally incapacitated, or who died before
    the date of the payment(s).  To recover OASDI and SSI payments from U.S. financial
    institutions, we must send reclamation requests within 120 days of the date we
    learn of a beneficiary’s death.  A financial institution may protest a recovery
    of funds if we did not initiate the reclamation timely.


    For Administrative Payments, our current recovery activities program is a proven
    cost-effective means for evaluating payment accuracy and identifying improper
    payments.  In 2013, we contracted with a private sector recovery auditing firm
    on a contingency fee basis to review our administrative payments.  The firm based
    its review on past industry experience of improper payment rates, and a cost/benefit
    analysis of transactions processed by type and dollars paid.  Because of their
    minimal recovery, the auditors terminated the contract.'
