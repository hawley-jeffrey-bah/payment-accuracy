    Description_Action_Taken: Regular quality assurance audits were used to assess
      the accuracy of annuity payments. These audits were used to identify specific
      training needs and systemic deficiencies. For example, QA conducted an audit
      on claims processed, identified a training need, and subsequently provided targeted
      training to improve accuracy. The staff that completes the specific workload
      increased their knowledge base which impacts internal accuracy goals.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'OPM’s annuity calculations have automated and manual
      components. The manual components are subject to human error. Errors can include
      entering incorrect effective dates, salary rates, and/or tours of duty, which
      all impact annuity calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and developing
      target training

      improves accuracy which affects improper payments.'

    Action_Type: Audit
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: 'RS is aware of the improper payments; however, systemic
      limitations prevent RS from providing the needed level of specificity. OPM’s
      systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of
      data. Therefore, based on OMB''s predetermined root cause categories, only the
      category "failure to access data" applies. There are overpayments within the
      agency’s control that are are the result of annuitant''s family members and
      other sources failing to report annuitant''s death. The overpayments are considered
      to be within the agency''s control because RS has access to the death master
      file but does not

      access for each recurring payment. However, as our on-going internal control
      activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper
      payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies
      that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s
      (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s
      annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA.
      The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order to
      terminate Federal benefits and prevent

      subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for any overpayments
      that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly
      and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF).
      OPM also utilizes Treasury''s Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that
      should have been reported as deceased. Using these mechanisms, in FY 2023 Retirement
      Services collected $208.5 million in improper payments.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp6_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: Using the existing internal controls, human capital, and information systems
      and other infrastructure RS was able to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown
      Payments to the tolerable rate. The FY 2023 Improper Payments and Unknown Payments
      rate is 0.38 percent. The improper payment rate for overpayments was 0.24 percent.
    Needs2: An upgrade to the current legacy system is needed to categorize the root
      causes of improper payments properly. RS leadership is working on modernization
      initiatives to prevent improper payments. RS is working with OPM leadership
      to prioritize and identify funding. An IT Roadmap has been delivered, and the
      costs to modernize have been assessed through fiscal year 2028.
    Sufficiency: 'An upgrade to the current legacy system is needed to properly categorize
      the root causes of improper payments. A Retirement Services Information Technology
      Modernization Plan has been created. OPM sought to obtain funding via the Technology
      Modernization Fund (TMF) but was recently denied.

      Retirement Services leadership continues to be committed to modernizing and
      is currently working to prioritize and identify funding in FY 2024. RS was unable
      to properly categorize $85.34 million in overpayments. However, Retirement Services
      uses regular Quality Assurance audits to assess accuracy and the corresponding
      value of improper payments, as well as to identify any training or systemic
      deficiencies.


      Delayed reporting or sometimes no reporting by the annuitant''s family or other
      sources, can result in an improper payment. OPM conducts two matches to detect
      deaths that are unreported or delayed reporting of deaths. The Consolidated
      Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify

      annuitants who are reported as deceased by the SSA. The Validated Agency Match
      System processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits
      and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for
      any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File

      (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll
      and the SSA Death Master File (DMF).


      The improper payment rate decreased from FY 2022 to FY 2023 which demonstrates
      the effectiveness of the current corrective actions.'

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: OPM
    Answer: Overpayments within the agency’s control are generally the result of antiquated
      systems that fail to automate the processing of available intra-agency data
      while the payments are being processed. Additionally, the outdated systems fail
      to provide large quantities of specific data in order to pinpoint risk areas
      of improper payments. For example, overpayments occurred because the death data
      isn’t directly linked to the payment file to allow for immediate suspension
      of accounts. The overpayments are considered to be within the agency’s control
      because RS has access to the death data. The agency has put measures in place
      to mitigate improper payments to include annuitant surveys sent electronically
      or by mail to solicit eligibility. It also conducts a Consolidated Death Match
      (CDM), comparing the annuity roll to the full death master file from SSA on
      a weekly cadence, suspending and dropping accounts on the list that fail to
      respond to notices. The agency also utilizes Bureau of Fiscal Services’ Do Not
      Pay (DNP) portal, conducting monthly searches of annuitants who are reported
      as deceased through the death data sources (i.e. EVVE-FOD, DOD, DOS, AIS-OBIT,
      AIS-PROB, PACER, DMF-Public), verifying death and stopping further payments.

    Answer: Payments are unknown when it is discovered that additional information
      is needed to determine if the recipient is receiving the correct monthly benefit.
      Insufficient evidence can also result in unknown payments. Insufficient or missing
      information that affect the average salary and length of service are the most
      common reasons for unknown payments.

    Answer: Federal agencies are required to provide complete retirement packages.
      Through audits, the Quality Assurance Group identifies retirement claims that
      need additional information or clarification to determine if a recipient is
      receiving the correct monthly benefit. Insufficient or missing evidence can
      result in unknown payments. These types of errors can impact the amount of the
      improper payment amount. The improper payment amount is also impacted by the
      length of time it takes to receive sufficient information. The payment cannot
      be moved out of the unknown category and classified as proper or improper until
      all necessary documentation is received.
