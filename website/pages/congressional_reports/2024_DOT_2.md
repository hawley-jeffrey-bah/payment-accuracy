SurveyData:
- Answer: Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed the recovery
    audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2023 through March 2024. DOT
    considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal year 2024 audit to be
    recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s service provider, typically
    recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly from the payee, by offsetting
    a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt to the Department of Treasury’s
    Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover overpayments directly from the
    payees. In fiscal year 2024, recaptured overpayments resulting from DOT errors
    were returned to the program or activity’s original purpose.
