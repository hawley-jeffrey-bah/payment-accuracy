    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include developing new and enhanced
      claims' processing training and deploying training resources across various
      stakeholder groups to ensure more effective communication across target audiences.
      Additionally, VA will continue establishing and deploying enterprise-wide infrastructure
      solutions including reviewing the effectiveness of quality assurance and monitoring
      reporting processes and developing and implementing effective standardized processes.
      These actions were designed to reduce improper and unknown payment errors associated
      with statutory requirements of program were not met and unable to determine
      whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
      the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.

    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned include continuing with the post-implementation
      modernization of beneficiary travel claims processing systems. VA enhanced automation
      action plans to expand use of transportation modalities that will streamline
      third-party preauthorized claims processing, integrate medical qualifications,
      and automate contract execution. These actions were designed to address overpayments
      and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, and technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program not met. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error.

    Action_Type: Automation
    Completion_Date: The corrective action was not fully completed this reporting
      period
    Description_Action_Taken: Actions taken included continuing to implement new software
      that provides a customized and enhanced tool to streamline claims, automate
      eligibility determinations, payment processing, detection and prevention of
      improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing capabilities. In addition,
      VA continued with the post-implementation modernization of the beneficiary travel
      claims processing software and other systems. Further,VA continued planning
      for invoice payment processing nationwide, which is expected to improve the
      timeliness and accuracy of ambulance claims processing. Finally, VA transitioned
      from a legacy system to a new beneficiary travel claims processing system. Although
      the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY
      2024, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action implementation
      forward. These actions were designed to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted
      from manual processes and human error.

    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate the closest facility
      that could provide the Veteran's treatment was utilized, special mode transportation
      rates were correctly paid according to contract, if applicable, services were
      received, beneficiary met administrative and medical qualification, claim was
      timely submitted, claim was not a duplicate, or claim payments were calculated
      according to mileage and deductibles, if applicable. The agency has the direct
      ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving processes and controls
      surrounding administrative and medical qualifications, and simplifying contract
      pricing, when applicable, to include valid claim mileage calculations. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorizations, closest
      facility, and will ensure services are rendered, decreasing human error. These
      improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Subheading: Technically Improper Payments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
      to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
      and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the
      right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper approval on medical qualification.
      Specifically, where clinical documentation for special mode travel was not properly
      and timely approved by a VA clinician. Most improper payments resulted from
      delinquent authorizations and lack of proper approval on medical qualification.
      These resulted in technically improper payments for failing to comply with 38
      Code of Federal Regulations - Applications (Part 70.20), 38 Code of Federal
      Regulations - Criteria for approval (Part 70.4), and Federal Acquisition Regulation
      sections General (Part 1.601) and Policy (Part 43.102).

    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
      documentation related to authorization, receiving, eligibility, or pricing documentation
      that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or improper. Specifically,
      these unknown payments occur when the agency was unable to determine the Veteran's
      eligibility due to missing annual income documentation, medical authorization
      documentation, or incomplete contract price schedules. Without annual income
      eligibility, contract price schedules, receiving supporting documentation and
      special mode transportation or common carrier preauthorization documentation,
      if applicable, the program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is
      proper or improper.

    Answer: "The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement\
      \ corrective actions and mitigation strategies designed to reduce improper and\
      \ unknown payments. In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions\
      \ developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess\
      \ the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether\
      \ the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency.\
      \ The results for the Beneficiary Travel program indicated that of the four\
      \ actions assessed, three were designed effectively and one was designed ineffectively.\
      \ If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine\
      \ the program's mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root\
      \ cause(s) of error. \n\nThrough implementation of effective corrective actions\
      \ and mitigation strategies, Beneficiary Travel reduced overpayments from $88.50\
      \ million in FY 2023 to $86.22 million in FY 2024, or a $2.28 million reduction.\
      \ Additionally, Beneficiary Travel experienced a $91.78 million increase in\
      \ outlays, specifically in program areas where errors tend to occur. VA has\
      \ increased the sample size in this program area to gain additional insight\
      \ into the root error cause(s) occurring and plans to expand and enhance FY\
      \ 2024 corrective actions related to these high-risk program areas. For errors\
      \ tied to failure to access data/information, errors tied to statutory requirements\
      \ of program not met, and errors tied to errors tied to unable to determine\
      \ whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies\
      \ did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024. \n\nVA\
      \ will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action plans\
      \ developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop and\

    Answer: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the Office of Inspector
      General and reported improper and unknown payments below required thresholds
      for a compliance determination in FY 2025. In FY 2025, VA executive managers
      and program personnel will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments
      as appropriate. This will include various mitigation strategies such as automation
      and training. These actions address the root causes of errors found in FY 2024
      payment integrity testing. VA’s executive managers to include the Deputy Executive
      Director for Member Services and program personnel will be held accountable
      through annual performance criteria contained within their performance plans.
      Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all their duties. Depending
      on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can include preventing improper
      and unknown payments through effective internal controls, recovering overpayments
      if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts for known causes of improper
      and unknown payments. State and local governments are not involved in the execution
      of this program.

    Answer: 'The Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program prioritized and
      implemented effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of
      rate reductions and projections under the statutory threshold for significant
      improper payments of both 1.5% and amount over $10 million. Specifically, from
      FY 2023 to FY 2024, the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program decreased
      its improper and unknown error rate from 2.49% to 0.57% (a reduction of 1.92%)
      and improper and unknown payments from $53.09 million to $13.27 million ($39.82
      million reduction). In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the
      actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was
      to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized within
      the agency. The results for the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program
      indicated that of the five actions assessed, two were effective, two were designed
      effectively, and one was designed ineffectively. If improvements could be made,
      VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies
      to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $23.30 million in FY 2023 to $8.57 million in FY 2024, or
      a 63% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper,
      associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
      reduction in the unknown payment amount from $27.74 million in FY 2023 to $0.73
      million in FY 2024, or a 97% reduction. For errors tied to failure to access
      data/information, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies did
      not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2023 to FY 2024.


      Due to the program successfully reporting an error rate under 1.5% and improper

    Answer: This program was determined compliant in FY 2024 by the OIG and reported
      improper and unknown payments below required thresholds for a compliance determination
      in FY 2025. Given the FY 2024 reported improper and unknown payment rate is
      below statutory thresholds, the program will not be required to set or meet
      applicable reduction targets. However, in FY 2025, VA executive managers and
      program personnel will continue responsibilities for internal control outlined
      in the Government Accountability Office’s Green Book. VA’s executive managers
      to include the Executive Director of Acquisition and program personnel will
      be held accountable through annual performance criteria contained within their
      performance plans. Performance criteria will be unique to and inclusive of all
      their duties. Depending on each employees’ responsibilities, duties can include
      preventing improper and unknown payments through effective internal controls,
      recovering overpayments if appropriate, and implementing remediation efforts
      for known causes of improper and unknown payments. State and local governments

      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Medical
      Care Contracts and Agreements is able to validate the correct payment to be

    Answer: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was
      paid to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet
      all regulatory and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment
      was paid to the right person in the right amount, the purchase was made without
      a required contract or VA lacked evidence the purchase was made by an authorized
      individual. Specifically, there was a lack of request for procurement action
      when a contract was required for purchase or a purchase order was not approved
      by an authorized individual prior to the purchase which resulted in an unauthorized
      committment. This resulted in technically improper payments for failing to comply
      with VA Acquisition Regulations sections: Career Development, Contracting Authority,
      and Responsibilities/General (Part 801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering
      Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering Officers

    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
      documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing or missing documentation
      related to invoice submittal requirements. Specifically, the agency was unable
      to determine the appropriate pricing due to the lack of information in the contract
      price schedule, or insufficient information on the invoice to be able to determine
      the appropriate amount billed and paid. In addition, the agency was unable to
      determine if the required invoice submittal documentation was obtained per the
      contract. Without documentation supporting the appropriate information per the
      contract or per the invoice, the program is unable to determine whether the
      amount paid is proper or improper.

      VA used the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to match against

    Answer: 'VA overpayments are within the agency’s control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to correctly process beneficiary
      awards. These overpayments occurred for multiple reasons; however, the two main
      reasons are: (1) that beneficiaries failed to notify VA of changes and (2) human
      error. Claims processors can manually access Social Security Administration
      income information to calculate correct benefit amounts when a beneficiary notifies
      VA of a change. VA is improving administrative compliance by using the Social
      Security Administration income match; however, when a potential variance is
      identified, VA must continue to make the current benefit payment while determining
      whether the change in benefit is valid which results in potential overpayments.
      The program is also working with claims processing stations on the human errors
      identified each fiscal year. These improvements will result in increased payment
      accuracy.'

    Answer: If a benefit payment is identified as a potential overpayment and has
      yet to enter due process or is currently in due process, a determination of
      whether it is proper or improper cannot be made. VA must provide a 60-day due
      process period that protects a beneficiary’s rights to provide additional financial
      documentation which could potentially change or even eliminate a match to third
      party data indicating there was a change in income. Until due process is complete,
      VA cannot make a final determination and the payment must be classified as unknown.

    Answer: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. In FY 2024, VA performed
      an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented in FY 2023. The
      purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions
      or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented
      and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Pension program indicated
      that of the three actions assessed, one was open and determined to be designed
      effectively to mitigate the root cause, and two were open and determined that
      improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. VA conducted
      a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation strategies to ensure
      they address and reduce root cause(s) of error and added training to corrective
      actions planned for FY 2025. Additionally, VA obtained more details during payment
      integrity testing this year for the program to improve development of effective
      corrective actions. VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the
      corrective action plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time
      needed to develop and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process.
      Results of this review will be reported in FY 2025.

    Answer: 'The Pension program was determined noncompliant with PIIA for FY 2023
      by the OIG in May 2024. Additionally, the program is reporting improper and
      unknown payments above the required thresholds in FY 2024 for a compliance determination
      by the OIG in May 2025. In FY 2025, the Executive Director for Pension and Fiduciary
      Service will be focused on prevention and recovery of overpayments as appropriate.
      This will include various mitigation strategies such as audit, automation, and
      training. These actions will help bring the program into compliance by reducing
      errors associated with failure to access data/information and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. The Executive
      Director for Pension and Fiduciary Service’s performance plan includes performance
      metrics appropriate to ensure mission is met while still ensuring payment integrity.


      Generally, VA Senior Executives are held accountable via the performance appraisal
      process as established by VA’s Corporate Senior Executive Management Office.
      This process includes oversight from VA’s Performance Review Board, which evaluates
      each executive’s performance appraisal, the executive’s response to the initial
      summary rating, if any, and the results of any higher-level official’s findings
      and recommendations. Performance bonuses and/or salary increases are aligned

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate payment was made in
      accordance with the contract rate and in the appropriate amount per regulation,
      billed services did not exceed the authorized care, and claims were received
      within the required timeframes. For contract related instances, the Community
      Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA is invoiced
      in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines and VA is responsible
      to ensure the contract terms are met. The agency has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes,
      implementing system enhancements to include a prepayment check, and simplifying
      contract pricing. Additionally, system improvements will allow for automation
      of the review of claim data against the authorization, decreasing human error.
      These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Answer: VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
      to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
      and/or statutory requirements. Specifically, a valid contract or provider agreement
      was not in place when required for Community Nursing Home care. Most technically
      improper payments resulted from purchases being made without a contract utilizing
      a Basic Ordering Agreement, which is not a contract. These resulted in technically
      improper payments for failing to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation
      section Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General
      (Part 1.601) or VA MISSION Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-182).

      orders. Finally, the VA will restructure existing contracts and provide education
      and training to certifying officials for rejecting invoices that do not comply
      with contract requirements. These actions were designed to reduce overpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper. Change process
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal controls
      and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed. Specifically, overpayments occur
      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Supplies
      and Materials is able to validate the correct payment to be made per the invoice
      or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements will allow for more
      accurate payment validation.

  - Agency: VA
    Answer: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was
      paid to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet
      all regulatory and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment
      was paid to the right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper delegation
      for the order placed, VA lacked evidence that the order was placed by an authorized
      individual, or the contract was missing a required signature. Specifically,
      the ordering officer placed a funded order; however, the required written delegation
      was not in place at the time of the order. Also, a purchase order was not approved
      by an authorized individual prior to the purchase which resulted in an unauthorized
      committment. In addition, a contract administrative error occurred because the
      contract was missing a signature. These resulted in technically improper payments
      for failing to comply with VA Acquisition Regulations sections: Career Development,
      Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General (Part 801.601), Federal
      Supply Schedules/Ordering Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering

  - Agency: VA
    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had missing or insufficient
      payment documentation or information to validate the appropriate contract pricing.
      Specifically, the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due
      to the lack information in the contract price schedule or a proper invoice was
      missing. Without a proper invoice or documentation supporting the appropriate
      contract rate information, the program is unable to determine whether the amount
      paid is proper or improper.

      in accordance with the contract rate and in the appropriate amount per regulation,
      billed services did not exceed the authorized care, and claims were received
      within the required timeframes. For contract related instances, the Community
      Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA is invoiced
      in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines, and VA is responsible
      to ensure the contract terms are met. The agency has the direct ability to prevent
      overpayments from occurring by improving controls in the payment processes and
      simplifying contract pricing. These improvements will allow for more accurate

    Answer: 'The VA Community Care program continues to prioritize and implement effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper and unknown
      payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of reductions. Specifically,
      from FY 2023 to FY 2024, the VA Community Care program decreased its improper
      and unknown error rate from 4.92% to 1.90% (3.02% reduction) and improper and
      unknown payments from $992.38 million to $416.63 million ($575.75 million reduction).
      In FY 2024, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and
      implemented in FY 2023. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness
      of corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were
      effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the
      VA Community Care program indicated that of the eight actions assessed, seven
      were effective and one was designed effectively. If improvements could be made,
      VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation strategies
      to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $959.53 million in FY 2023 to $416.63 million in FY 2024,
      or a 57% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or
      improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
      to a 100% reduction in the unknown payment amount from $32.85 million in FY
      2023 to $0 in FY 2024.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2025 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2024 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions and to impact the payment process. Results of this review
