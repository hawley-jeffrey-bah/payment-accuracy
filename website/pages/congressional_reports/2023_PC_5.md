- Answer: "In general, the agency does not make large payments that would be considered\
    \ high risk (block grants, cost reimbursable contracts, payments in advance of\
    \ performance, mandatory benefits payments). \n\nAdditionally, Peace Corps performs\
    \ extensive advance certification reviews on any payments in excess of $2500 as\
    \ well as post payment audits of disbursements on a continuous basis. These preventative\
    \ and recovery activities are an effective and efficient way of identifying the\
    \ limited instances of overpayments. Conducting a formal recovery audit is not\
    \ deemed to be cost-effective."
