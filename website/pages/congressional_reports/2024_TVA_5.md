- Answer: 'For Payroll, management reviews and approves all time changes prior to
    payments being made.  Additionally, the program''s strong control environment
    precludes significant overpayments.


    Regarding the Credit Card Program, the agency leverages controls to help prevent
    overpayments. Merchant Category Codes manage where the credit card can be utilized.
    The credit card also maintains two different spend controls. The first is on the
    transaction, and the second is on the card''s total available spend. Finally,
    the agency''s account has a maximum spend threshold at the contract level, which
    is managed by the credit card merchant.'
