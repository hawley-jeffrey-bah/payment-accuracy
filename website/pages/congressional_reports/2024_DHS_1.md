Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: "The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility\
    \ to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper\
    \ payment, establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with the\
    \ Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and develops and implements\
    \ corrective actions. In previous years, the Department established a two-part\
    \ process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed by a comprehensive assessment\
    \ if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process is used on all programs\
    \ not already reporting an improper payment estimate and that meet the minimum\
    \ disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive risk assessment process\
    \ is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results and the program’s\
    \ three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive risk assessments,\
    \ Component personnel held meetings with program managers, key personnel, and\
    \ other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments. The Department’s\
    \ comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes that directly or\
    \ indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the Government Accountability\
    \ Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control (\"Green Book\") framework as well\
    \ as OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. \n\nAdditionally, the Department\
    \ conducts independent reviews of Component submissions to identify significant\
    \ changes in the program compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of\
    \ the risk ratings. In accordance with OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C guidance,\
    \ programs that are in Phase 2 and are preforming statistical testing and reporting\
    \ do not need to be subject to a risk assessment process and will continue to\
    \ be considered susceptible to significant improper payments until the program\
    \ can be reverted to Phase 1. Once reverted to Phase 1, programs would then be\
    \ subject to the three-year minimum requirement to undergo a DHS comprehensive\
    \ risk assessment."
