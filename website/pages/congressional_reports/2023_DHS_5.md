- Answer: 'DHS performs regular monitoring and conducts recovery activities throughout
    the year. As such, historical recovery audit efforts indicated that many identified
    overpayments had already been identified by the agency and thus were not applicable
    for recovery audit vendor commission. Given the low return on value for the recovery
    audit vendors, DHS was unsuccessful in keeping a vendor in place for this effort
    in previous years due to cost inefficiency for the vendor and for DHS.


    Based on additional cost-benefit analysis, DHS has examined the program structures,
    payment types and transaction volume, success rates in recoupment, as well as
    the expected cost incurred examining labor costs, clearance and equipment costs,
    commission payments, etc. Cost analysis reviews conducted to date have not successfully
    determined that any of the programs would be cost beneficial for recovery audit
    efforts. DHS continues to refine the information within the analysis, and if determined
    to be cost effective, will work through procurement channels to move forward with
    establishing a recovery audit mechanism going forward.'
