Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The Department performs risk assessments to determine susceptibility
    to improper payments, testing to estimate the rates and amounts of improper payment,
    establishes improper payment reduction targets in accordance with OMB guidance,
    and develops and implements corrective actions. In previous years, the Department
    established a two-part process comprised of a preliminary assessment followed
    by a comprehensive assessment if necessary. The preliminary risk assessment process
    is used on all programs not already reporting an improper payment estimate and
    that meet the minimum disbursement threshold of $10 million. The comprehensive
    risk assessment process is required based on the preliminary risk assessment results
    and the program’s three-year risk assessment cycle. In conducting the comprehensive
    risk assessments, Component personnel held meetings with program managers, key
    personnel, and other stakeholders to discuss the inherent risk of improper payments.
    The Department’s comprehensive risk assessment involves evaluating attributes
    that directly or indirectly affect the likelihood of improper payments using the
    GAO Standards for Internal Control (Green Book) framework as well as OMB Circular
    No. A-123, Appendix C guidance. Additionally, the Department conducts independent
    reviews of Component submissions to identify significant changes in the program
    compared to last year and assess the reasonableness of the risk ratings.
