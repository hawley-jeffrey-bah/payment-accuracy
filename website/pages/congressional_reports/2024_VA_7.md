- Answer: 'In May 2024, the VA Office of Inspector General found 71 VA programs fully
    compliant with PIIA. The Office of Inspector General found two programs noncompliant
    with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Pension and Purchased Long
    Term Services and Supports.


    The Pension program was found noncompliant with compliance criteria 6, achieving
    an improper payment and unknown payment rate of less than 10%. VA''s Inspector
    General recommended that the Pension program reduce improper and unknown payments
    to below 10%. The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments. Although the
    Pension program remains noncompliant and reported an increase in overall improper
    and unknown payments, the program underwent improvements in FY 2024 that will
    improve its ability to reduce improper and unknown payments in the future. This
    included updating testing procedures to correctly differentiate monetary loss
    from unknown payments, increasing detail obtained during testing to improve development
    of effective corrective actions, and improving corrective actions planned for
    FY 2025. Actions planned regarding automation include continuing quarterly matches
    with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social Security
    Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by
    a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary’s
    income, which could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether
    a change is needed and making changes, if necessary, prevents future improper
    payments. Ensuring accurate documentation of Social Security Administration income
    prevents future improper payments. Actions planned regarding audit include randomly
    reviewing claims processors’ work to ensure policies and procedures are properly
    applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments.
    Actions planned regarding training include training staff to ensure policies and
    procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decision to prevent
    future improper payments. Given the time it takes to implement corrective actions
    and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive impact of
    these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector General
    will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act
    of 2019 in May 2027. The Pension program tracks the measurable milestones included
    in its corrective action plan no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year,
    to ensure actions planned are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate
    risks of improper and unknown payments.


    In addition, the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program was found noncompliant
    with compliance criteria 6, achieving an improper payment and unknown payment
    rate of less than 10%. The Office of Inspector General recommended that the Purchased
    Long Term Services and Supports program reduce improper and unknown payments to
    below 10%. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues to
    prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies
    that reduce improper and unknown payments. Although the Purchased Long Term Services
    and Supports program remains noncompliant, the impact of the program changes in
    recent years is reflected in a decrease in the improper and unknown payment rate
    from 38.72% in FY2023 to 13.52% (for a 25.2% reduction) and a $657.90 million
    decrease in improper payments in FY 2024, despite increases in program spending.
    Actions planned regarding automation include updating the claims processing system
    to pay Bowel and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. Actions
    planned regarding change process include moving to a standardized rate schedule
    for Community Nursing Home payments in order to transition from a legacy system
    to an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifying
    payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct allowable
    rates, and will work to implement short- and long-term contracting options for
    Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements.
    Further, VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures
    and inability to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will establish
    Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. Actions planned regarding training
    include working internally with facilities to provide education and training to
    resolve missing documentation related to authorization, payment or Veteran level
    of care to support the payment process. Given the time it takes to implement corrective
    actions and mitigation strategies, the program expects the continued positive
    impact of these actions on FY 2025 payments and anticipates the Office of Inspector
    General will determine the program compliant with the Payment Integrity Information
    Act of 2019 in May 2028. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program
    tracks the measurable milestones included in its corrective action plan no less
    than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions planned are appropriately
    prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments.'
