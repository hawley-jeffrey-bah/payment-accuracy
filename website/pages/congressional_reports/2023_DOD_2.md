    Answer: 'Army Civilian Field Offices were unable to provide complete SF 1190s
      with authorizing signatures. Addressing the root causes for the samples determined
      Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that combined is above the
      statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is a combination
      of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions aimed at reducing the likelihood
      of Technically Improper or Unknown Payment errors occurring during the payment
      process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA)
      provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that block
      25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block
      26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army Command partners. Any SF 1190s that
      are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands
      to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review the requirements
      that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting existing SF 1190s),
      and will coordinate with our Command partners appropriately.


      An additional Department CAP has been created specifically for Department of
      Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard
      Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  Completion
      of the SF-1190 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount
      for all overseas allowances.  During the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 audit, the SF-1190
      was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found that the SF-1190 did not have
      consistent signatures and dates on the standard forms. DoDEA is in the process
      of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System
      (DAPS) which is to be housed on their internal ServiceNow network. With the
      upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled signatures and dates.'

    Answer: 'DoDEA is in the process of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA
      Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be housed on our internal ServiceNow
      network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled
      signatures and dates. Once the system modernization is implemented and operational,
      DoDEA will conduct an internal audit of Fiscal Year  2024 Quarter 2 and Quarter
      3 SF1190s to ensure that the modernization CAC enabled signatures and dates
      are operating effectively.


      For the Army Per the CHRA Leadership, effective immediately, the CHRA team will
      ensure that block 25 on SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA
      and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by the Army Command partners.
      Any 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated with
      Commands to ensure forms are correct.'

    Answer: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program will establish Defense

      Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) site and commercial pay system-specific
      working groups in fiscal year 2024. The primary purpose of this Department-wide
      working group initiative to ensure the creation of the new standard operating
      procedures and appropriate milestones are established to reduce technically
      improper and unknown payments associated with documentation retention to substantiate
      the payments. DFAS Post-Pay Review & Analysis team will provide training to
      review teams regarding proper documentation required for government credit card
      transactions. This Training will be provided to the review teams during the
      annual kick off meeting on the appropriate documentation required to complete
      sample packages along with specific examples of acceptable documentation.'

    Answer: The Department Commercial Pay Working Groups will collaborate to identify
      the repository systems for payments made under the Commercial Pay Program. Each
      Defense Finance and Accounting Service site responsible for payments under the
      Commercial Pay program will determine whether the program lacks information
      or data systems to confirm eligibility or provide for other payment integrity
      needs. Furthermore, the Department is establishing an additional Department-wide
      working group to perform a Risk Assessment to identify the causes and volume
      of technically improper payments made when regulatory and/or statutory requirements
      were not met to substantiate the payment.

    Answer: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay program cross enterprise sharing corrective
      actions will focus on the collaboration from various Components throughout the

      Department to bolster internal controls preventing improper payments. This Department
      endeavor will be fairly complex given the nature of commercial vendor payments
      coupled with existing accounting and contracting systems. Additionally, the
      Department will synchronize various efforts with the Treasury

      Department''s Payment Integrity resources and available tools.'

    Answer: The DoD Travel Pay Payment Integrity program will continue with collaborative  training
      sessions on the causes of improper payments, and remediation training for approving
      officials causing improper payments.  The Department will continue to ensure
      travel-related training is provided across the Department.  Error trend analysis
      will be leveraged to determines training focus areas.  Approving officials are
      provided remediation training and monitored for repeat improper payments.  If
      repeat improper payments are found, the approving official is removed from approval
      responsibilities.  A robotics program identifies and corrects unauthorized approval
      accesses, and personal granting these accesses are monitored for repeat offenses
      to remove from DTS duties.  The Department continues its focus on the benefits
      of effective management, internal controls, focused training, and accountability.

    Answer: The Military Pay - Army program's corrective action plan describes the
      Army National Guard identifying each Soldier’s State and United States Financial
      Pay Office (USFPO) to include their audit teams in order to obtain the required
      key supporting documents.  Additionally, if the Soldier was mobilized prior
      to time of payment, the mobilization platform supporting finance office will
      be contacted to request for the key supporting document.  Guidance will be provided
      to the States, USFPO, and Internal Review Offices to ensure key supporting documents
      are properly archived in the Soldier’s iPERMS account.

    Answer: "The Department's Military Retirement program will perform the following\
      \ corrective actions. \n1. Continue interagency collaborative efforts to correct\

      \ the Retired Pay account. These corrections will ensure Military Retirement\

      \ as continued enhancement of systems and focuses on automation. This will further\
      \ eliminate human evolvement and greatly reduce manual computation errors.\n\

- Answer: The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program
    is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department of Defense
    (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously demonstrating
    financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a
    combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components,
    PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries  performed by TRICARE private sector
    contractors. The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken
    by DoD Components with additional collection activities performed by the Defense
    Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.
