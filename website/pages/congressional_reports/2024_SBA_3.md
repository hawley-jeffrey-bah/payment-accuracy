    Answer: The SVOG program was created as a temporary relief program in response
      to the COVID-19 pandemic, with most disbursements occurring within the first
      year.  Following guidance from OMB and the limitations outlined in Appendix
      C, which is written for programs with multiple years of disbursements, the SBA
      is committed to continuing working with the OMB to perform an improper payment
      review for the total disbursements made under the SVOG program.  SBA has begun
      testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays to estimate
      the rate of improper payments.  Budget permitting, the SBA expects to have the
      improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY 2025.
