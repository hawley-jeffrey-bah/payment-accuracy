- Answer: AmeriCorps’ analysis determined payment recapture audits are not cost-effective
    in any program or activity that expends over $1 million annually. Therefore, no
    recoveries or distributions related to audit recoveries are applicable. AmeriCorps’
    processes include a significant amount of manual work required to identify and
    recapture overpayments. The agency does not recover the money necessary to establish
    a self-funded recovery audit program.
