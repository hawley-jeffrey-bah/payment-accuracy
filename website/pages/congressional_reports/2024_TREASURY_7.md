- Answer: 'Treasury was not in compliance with PIIA for FY 2023 due to Treasury not
    adequately concluding whether the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) and Pandemic
    Relief for Aviation Workers, also known as the Payroll Support Program (PSP),
    pandemic relief programs are likely to make IPs and UPs above or below the statutory
    threshold.


    The OIG recommendation was Treasury''s Risk and Control Group (RCG) should work
    with the Office of Capital Access (OCA) management to consider all information
    available when answering risk assessment questions to ensure adequate completion
    and conclusion of susceptibility for these program-specific risk assessments.


    The following are the actions and measurable milestones these programs have planned
    for this non-compliance criteria: OCA conducted a new risk assessment for FY24
    for ERA. The risk assessments reconsidered previous answers and took into account
    factors beyond the four corners of the assessment template. Additionally, OCA
    has completed additional risk assessment addendums on program recipient and sub-recipients
    as coordinated by RCG.  OCA did not conduct a new risk assessment for FY24 for
    PSP, given that the program has wound down and had less than $10 million in outlays
    during FY23. However, and as noted in a memo sent to ODCFO on 9/17/24, OCA will
    conduct a payment recapture audit of PSP. OIG audits of PSP recipients have pointed
    to the inclusion of unallowable employer-side payroll taxes and corporate officer
    compensation in recipients'' sworn financial statements as causes for overpayments.


    Treasury was also found non-compliant for not reporting an improper payment error
    rate of less than 10% for the IRS Earned Income Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax
    Credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and the refundable Premium Assistance
    Tax Credit. OIG did not provide any recommendations regarding this non-compliant
    criteria. Refundable tax credit overclaims are not the result of internal control
    weaknesses that the IRS can remediate internally, but are in fact the result of
    factors beyond the Agency''s control under the current law and existing authority.'

- Answer: "The Office of Capital Access's (OCA's) Chief Operating Officer (COO) and\
    \ the internal control program are responsible for oversight of improper payment\
    \ controls, while OCA directors, management, and supervisors are responsible for\
    \ identifying and implementing internal controls. This includes establishing a\
    \ control environment that prevents improper payments from being made, effectively\
    \ managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting and recovering improper\
    \ payments that may occur. The COO has performance expectations related to payment\
    \ integrity and financial stewardship incorporated into COO's annual performance\
    \ plan.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) continues significant\
    \ efforts to bring its payment program to an improper rate of less than 10 percent.\
    \ The IRS captures metrics related to pre-refund activities and works closely\
    \ with internal and external partners to expand outreach efforts. Many of these\
    \ metrics are tied to the pre-refund examination program and IRS's continued approach\
    \ to improve refundable tax credit audits. The Refund Integrity and Compliance\
    \ Services (RICS) Director conducts quarterly operational reviews with Refundable\
    \ Credits Examination Operations (RCEO) and Refundable Credits Program Management\
    \ (RCPM) on the refundable credits program. The RICS and RCPM Directors and managers\
    \ have performance plan commitments that address enhancements emphasizing tax\
    \ return accuracy and reducing improper payments. Proactive actions are being\
    \ taken to improve the audit response rates and taxpayer's filing behavior for\
    \ refundable credits to decrease the audit selection volume. The IRS performance\
    \ plans have a balanced approach which include outreach and compliance. Again,\
    \ the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve the\
    \ knowledge of taxpayers and paid return preparers on the eligibility and criteria\
    \ for RTCs. Without significant legislative action and restructuring of programs,\
    \ meeting a target compliance date will be a significant challenge."
