    Description_Action_Taken: The Department continues to work internally to address
      accounting errors that resulted in rounding errors made by the recipients of
      the funds. The small amounts identified relative to the program outlays would
      not usually present an opportunity to efficiently use resources to attempt to

    Accountability: 'Department personnel, including executive managers and staff,
      are held accountable for promoting payment

      integrity and maintaining effective internal controls in their day-to-day jobs.
      Key management officials have

      specific expectations related to payment integrity included in their annual
      performance plans. Program officials who administer programs deemed susceptible
      to significant improper payments are highly engaged in developing and implementing
      corrective actions as well as providing technical assistance for grantees to
      prevent improper payments for being made and to ensure payments are supported
      by sufficient documentation. Due to the improper payment and unknown payment
      estimate being below the statutory threshold, a reduction target is not required
      for this program.


      '
    Needs1: The program's reported improper and unknown payment estimate is below
      the statutory threshold; therefore, the program is not required to establish
      and publish a reduction target for the next Fiscal Year. With no reduction target
      established, the tolerable rate cannot be determined. While the tolerable rate
      for the Education Stabilization Fund program has not been identified, the program
      has the internal controls, human capital, information systems and other infrastructure
      to maintain low improper payments and unknown payments.
    Needs2: The Department did not request additional resources. This program has
      well designed and effective internal controls in place.
    Sufficiency: These were accounting errors that resulted in rounding errors made
      by the recipients of the funds. The small amounts identified relative to the
      program outlays would not usually present an opportunity to efficiently use
      resources to attempt to recover.

    Answer: The ESF program experienced overpayments that were beyond the agency’s
      control, due to automatic rounding errors. These discrepancies occurred both
      within Excel and other system-based processes. Preventing rounding within system-based
      processes is inherently challenging. When rounding occurs in a system and is
      subsequently recalculated in Excel, discrepancies can arise, resulting in minor
      differences in amounts. Consequently, it is difficult for states to prevent
      these rounding errors, which is why they are classified as beyond the agency’s
      control.

      Act and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act
      for Award Year (AY) 2024-2025 which streamlines and strengthens the collection
      of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Implementation
      of the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act improves data authentication by
      enabling FSA to automatically receive certain federal tax information (FTI)

      The FUTURE Act will significantly reduce the burden to borrowers who are submitting
      an income driven repayment (IDR) application or completed the recertification
      processes as the law allows FSA and entities providing loan servicing functions
      to review FTI, validate IDR monthly payment calculations, and trace why and
      when payment changes occurred. Implementation of the authorities provided in
      the FAFSA Simplification Act improved reporting through, for example, modifying
      the questions that students and their families have to answer on the FAFSA form
      and requiring ED to conduct early awareness and outreach of student aid eligibility.


      Institutions are required to remain compliant with changing requirements, such
      as those related to institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and
      administrative capability. FSA established an integrated system of complementary
      oversight functions to help detect and recover improper payments and ensure
      compliance by all participating parties. As part of its oversight activities,
      FSA performs program reviews of selected schools and monitors compliance audits
      to confirm requirements are met. For any deficiencies identified, FSA monitors
      corrective actions taken by schools.

      this authority. FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight
      functions to help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance

    Answer: A technically IP is a payment in the correct amount to the correct recipient,
      but for which some requirement was not met or step performed. As such, these
      technically IPs do not result in the need for the program to recover funds due
      to overpayment. These technically IPs are made by institutions receiving Pell
      Grant funding, often due to untimely disbursements of the aid to the student
      and/or return of unused funds to FSA, procedural deficiencies, or human error.
      These technically IPs are identified from compliance audit findings to include
      those related to untimely return of Title IV funds, untimely calculation of
      Title IV funds, incorrect disbursement timing, credit balance returned late,
      failure to properly complete verification, and professional judgement deficiencies.

    Answer: 'FSA leverages compliance audit data to estimate improper payments and
      unknown payments. In some instances, FSA is unable to discern whether the payments
      are proper or improper. This is mainly due to insufficient documentation from
      the auditors and/or schools. For example, there may be rare instances in which
      the auditor is unable to provide documentation to FSA because the information
      was not retained, or

      it was lost or stolen.


      Unknown payments were more likely to occur in compliance audits for fiscal years
      ending in 2019 and

      prior. In 2019, FSA worked with OMB and the audit community to update the OMB
      Compliance

      Supplement to require auditors to provide FSA with supplemental compliance audit
      information, which

      reduced the possibility of unknown payments in audits for fiscal years ending
      in 2020 and later.

      Act and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act
      for Award Year (AY) 2024-2025 which streamlines and strengthens the collection
      of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Implementation

      report their income and tax information for the total and permanent disability

      This has and will significantly reduce the burden to borrowers who are submitting
      an income driven repayment (IDR) application or completed the recertification
      processes as the law allows FSA and entities providing loan servicing functions
      to review FTI, validate IDR monthly payment calculations, and trace why and
      when payment changes occurred. Implementation of the authorities provided in
      the FAFSA Simplification Act improves reporting through, for example, modifying
      the questions that students and their families have to answer on the FAFSA form
      and requiring ED to conduct early awareness and outreach of student aid eligibility.


      Institutions are required to remain compliant with changing requirements, such

    Accountability: 'Key management officials have annual performance appraisal elements
      that contain specific criteria related to payment integrity.


      FSA managers and staff are held accountable for maintaining effective controls.
      FSA performs an annual assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls,
      including those controls designed to prevent or detect improper payments. Any
      deficiencies identified are remediated and retested within the next assessment
      cycle.


      FSA has an integrated system of complementary oversight functions to help prevent,
      detect, and recover improper payments, and ensure compliance by all participating
      parties. This includes routinely conducting program reviews to confirm that
      schools meet requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility,
      and administrative capability. Program reviews evaluate schools’ compliance
      with federal requirements, assess monetary liabilities for errors in performance
      which are calculated based on program review findings, and identify actions
      schools must take to make whole the Higher Education Act’s Title IV programs
      or recipients for any funds that were improperly managed and prevent the same
      problems from recurring. FSA also uses Single Audit Act compliance audits as
      a key source of identifying risks and potential improper payments made by schools.
      FSA has worked with fund recipients to resolve audit findings timely.

    Needs1: 'The Direct Loan program has achieved its tolerable rate. FSA has the
      internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other infrastructure

      FSA must also continue to rely on controls established by external entities
      that receive funds and make payments on behalf of FSA for programs including
      Direct Loans. These entities are outside of FSA’s operational control. FSA will
      continue to leverage data from program reviews and Single Audit Act compliance
      audits to identify and address root causes of IPs and UPs made by external entities.

      '
    Needs2: The most recent budget provides $2.7 billion for Student Aid Administration,
      including to the Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA),
      a $625 million increase over the fiscal year 2024 annualized continuing resolution
      (CR) level. This additional funding is essential to support students and student
      loan borrowers. The increase would allow FSA to continue to operate the student
      aid programs, implement critical improvements to student loan servicing, continue
      to modernize its digital infrastructure, and provide for the administration
      of the financial aid programs through a simplified and streamlined application
      process for students and borrowers.
    Sufficiency: "Preventing IPs is a top Administration and agency priority. To effectively\

    Answer: 'The Direct Loan program structure per the Higher Education Act of 1965
      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). Errors made
      by institutions such as for incorrect financial aid determination, credit balance
      deficiencies, student withdrawal deficiencies, and documentation deficiencies
      are outside of FSA''s control.


      The HEA does provide FSA authority to require the intermediary to impose certain
      internal controls or mitigation strategies to prevent these IPs, and FSA exercises
      this authority. FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight
      functions to help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance
      by all participating institutions.

    Answer: 'A technically IP is a payment in the correct amount to the correct recipient,
      but for which some requirement was not met or step performed. As such, these
      technically IPs do not result in the need for the program to recover funds due
      to overpayment. These technically IPs are made by institutions receiving Direct
      Loan funding, often due to untimely disbursements of the aid to the student
      and/or return of unused funds to FSA, procedural deficiencies, or human error.
      These technically IPs are identified from compliance audit findings to include
      those related to untimely return of Title IV funds, untimely calculation of
      Title IV funds, incorrect disbursement timing, credit balance returned late,
      failure to properly complete verification, and professional judgement deficiencies.

    Answer: 'FSA leverages compliance audit data to estimate improper payments and
      unknown payments. In some

      instances, FSA is unable to discern whether the payments are proper or improper.
      This is mainly due to

      insufficient documentation from the auditors and/or schools. For example, there
      may be rare instances in

      which the auditor is unable to provide documentation to FSA because the information
      was not retained, or

      it was lost or stolen.


      Unknown payments were more likely to occur in compliance audits for fiscal years
      ending in 2019 and

      prior. In 2019, FSA worked with OMB and the audit community to update the OMB
      Compliance

      Supplement to require auditors to provide FSA with supplemental compliance audit
      information, which

      reduced the possibility of unknown payments in audits for fiscal years ending
      in 2020 and later.

    Answer: 'FSA leverages compliance audit data to estimate improper payments and
      unknown payments. In some instances, there is a lack of or insufficient audit
      documentation when attempting to identify improper payments. This primarily
      occurs when the supplemental information provided to FSA in accordance with
      the OMB Compliance Supplement is unclear or inconsistent with the results of
      the compliance audit and final audit determination (FAD) letter. If this occurs,
      FSA must follow-up with auditors. In instances that auditors did not retain
      the documentation, or if the auditor is unable to provide FSA the supplemental
      information timely, FSA records unknown payments in accordance with OMB Circular
      A-123, Appendix C.
