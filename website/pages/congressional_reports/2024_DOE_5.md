SurveyData:
- Answer: "In FY 2024, the Department reported 2023 payment outlays amount of $62.19B,\
    \ of which $39.63M was determined to be improper resulting in improper payment\
    \ rate of 0.06%. The Department recaptured $29.88M of the $32.33M of the improper\
    \ payments identified for recapture, resulting in a recapture rate of 92.40%.\
    \ Due to the Department's low improper payment rate, and high recapture rate,\
    \ the determination was made that it is not cost-effective to conduct recovery\
    \ audits. \n\nDOE conducts recovery activities including but not limited to prepayment\
    \ review and approval of invoices; performing quarterly prompt-payment reviews,\
    \ post-payment reviews, and contractor internal audits; leveraging the results\
    \ of cost allowability audits of integrated contractors and interim and close-out\
    \ reviews of contracts and grants, reviews of grant credits in the Automated Standard\
    \ Application for Payments (ASAP), and results from travel audits."
