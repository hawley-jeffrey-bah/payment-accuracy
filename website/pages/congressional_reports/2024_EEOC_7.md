- Answer: 'It was recommended that EEOC implement agency-wide Improper Payment Risk
    Assessment Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) based on OMB A-123 Appendix C guidance
    and identify a responsible point of contact for each significant program. The
    responsible party should report results of their risk assessment to the EEOC responsible
    official.   It was also recommended to implement an SOP to ensure annual compliance
    with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements.   The agency developed
    and implemented an agency-wide PIIA policy on December 28, 2023, to address compliance
    with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements and risk assessment procedures.  The
    agency has also conducted an Improper Payment risk assessment of the Pay and Benefits
    (Payroll) Program and concluded that the Pay and Benefits (Payroll) Program is
    not susceptible to significant improper payments or unknown payments.  The agency
    will also report the results of the Pay and Benefits risk assessment in the agency''s
    financial report.

- Answer: 'In a performance agreement for the official, incentives and consequences
    are meant to be aligned with the official''s efforts to enhance payment accuracy,
    prevent fraud, and bring the agency into compliance. Incentives may include financial
    rewards, recognition, and access to additional training and development opportunities
    to enhance skills and expertise. Conversely, consequences may include being held
    accountable for any significant lapses in payment integrity due to gross negligence,
    reputational impact which might affect their future career prospects, and legal
    consequences for the agency. Effective performance agreements create a strong
    incentive for the official(s) to diligently work toward improving payment accuracy
    and preventing fraud, as their professional advancement and reputation, as well
    as the reputation of the agency, are directly affected by their ability to meet
    these goals.
