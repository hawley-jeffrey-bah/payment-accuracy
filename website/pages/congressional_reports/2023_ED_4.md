    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: ED
    Answer: 'The overpayments encountered are outside of agency control due to the
      fact that the direct recipients of funds (State Education Agency''s or SEAs)
      acted as a pass-through entity to their sub-grantees, who were the ultimate
      recipients. As such, the Department processed the relevant payments to the SEA
      based on their internal controls and payment review process. Furthermore, these
      overpayments were due to rounding errors in most instances. Additionally, in
      certain cases where the Department did make the direct payment to the end user,
      the documentation submitted was seemingly sufficient except for minor rounding

      errors. The small amounts involved would not usually justify expending additional
      resources or time to have Department staff reperform the calculations.'

    Answer: The program's reported improper and unknown payment estimate is below

      and publish a reduction target for the next Fiscal Year. With no reduction target
      established, the tolerable rate cannot be determined. While the tolerable rate

    Answer: FSA has determined that some but not all Pell Grant overpayments are within
      agency control. Pell Grant overpayments related to misreported income, which
      is measured using the Pell FAFSA/IRS Statistical Study are within FSA’s control.
      FSA is working to implement the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain
      federal tax information data directly from the IRS. Obtaining this data will
      prevent improper payments resulting from the applicant misreporting their income
      on the FAFSA. Pell Grant overpayments due to other reasons are outside of FSA's
      control.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: ED
    Answer: 'The Pell Grant program structure per the Higher Education Act of 1965
      (HEA) requires that funds pass through an intermediary non-federal entity (i.e.,
      participating institutes of higher education) before reaching the ultimate beneficiary
      (i.e., the student). FSA cannot control improper payments made by institutions
      receiving FSA funding, because FSA does not control the payment process (i.e.,
      the distribution of the funds between the institution and student). Errors made
      by institutions for incorrect financial aid determination, credit balance deficiencies,
      student withdrawal deficiencies, and documentation deficiencies are outside
      of FSA''s control.


      The HEA does provide FSA authority to require the intermediary to impose certain
      internal controls or mitigation strategies to prevent these IPs, and FSA exercises
      this authority. FSA has established an integrated system of complementary oversight
      functions to help prevent, detect, and recover IPs and UPs, and ensure compliance
      by all participating institutions.'

    Answer: A technically IP is a payment in the correct amount to the correct recipient,
      but for which some requirement was not met or step performed. As such, these
      technically IP do not result in the need for the program to recover funds due
      to overpayment. These technically IP are made by institutions receiving Pell
      Grant funding, often due to untimely disbursements of the aid to the student
      and/or return of unused funds to FSA, procedural deficiencies, or human error.
      These technically IPs are identified from compliance audit findings to include
      those related to untimely return of Title IV funds, untimely calculation of
      Title IV funds, incorrect disbursement timing, credit balance returned late,
      failure to properly complete verification, and professional judgement deficiencies.

    Answer: 'FSA leverages compliance audit data to estimate improper payments and
      unknown payments. In some instances, FSA is unable to discern whether the payments
      are proper or improper. This is mainly due to insufficient documentation from
      the auditors and/or schools. For example, there may be rare instances in

      which the auditor is unable to provide documentation to FSA because the information
      was not retained, or it was lost or stolen.


      Unknown payments were more likely to occur in compliance audits for fiscal years
      ending in 2019 and prior. In 2019, FSA worked with OMB and the audit community
      to update the OMB Compliance Supplement to require auditors to provide FSA with
      supplemental compliance audit information, which reduced the possibility of
      unknown payments in audits for fiscal years ending in 2020 and later.'
