- Answer: "On September 15, 2011, the SBA submitted a Payment Recapture Audit Cost-Effective\
    \ Analysis to the Office of Management and Budget. The analysis discussed the\
    \ 7(a) Business Loan Guaranty Program, the 504 Certified Development Company Loan\
    \ Guaranty Program, the Disaster Direct Loan Program, Disbursements for Goods\
    \ and Services, the Small Business Investment Company Financing Guaranty Program,\
    \ the Surety Bond Guaranty Program, and Grants, which included all grant programs.\
    \ The analysis described the program, the controls over financial disbursements,\
    \ and the size of the program and concluded for each program that recapture audits\
    \ would not be cost effective due to low error rates, complexity of the program,\
    \ or limited amount of outlays. A subsequent cost analysis for the 7(a) loan guaranty\
    \ purchase program was submitted to OMB on September 13, 2017, to include the\
    \ results of a payment recapture audit performed in 2015, which again concluded\
    \ that such an audit is not cost effective. In FY 2022, the SBA performed a cost-benefit\
    \ analysis for programs with over $1 million in disbursements and not covered\
    \ by the analysis completed in 2011, and concluded that it would not be cost-effective\
    \ to perform a recovery audit. Some of the factors considered include the following:\
    \ program was not identified as being susceptible to significant improper payments\
    \ in the last risk assessment, there have been no recent audit findings or reports\
    \ to suggest that the program is susceptible to improper payments, prior internal\
    \ control assessments did not identify the program as being susceptible to significant\
    \ improper payments, and the cost to perform a recovery audit exceeded the potential\
    \ recovery amount. \n\nIn FY 2023, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits.\
    \ As mentioned above, in prior years, the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses\
    \ on programs subject to payment recapture audit, and deemed the costs to perform\
    \ a payment recapture audit outweighed the benefits of the audit. \n\nIn lieu\
    \ of recovery audits, for programs currently reporting improper payment estimates,\
    \ the improper payment review testing and results from the testing were leveraged\
    \ to identify potential payments that could be recovered.  In addition to that,\
    \ there are also other reviews (internal control assessments, post-award reviews,\
    \ monthly QA reviews, cost compliance reviews, etc.) conducted on those programs\
    \ that are outside of the recovery audit process that were also leveraged to identify\
    \ improper payments.  \n\nAlthough recovery audits are not performed, the SBA\
    \ does conduct recovery activities for improper payments identified outside of\
    \ the recovery audit process.   For example, on 7(a) loan guaranty approvals,\
    \ overpayments identified in the improper payments review are recaptured from\
    \ the lender, on disaster direct loans and COVID-EIDL loans, overpayments identified\
    \ are recovered through loan modifications, on EIDL advances, overpayments can\
    \ be recovered via fund offsets or referral to OIG, for PPP loans, overpayments\
    \ can be recovered through loan modifications and repayment, for RRF awards, overpayments\
    \ are recovered via demand letters sent to awardees, and for SVOG, overpayments\
    \ are recovered through demand letters, and Treasury debt cross-servicing."
