- Answer: 'The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified
    in recovery audits across various programs:


    Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments
    by issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the
    identified amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from
    future payments made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily
    submit a refund to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper
    payment.


    Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations,
    the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation
    audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy
    of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS
    anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment
    Data Validation audits in FY 2024.


    Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an
    analysis of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare
    Part D coverage. Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors
    are notified of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation
    is provided.


    Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of
    Medicaid overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.


    Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments
    related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues
    a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt''s existence and including claim-specific
    information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt
    and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified
    timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if
    the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury
    for collection.


    These methods demonstrate a systematic approach to recovering improper payments
    in various healthcare programs, ensuring that funds are appropriately recovered
    while providing avenues for resolution and reconciliation where necessary.'
