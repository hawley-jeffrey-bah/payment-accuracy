    Answer: HHS plans to provide ongoing training to recipients on the issues that
      caused payment errors in the Head Start program.  Training will be conducted
      in areas such as procurement, source documentation, cost allocation, allowability
      of cost and other common fiscal challenges that lead to payment errors.  HHS
      also plans to issue Information Memorandum and Program Instructions as needed
      to ensure fiscal and program integrity.    In addition, targeted technical assistance
      will be provided to individual recipients to address their specific error causes.  Further,
      HHS plans to take recovery action on payment errors identified during improper
      payment reviews and continue to issue disallowances on errors discovered through
      HHS Office of Inspector General audits, HHS program reviews, and Single Audits.

    Answer: HHS’s corrective actions include identifying and remediating system defects
      within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments.  These defects become known
      through various mechanisms, including internal quality control activities and
      external reviews of APTC eligibility determinations made by the Exchanges. HHS
      continually evaluates the policies and procedures that underlie the automated
      processes associated with APTC to identify and address weaknesses that may surface
      as they become operationalized.  HHS also proactively improves its automated
      processes, e.g., the Verify Lawful Presence service with the Department of Homeland
      Security was upgraded to ensure more accurate and timely lawful presence verifications.
      HHS implemented process automation to reduce human error introduced during adjudication
      and processing of supporting documentation.  HHS will continue to encourage
      and require that additional tasks be automated to further reduce manual errors
      and improve the accuracy and quality of required adjudication tasks. HHS plans
      to continue these actions in FY 2024, but will not finalize this decision until
      the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: As part of Eligibility Support Contractor Education, personnel undergo
      thorough onboarding training, annual refreshers, and quick lessons for policy
      or operations updates. Ad- hoc training is provided as needed. HHS conducts
      extra training sessions for Data Matching Issues verifications, casework, and
      outreach. HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2024, but will not finalize
      this decision until the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: Both the automated and the manual processes of the Exchanges are subject
      to rigorous annual testing of key internal controls as required by Appendix
      C of OMB Circular A-123.  External audits by OIG and GAO are another common
      mechanism that help to identify potential payment integrity risks within the
      Exchanges, specifically by evaluating APTC eligibility determinations made by
      the Exchanges within the context of federal statute and regulations. HHS plans
      to continue these actions in FY 2024, but will not finalize this decision until
      the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: The Marketplace Program Integrity Contractor implemented a risk model
      that incorporates many risk factors that may indicate potential fraud or misconduct
      by agents or brokers.  The result is a risk profile and weighted risk score
      for each agent or broker.  Those that pose the highest risk, based on weighted
      risk score, are prioritized for investigations.  The risk profile is also leveraged
      as part of a prioritized investigation and significant discoveries may be used
      to inform interview questions or as supporting evidence in overall case findings.
      In FY23, there are 23 indicators in the A/B risk model. HHS plans to continue
      these actions in FY 2024, but will not finalize this decision until the APTC
      Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: 'Under the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) Program, states
      design and conduct pilots to evaluate the processes that determine an individual’s
      eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP benefits.  The MEQC program also reviews eligibility
      determinations that are not reviewed under Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM),
      such as denials and terminations.  States have flexibility in designing pilots
      to focus on vulnerable or error-prone areas identified. HHS will also continue
      conducting audits of beneficiary eligibility determinations in high-risk states
      based on a risk assessment that reviewed states with higher eligibility improper
      payment rates, eligibility errors based on GAO or OIG reports, issues identified
      by states through the MEQC program, and issues identified through HHS’s various
      corrective action plan oversight processes. Unified Program Integrity Coordinators
      (UPICs) will also  perform numerous functions to detect and prevent fraud, and
      identify broader vulnerabilities to the integrity of Medicaid.

SurveyData:
- Answer: 'The agency employs several methods to recover improper payments identified
    in recovery audits across various programs:


    Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Recovery Audits: CMS recovers improper payments
    by issuing demand letters to providers. These letters request repayment of the
    identified amounts owed. The agency has the option to offset the owed amount from
    future payments made to the provider. Alternatively, the provider can voluntarily
    submit a refund to the Medicare Administrative Contractor to rectify the improper
    payment.


    Medicare Part C: To recover Part C overpayments in Medicare Advantage Organizations,
    the primary strategy is to conduct Contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation
    audits. These audits involve reviewing medical records to confirm the accuracy
    of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations for risk-adjusted payments.  CMS
    anticipates initiating overpayment recovery actions for Contract-level Risk Adjustment
    Data Validation audits in FY 2024.


    Medicare Part D: The agency identifies improper payments in Part D through an
    analysis of Prescription Drug Event Records that were not eligible for Medicare
    Part D coverage. Audits focus on high-risk and high-cost drugs, and Part D sponsors
    are notified of improper payments that need to be recouped unless supporting documentation
    is provided.


    Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors: State-run programs handle the recovery of
    Medicaid overpayments, and CMS does not have operational control over their efforts.


    Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Audit Contractor: For identifying improper payments
    related to Medicare as the secondary payer, the Recovery Audit Contractor issues
    a demand letter, notifying debtors of the debt''s existence and including claim-specific
    information. Debtors are given instructions on how to repay or dispute the debt
    and are informed of the consequences of failing to resolve it within the specified
    timeframe. Interest is assessed on any unresolved balance after 60 days, and if
    the debt remains unresolved, it may be referred to the Department of the Treasury
    for collection.


    These methods demonstrate a systematic approach to recovering improper payments
    in various healthcare programs, ensuring that funds are appropriately recovered
    while providing avenues for resolution and reconciliation where necessary.'
