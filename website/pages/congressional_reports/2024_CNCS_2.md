    Answer: AmeriCorps had previously established a Payment Integrity Corrective Action
      Plan working group. This group will be revived in FY 2025 analyzing the latest
      payment integrity results and determining the best actions to reduce rates.
      Additionally, AmeriCorps has developed an internal control for grantees trainings
      that will be required in the FY 2025 terms and conditions. AmeriCorps will develop
      specific required remediations for grantees with identical year over year findings.

    Answer: The agency currently has two vendors that provide different required National
      Service Criminal History Checks. The agency will move to one contracted vendor
      that can provide compliant National Service Criminal History Checks. This will
      be a new, streamlined process for grantees.
