    \ Agency (FSA) Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters, (3) Livestock Forage\
    \ Disaster Program, and (4) Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program were found\
    \ to be non-compliant with criteria 6 which requires reporting an improper payment\
    \ estimate of less than 10 percent. \n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG)\
    \ recommended that SNAP provide information on paymentaccuracy.gov about actions\
    \ it will take to come into compliance with the Payment Integrity Information\
    \ Act (PIIA) requirement. Specifically, the OIG recommended that SNAP establish\
    \ measurable milestones to comply with PIIA requirements to report an improper\
    \ payment rate of 10 percent or less. To that end, the Food and Nutrition Service\
    \ (FNS) has identified the SNAP improper payment rate target as 11 percent for\
    \ Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 performance, 10.5 percent for FY 2025 performance, and\
    \ 10 percent for FY 2026 performance. To achieve these targets, FNS will continue\
    \ to conduct training for State agencies on an ongoing basis and will provide\
    \ additional tools to conduct root cause analysis and identify trends in error\
    \ rate data. In FY 2025, FNS will facilitate two meetings focused on assisting\
    \ States in determining their root causes of error and corrective actions to address\
    \ them. In FY 2026, FNS will launch a new, modernized payment accuracy data management\
    \ system, which will include enhanced data analytics features to assist State\
    \ agencies in better utilizing their data for root cause analysis and corrective\
    \ action planning.\n\nDuring FY 2025, FSA  FSA submitted a plan to Congress, describing\
    \ detailed actions the agency will take to bring the program into compliance.\
    \  Planned Actions include:\n\n(1) Consolidating the program district director\
    \ review process into the FSA Internal Review Document and Tracking System to\
    \ ensure reviews are being completed timely and results are monitored and evaluated\
    \ to ensure ECP-Disaster policies are being followed.  \n\n(2) Establish additional\
    \ webinar/virtual training sessions as needed to ensure state office staff are\
    \ aware of updated policy requirements and clarifications on the requirements.\
    \  \n\n(3) Implement a new software platform, new methods for computing payments\
    \ using payment scenarios, and improve checklists for conducting internal reviews\
    \ throughout the application, approval and payment process\n\n"
