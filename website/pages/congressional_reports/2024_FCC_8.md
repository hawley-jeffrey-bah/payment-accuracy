- Answer: "The FCC had two program that were not compliant for the most recent reporting\
    \ period.  Those programs were the USF-Lifeline program which is in phase 2 since\
    \ it does not meet the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million in outlays.\
    \  The other program that was not in compliance in the Affordable Connectivity\
    \ program (ACP) which is currently in phase 1 reporting requirements.  \nUSF-Lifeline\
    \ - The Commission did not concur with the non-compliance finding for the Lifeline\
    \ program. The auditors’ recognized that no further action is required going forward.\
    \ However, we respectfully disagreed with the reasoning and conclusions that were\
    \ reached. The auditors based their finding on dated inputs (namely, an initial\
    \ response that gave a preliminary estimate done by our Administrator of what\
    \ might be a “potential” overpayment). In addition, the auditors appeared to consistently\
    \ disregarded subsequent written responses by the agency itself indicating that\
    \ the Commission had determined that the “potential” overpayment estimate the\
    \ auditors were relying on was vastly overstated. The consequence of the auditor’s\
    \ approach was to require the agency to report a substantial amount as improper\
    \ which the agency had repeatedly determined (as a regulatory matter) was not\
    \ in fact improper, undermining the accuracy of improper payment reporting.\n\
    As the FCC previously explained at length, this matter involved an unusual regulatory\
    \ wrinkle. The Commission had been considering a pending request from an eligible\
    \ telecommunications carrier (ETC) for a correction to the appendix to the June\
    \ 13, 2012 order granting it an ETC designation. The consideration of that request\
    \ was an exercise of the Commission’s regulatory authority, and a decision on\
    \ the application had to be made before a determination was made regarding whether\
    \ any payments were improper. The basic substance of that decision was made in\
    \ 2020—namely that the particular circumstances justified a nunc pro tunc grant\
    \ of authorization that would substantially reduce or eliminate any overpayment—and\
    \ was communicated to the auditors. Ultimately, on May 7, 2024, the agency issued\
    \ an order granting the request nunc pro tunc to June 13, 2012, the date of the\
    \ original grant. The effect of the order corrected the clerical filing error\
    \ made by the ETC and was retroactive to the date the original order and was issued.\
    \ Moreover, because the order was effective to the date of the original June 2012\
    \ order, the ETC provision of service in the relevant areas has giving rise to\
    \ the audit finding was authorized. Thus there were no improper payments and there\
    \ was never a need to report such. Per the auditors, on May 7, 2024, the FCC issued\
    \ two Orders and a related Consent Decree regarding this matter. The Orders and\
    \ Consent Decree had the effect of retroactively expanding the ETC’s jurisdiction\
    \ to the full area for which they had been operating. Therefore, the Orders had\
    \ the effect of retroactively making the balance of payments valid.\nACP - The\
    \ FCC underreported improper payment amounts of $6 million in its FY23 data that\
    \ was published on paymentaccuracy.gov. The recommendation by the auditors was\
    \ to develop and implement policies and procedures to identify, quantify, and\
    \ report any downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from\
    \ provider non-compliant conduct on paymentaccuracy.gov. Corrective actions will\
    \ include: 1) Every month, our Administrator will compile and report to the Office\
    \ of the Managing Director all ACP and EBB downward revisions received the prior\
    \ month that fall outside of the administrative filing window and 2) Develop an\
    \ ACP procedure to identify and report downward revisions that are submitted by\
    \ providers resulting from non-compliant conduct.\n"
