- Answer: "In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program\
    \ was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements (3, 4,\
    \ 5b and 6).    \n\nThe OIG determination was based upon the FEHB Program not\
    \ reporting an Improper Payment Estimate in FY 2023. The OIG recommended OPM issue\
    \ an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefit program\
    \ that will allow OPM to be in compliance with PIIA reporting requirements in\
    \ future reporting years. \n\nOPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed\
    \ for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management\
    \ and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB\
    \ Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to\
    \ significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in\
    \ FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.\
    \  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program\
    \ should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The\
    \ FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment\
    \ types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting\
    \ meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans. Off-cycle\
    \ risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB\
    \ Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.\
    \  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible\
    \ to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper\
    \ and unknown payment estimate.\n\nOPM developed a new improper payment methodology\
    \ in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to\
    \ meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15\
    \ Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This\
    \ Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide,\
    \ which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB\
    \ Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment\
    \ reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and\
    \ Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants.\
    \ OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the\
    \ FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their\
    \ data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025."

- Answer: OPM officials continue to collaborate on efforts and resources required
    to bring the agency into compliance with PIIA. OPM plans to develop goals for
    program offices and appropriate staff to help ensure OPM reports improper payment
    estimates for all required programs in FY 2025.  The accountable officials will
    also review and approve the improper payment estimates prior to submission to
    OMB.
