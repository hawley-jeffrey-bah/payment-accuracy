    Answer: Since the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is administered
      by State agencies, who also determine the structure of SNAP amongst numerous
      policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects, corrective actions must
      originate in and be tailored to each individual State agency's circumstances
      and particular root causes of payment error. As such, FNS is primarily focused
      on providing training and equipping State agencies with the knowledge and tools
      needed to individually develop meaningful root cause analysis and corrective
      action plans, including through the issuance of policy guidance. Additional
      tools planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 include new dashboards for State use
      in conducting root cause analysis and a new payment accuracy data entry and
      analysis system for State and Federal users. FNS has also contracted support
      to update the Keys to Payment Accuracy, a guidance document for State SNAP administering
      agencies on key strategies for improving payment accuracy.

    Answer: A majority of the improper payments related to the inability to access
      data/information were the result of policyholders over-reporting insurable acres
      on rainfall index plans of insurance.  RMA will issue an Informational Memorandum
      reminding external stakeholders of procedural requirements related to acreage
      reporting and reiterate the importance of applying these procedures accurately
      to prevent improper payments.

    Answer: One type of error leading to improper payments for failure to access data/information
      resulted from policies established under a unit structure that did not meet
      the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria that must be
      met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When these
      qualifications are not met the result is an improper payment. To further assess
      improper payments associated with unit structure, RMA will conduct a program
      review in order to determine if Approved Insurance Providers are appropriately
      applying unit structure requirements.

- Answer: "Overall, programs typically utilize the same recovery techniques when recovering\
    \ improper payments as those utilized with standard receivables.  \nFarm Service\
    \ Agency and Commodity Credit Corporation programs establish an audit receivable\
    \ that is eligible for offset from any future payments. At 120 days delinquent,\
    \ the receivable is referred to the Department of Treasury for collection, as\
    \ required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1986 and the 2022 Financial\
    \ Data Transparency Act. \nSimilarly, the Forest Service, Rural Development, and\
    \ Risk Management Agency  issue receivables when improper payments are discovered.\
    \ Consistent electronic follow-ups are performed to ensure timely recovery of\
    \ improper payments. \n"
