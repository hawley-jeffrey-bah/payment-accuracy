- Answer: "Overall, programs typically utilize the same recovery techniques when recovering\
    \ improper payments as those utilized with standard receivables.  \nFarm Service\
    \ Agency and Commodity Credit Corporation programs establish an audit receivable\
    \ that is eligible for offset from any future payments. At 120 days delinquent,\
    \ the receivable is referred to the Department of Treasury for collection, as\
    \ required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1986 and the 2022 Financial\
    \ Data Transparency Act. \nSimilarly, the Forest Service, Rural Development, and\
    \ Risk Management Agency  issue receivables when improper payments are discovered.\
    \ Consistent electronic follow-ups are performed to ensure timely recovery of\
    \ improper payments. \n"
