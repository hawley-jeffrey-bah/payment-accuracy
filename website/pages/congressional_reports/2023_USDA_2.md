    Answer: The root cause of improper payments was failure to access data/information.
      Values entered in the system were not correct based on the producerâ€™s certification,
      or County Committee adjustment.  The Farm Service Agency will conduct Coronavirus
      Food Assistance Program II spot checks to ensure manual entries are correctly
      entered in the application software. A full analysis of the results of Coronavirus
      Food Assistance Program II spot checks will be available. In addition to the
      spot checks that will be conducted, the Farm Service Agency will prioritize
      the use of existing data to pre-fill and pre-populate data fields on current
      and future ad hoc programs.  The agency will include and emphasize policy requirements,
      including adding validations to ensure manual entries match automated entries
      on all future and existing ad hoc programs. Additional review of the program
      will reflect the accuracy of program implementation.  This should mitigate the
      risk and decrease the number of erroneous occurrences in future similar programs.

    Answer: Farm Service Agency has introduced many new ad hoc programs post Coronavirus
      Disease of 2019.  There are multiple acreage reporting deadlines throughout
      the year depending on the crop.  Due to the many acreage reporting deadlines
      in county offices, additional emphasis on accountability is necessary and will
      be communicated to state offices through acreage reporting training tentatively
      scheduled for fiscal year 2024.

    Answer: The root cause of improper payments was failure to access data/information.
      Errors resulted from the payment calculations using old calculation methods.
      The eligible cost of practice or component were calculated incorrectly.  Farm
      Service Agency has developed new program payment scenarios which eliminates
      the county office requirement to compute cost share items considered eligible.
      The agency has provided policy on the use of the new payment scenarios and will
      continue to provide training and assistance in the transition of these new methods.  It
      is the goal of the agency to prevent ineligible costs and ensure the correct
      reimbursement rates are used.

    Answer: 'The root cause of improper payments was failure to access data/information.  Improper
      payment findings were related to the FSA-23 not being on file before the cost
      share agreement was approved.  The requirement to have an FSA-23 on file before
      the cost share agreement is approved is included on the CCC-770 Checklist.  The
      agency will revise the CCC-770 checklist to capture the District Director reviews
      during approval, payment, and lifespan of the practice. This will allow the
      District Directors to ensure and verify that the FSA-23 approval is completed
      before the cost share agreement is approved.  The checklist covers each step
      of the program process, including requesting cost share, approval, and payment.  The
      District Director is required to review and sign at each item on the checklist
      to ensure accuracy.


      The change process corrective actions planned are to ensure reviews are being
      completed timely and results are monitored and evaluated to ensure program policies
      are being followed.  The agency will also incorporate the program into the Internal
      Review Document Tracking System to track actions.

    Answer: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has implemented several opportunities
      of training for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
      and Children (WIC). Annual training is provided on FNSâ€™ National Management
      Evaluation (ME) guidance to regional office staff who conduct MEs. The goal
      of this training to establish standards for FNS to effectively communicate findings
      and corrective action expectations to State agencies, to provide necessary technical
      assistance, and to support State agency program improvements. Additional WIC
      specific ME training is conducted throughout the year to support regional staff
      by holding bi-monthly meetings to discuss best practices and provide technical
      assistance, as well as specific technical assistance as needed to improve understanding
      and compliance of ME activities. Additional training is provided to state agencies
      through specific technical assistance during oversight activities. Training
      activities for State agency staff are further identified through the results
      of an annual target area report. This report looks at national trends of program
      integrity issues as well as programmatic deficiencies across all State agencies
      to issue technical assistance, policy memos, and training as needed. FNS has
      also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target
      improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources
      include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit
      on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool
      for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality.

    Answer: A prime example of Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) implementing corrective
      actions are through WIC oversight. FNS uses management evaluations (MEs) as
      its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing WIC State
      agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of
      WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance to State Agencies
      and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024, FNS' ME target
      area for WIC is Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition services
      is essential to carrying out the Program's mission. The Nutrition Services ME
      examines how State agencies plan for and deliver nutrition services, including
      nutrition and breastfeeding education. In addition to the ME target area, FNS
      also conducts a national risk-based ME assessment to identify State agencies
      with known program integrity issues. Program integrity issues include issues
      relating to improper payments, vendor management, certification/eligibility,
      fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary values risk to the Program.
      The FY 2020-2024 Target Area also include a focus on updating existing ME materials
      and technology. The target area supports the United States Department of Agriculture
      (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer service
      to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC Program
      through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS continues
      to analyze ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
      and integrity. This includes addressing certification and vendor issues that
      could result in improper payments.

    Answer: Since the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is administered
      by State agencies, who also determine the structure of SNAP amongst numerous
      policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects, corrective actions must
      originate in and be tailored to each individual State agency's circumstances
      and particular root causes of payment error. As such, FNS is primarily focused
      on providing training and equipping State agencies with the knowledge and tools
      needed to individually develop meaningful root cause analysis and corrective
      action plans, including through the issuance of policy guidance. Additional
      tools planned for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 include new dashboards for State use
      in conducting root cause analysis and a new payment accuracy data entry and
      analysis system for State and Federal users. FNS has also contracted support
      to update the Keys to Payment Accuracy, a guidance document for State SNAP administering
      agencies on key strategies for improving payment accuracy.

    Answer: A majority of the improper payments related to the inability to access
      data/information were the result of policyholders over-reporting insurable acres
      on rainfall index plans of insurance.  RMA will issue an Informational Memorandum

    Answer: One type of error leading to improper payments for failure to access data/information
      resulted from policies established under a unit structure that did not meet
      the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria that must be
      met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When these
      qualifications are not met the result is an improper payment. To further assess
      improper payments associated with unit structure, RMA will conduct a program
      review in order to determine if Approved Insurance Providers are appropriately
      applying unit structure requirements.
