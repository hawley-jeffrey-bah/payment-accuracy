SurveyData:
- Answer: OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C provides guidance for agencies to determine
    if cost-effective payment recapture audits can be performed. The Department had
    been performing, from 2005 through June 2017, primarily with contractor assistance,
    annual payment recapture audits of contracts/obligations for many of the Department’s
    bureaus/ reporting entities on a rotational basis. Annual payment recapture auditing
    was additionally performed by a contractor, effective 2011, for Department-wide
    grants and other cooperative agreements (i.e., financial assistance). In March
    2018, the Department completed a cost/benefit analysis for contracts/obligations
    and for grants and other cooperative agreements and determined that it was not
    able to conduct a cost-effective payment recapture audit program (one in which
    the benefits, including recaptured amounts, exceed the costs) for the above noted
    categories. The Department continues to periodically evaluate if there are any
    categories of disbursements for which payment recapture auditing could be or could
    become cost-effective.
