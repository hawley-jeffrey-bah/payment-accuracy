    Description_Action_Taken: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is strengthening
      the insurance verification process to assist in the review for a potential duplication
      of benefits. Through Funeral Assistance program reviews, there were noted instances
      applicant submitted limited insurance documents from life insurance companies,
      but it was not clear if the decedent actually had funeral and/or burial insurance
      coverage within the policy. As such, the program has made updates to the current
      operating procedures to strengthen the insurance verification process. FEMA
      will consider insurance specifically intended only for funeral and burial costs
      a duplication of benefits and will not consider more general insurance for which
      proceeds may be used towards funeral costs. This will continue to be program’s
      approach and it will be further clarified in the next version of the Individual
      Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG). In addition, FEMA is also enhancing
      the change management process as it relates to critical changes made throughout
      the assistance period to ensure that all relevant personnel and staff are aware
      of changes to the operating procedures and program requirements.

    Description_Action_Taken: Due to the expanded nature of COVID-19 Funeral assistance,
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implemented additional reports
      to monitor and mitigate the potential for Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown
      Payments (UPs). These daily reports identify data anomalies, to include (1)
      funeral assistance applications containing three or more decedents; (2) applications
      without decedent information; (3) applications transferred to another disaster;
      and (4) applications canceled as exact duplicates. Identification of these data
      elements were used to provide reminders and supplemental refresher trainings.
      Additionally, FEMA Recovery established a new section in the Reporting and Analytics
      Division in October 2022, solely dedicated to payment integrity, including case
      reviews, application of fraud prevention tools and controls, and coordination
      of guidance and procedure changes with the Individual Assistance (IA) program.

    Description_Action_Taken: "The National Emergency Management Information System\
      \ (NEMIS) is the information technology system that houses the survivor case\
      \ files and is the master database that the Federal Emergency Management Agency\
      \ (FEMA) uses to administer its assistance programs and make disaster assistance\
      \ decisions. NEMIS supports assistance programs across the Individuals and Households\
      \ Program (IHP) spectrum, which is divided into Housing Assistance and Other\
      \ Needs Assistance (ONA). Because Funeral Assistance is a part of ONA, FEMA\
      \ uses NEMIS to support funeral assistance processing. \n\nThe system is primarily\
      \ designed to support disaster relief to individuals and households whose property\
      \ has been damaged or destroyed rather than the loss of life associated with\
      \ funeral assistance. However, FEMA conducted a robust review of existing NEMIS\
      \ business rules including automated system controls for verifying information\
      \ such as addresses, and identity were conducted. This review was necessary\
      \ due to the anticipated intervention required to support a disaster declaration\
      \ limited to only COVID-19 Funeral Assistance instead of the full range of assistance\
      \ offered under a traditional IHP declaration. \n\nFEMA’s processing system,\
      \ NEMIS, performs automated checks on certain data elements within a funeral\
      \ assistance application to identify potential duplications. FEMA checks for\
      \ duplications in data fields such as applicant or co-applicant social security\
      \ number; damaged dwelling address (DDA); and deceased individual’s name, and\
      \ social security number. FEMA routes all these sources of potential duplication,\
      \ when identified, to the Duplicate Investigation queue for manual review. Applications\
      \ in the Duplicate Investigation queue require manual clearance of any potential\
      \ duplications before they may continue being processed. For most Individual\
      \ Assistance programs processed through NEMIS, the DDA field pertains to the\
      \ address where real or personal property damage occurred. In the case of COVID-19\
      \ Funeral Assistance, FEMA uses the DDA data field to document the location\
      \ where the COVID-19 death occurred. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many deaths\
      \ occurred at shared locations such as hospitals and medical facilities. As\
      \ such, the DDA data field is a common source of potential duplications identified\
      \ by the NEMIS system. All financial related errors are attributed to the required\
      \ human intervention for manually processingCOVID-19 funeral assistance, to\
      \ include manually reviewing NEMIS flags."

    Description_Action_Taken: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual
      Assistance (IA) Division provided refresher training in March 2023 to staff
      processing requests for COVID-19 Funeral Assistance. Going forward, FEMA will
      continue to coordinate with the Program Management Section (PMS) to send reminders
      to the staff processing funeral determinations to help reinforce guidance and
      enable personnel to mitigate errors. FEMA is also providing detailed instructions
      and examples of information processing that staff should verify on the internet
      and how to appropriately document within the application file record comments.
      In the early stages of COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, the internet search was
      not an option to resolving missing verification points. This was causing multiple
      calls to applicants asking them to provide the information, when funeral homes
      were not responding to verification calls, and leading to a high number of ineligible
      cases. Later guidance was updated to include an internet search in order to
      find information that would help with the verification process and reduce the
      burden on the applicant to provide. The internet search can assist caseworkers
      in finding a phone number of the funeral home, validating the funeral home is
      a valid business and confirming the death occurred by locating an obituary.

    Answer: "The majority of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified\
      \ Improper Payments (IPs) stemmed from the required human intervention for manually\
      \ processing COVID-19 Funeral Assistance disbursements. As such, the majority\
      \ of the FEMA corrective actions taken have focused on policy and procedural\
      \ enhancements, training, and process improvements to reduce and prevent future\
      \ IPs. The COVID-19 pandemic brought overwhelming grief to many families. FEMA\
      \ has remained committed to help people before, during, and after disasters\
      \ and is dedicated to helping ease some of the financial stress and burden caused\
      \ by the virus. \n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, appropriated\
      \ additional funding to the Disaster Relief Fund to reimburse funeral expenses\
      \ incurred through December 31, 2020. Subsequently, the American Rescue Plan\
      \ Act of 2021 (ARPA; enacted March 11,2021) also required FEMA to provide Funeral\
      \ Assistance for deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and did not limit\
      \ the date for expenses incurred. FEMA began accepting applications on April\
      \ 12, 2021 and, per FEMA’s policy, the agency will reimburse for eligible funeral\
      \ expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, for deaths attributed to the COVID-19\
      \ pandemic. Although the COVID-19 incident period ended on May 11, 2023, FEMA\
      \ will continue to provide funeral assistance reimbursements until September\
      \ 30, 2025 to those that have lost loved ones due to the pandemic. \n\nAs highlighted\
      \ above, the FEMA Funeral Assistance program related to the COVID-19 pandemic\
      \ is expected to complete all disbursement activity by the end of fiscal year\
      \ (FY) 2025 and has seen substantial reductions in the program's disbursement\
      \ size and activity already. For example, in the less than six months of FY\
      \ 2021 that FEMA disbursed Funeral Assistance, the program disbursed over $1,166\
      \ million. For the full FY 2022 reporting period, the FEMA Funeral Assistance\
      \ program disbursed just over $1,697 million. Disbursement activity for the\
      \ FEMA Funeral Assistance program is down to just over $300 million in FY 2023.\
      \ With the reduction in the program size coupled with the expected end of the\
      \ program in September 2025, it is not cost beneficial for the agency to implement\
      \ extensive corrective actions for the sunsetting program in FY 2025."

      \ DHS Headquarters as well Components, around improper payments are subject\
      \ to an annual compliance review by the DHS’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).\
      \ These measures are designed to hold the appropriate personnel accountable\

      \ extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable officers, to include\
      \ Component Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), programs, States, and localities\
      \ are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments. The Department’s\
      \ CFO and senior staff have incorporated improper payment expectations and performance\
      \ in their annual performance plans. \n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency\
      \ (FEMA) regularly engages with recipients and process owners in monthly remediation\
      \ meetings to ensure that appropriate accountable officials are actively taking\
      \ actions to reduce Improper Payments (IPs) and identify and categorize Unknown\
      \ Payment (UP) transactions as either proper or improper. If a transaction is\
      \ deemed proper, no further action is taken. If a transaction is deemed technically\
      \ improper, FEMA requires a corrective action be put in place in order resolve\
      \ issues surrounding procedures, policies, and trainings. If a transaction is\
      \ deemed improper and is associated with monetary loss, then the transaction\
      \ is submitted through the FEMA debt collection process including Notice of\
      \ Potential Debt Letters and Treasury Offset, if applicable. \n\nIn addition,\

    Answer: Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Funeral Assistance
      program is reporting an estimated error rate that identifies the program is
      susceptible to significant improper payments, FEMA is confident that the agency
      has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human capital and information
      system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown
      Payments (UPs) to a tolerable rate. FEMA has specific reporting requirements
      established by the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA), as amended.
      The DRRA authorizes FEMA to waive a debt owed to the Government if covered assistance
      provided to an individual or household on or after October 28, 2012, was distributed
      in error by FEMA or if such assistance is subject to a claim or legal action.
      Section 1216(a)(3) of the DRRA requires the DHS Office of the Inspector General
      (OIG) to monitor FEMA’s distribution of covered assistance to individuals and
      households to determine the percentage distributed based on an error. Should
      the error rate exceed 4 percent of the total amount of covered assistance distributed,
      the DRRA requires FEMA to report actions it will take to reduce the error rate
      to congressional committees. FEMA will continue to strive to improve the IP
      rates for the Funeral Assistance program with the existing resourcing. However,
      as error rates continue to be reported below the 4 percent threshold established
      by the DRRA to prompt for congressional notification and attention, FEMA is
      confident that the agency does not specifically need additional human capital,
      information system and other infrastructure, etc. resourcing to sustain and
      further reduce the estimated error rate for the program.

    Answer: Due to the nature of the Public Assistance program, the Federal Emergency
      Management Agency (FEMA) is reliant on additional parties, such as states, territories,
      etc., to oversee and execute payments on behalf of the program. However, FEMA
      has direct oversight over drawdown activity for the program in order to support
      the payment or reimbursement to the state and local entities. As such, DHS believes
      that all payments disbursed, as reviewed through the drawdown activity reviewed
      under the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), are within the agency's
      control. Therefore, all resulting improper payments, to include overpayments,
      have also been determined to be within the control of the agency.

    Answer: "Public Assistance is designed to reimburse everything from an hour of\
      \ overtime to the replacement of an entire wastewater treatment facility. It\
      \ is designed to be flexible and support the range of recovery needs. The program\
      \ delivery model, built on standard roles and processes, enables the Federal\
      \ Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to employ a risk-based approach that recognizes\
      \ that not all Applicants or projects require the same level of resources, documentation,\
      \ or oversight. FEMA adjusts its approach based on risks. The risk-based approach\
      \ balances developing policy, delivering the program, and prioritizing resources\
      \ to maintain an efficient use of resources. FEMA prioritizes resources and\
      \ effort where risk and complexity are high. That means ensuring personnel and\
      \ technical resources are made available, and administrative oversight is more\
      \ in-depth, where a disaster, Applicant, or project represents a higher risk\
      \ in one or more of the four risk areas–Mission, Finances, Program, and Reputation.\
      \ By contrast, FEMA limits level of effort, resources, and administrative oversight\
      \ where risk is low. That means assigning fewer personnel or technical resources\
      \ and decreasing requirements and level of review where an applicant or project\
      \ does not pose a significant risk in one or more of the four risk areas. \n\
      \nThe root causes of the Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs)\
      \ have remained consistent over the last 24-months of consecutive testing, covering\
      \ fiscal year (FY) 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity. Generally, UPs steadily\
      \ account for approximately 90 percent of the overall reported error rate and\
      \ valuation. FEMA continues to work with recipients on obtaining additional\
      \ information and missing documentation for the UPs. To assist in obtaining\
      \ sufficient supporting documentation in a timely manner, FEMA remains committed\
      \ to streamlining and automating the Public Assistance process, training relevant\
      \ parties and stakeholders, ensuring that policy and process documentation is\
      \ current and available, and maintaining consistent and regular oversight through\
      \ internal reviews and audit activity while not overburdening grant recipients."

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is confident that resourcing
      is sufficient to establish and maintain internal controls, human capital, and

      \ FEMA has learned that emergency management is a shared responsibility among\
      \ the whole community, where disaster operations are federally supported, State\
      \ managed, and locally executed. The FY 2025 Budget request continues investments\

      \ emergency management: \n\n1.\tInstill Equity as a Foundation of Emergency\
      \ Management\n•\tCultivate a FEMA that prioritizes and harnesses a diverse workforce\n\
      •\tRemove barriers to FEMA programs through a people first approach\n•\tAchieve\
      \ equitable outcomes for those that FEMA serves\n\n2.\tLead Whole of Community\
      \ in Climate Resilience\n•\tIncrease climate literacy among the emergency management\
      \ community\n•\tBuild a climate resilient nation\n•\tEmpower risk-informed decision\
      \ making\n\n3.\tPromote and Sustain a Ready FEMA and Prepared Nation\n•\tStrengthen\
      \ the emergency management workforce\n•\tPosture FEMA to meet current and emergent\
      \ threats\n•\tUnify coordination and delivery of federal assistance \n\nThe\
      \ Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the appropriation FEMA uses to direct, coordinate,\
      \ manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic\
      \ major disasters and emergencies that overwhelm State and tribal resources\
      \ pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance\
      \ Act, P.L. 93-288 (as amended), 42 U.S. Code sections 5121-5207. Specifically,\
      \ the DRF can provide funding for Stafford Act declarations or activities that\
      \ include: (1) pre-declaration surge activities; (2) emergency declarations;\
      \ (3) major disaster declarations; (4) fire management assistance grants (FMAGs);\
      \ and (5) Disaster Readiness and Support (DRS) activities. Through the DRF,\
      \ FEMA can authorize Federal disaster support activities as well as eligible\
      \ State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) actions such as emergency protection\
      \ and debris removal. The DRF also funds the repair and rebuilding of eligible\
      \ disaster damaged infrastructure, eligible hazard mitigation projects, financial\
      \ assistance to eligible disaster survivors, and FMAGs for eligible large wildfires.\
      \ In the DHS FY 2025 Budget, FEMA has requested:\n•\tA major disaster allocation\
      \ to address ongoing Stafford Act disasters. The FY 2025 budget request includes\
      \ funding for continued recovery efforts in support of COVID-19, Hurricanes\
      \ Maria, Fiona, and Ian, and other disaster activity. \n\nIn addition, Operations\
      \ and Support (O&S) provides core mission development and maintenance of an\
      \ integrated, nationwide capability to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and\
      \ recover from the consequences of major disasters and emergencies regardless\
      \ of cause, in partnership with other Federal agencies, SLTT governments, volunteer\
      \ organizations, and the private sector. Activities supported by this account\
      \ incorporate the essential command and control functions, mitigate long-term\
      \ risks, ensure the continuity and restoration of essential services and functions\
      \ and provide leadership to build, sustain, and improve the coordination and\
      \ delivery of support to citizens and SLTT governments. In the DHS FY 2025 Budget,\
      \ FEMA has requested:\n•\tA program change to the O&S related to Disaster Workforce\
      \ Readiness. The increase in staffing would provide training and education enhancements\
      \ for the FEMA Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT) and Federal Coordinating\
      \ Officer (FCO) cadres. The staffing increase is for critical and highly specialized\
      \ positions, closing capability gaps and ensuring the Agency is ready to respond\
      \ to disasters of increasing frequency and impacts and meet the need of survivors.\
      \ Laws such as the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, the Post Sandy\
      \ Recovery Act, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 have set requirements\
      \ for FEMA to gain and maintain capabilities to not only coordinate the Federal\
      \ family’s ability to provide lifesaving and life sustaining resources and activities\
      \ during disasters, but to also be the industry leader in training and education\
      \ of the emergency management field across all levels of society. Government\
      \ Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reports\
      \ and findings have identified where FEMA has experienced successes, shortcomings,\
      \ and gaps in mission delivery and have provided recommendations on how and\
      \ where to apply resources to address shortfall. This includes FEMA’s ability\
      \ to execute the requirements established in Section 302 (Coordinating Officers)\
      \ and Section 303 (Emergency Support and Response Teams) of the Stafford Act.\
      \ Developing and maintaining professional development programs for FCOs and\
      \ IMATs is necessary to advance the Administrator’s stated goals for the management\
      \ and support of FEMA’s field leaders. These requirements, both new and with\
      \ enhancements to existing programs, will enhance the readiness of FEMA’s FCO\
      \ and IMAT cadres and will enable increased Field Leadership capabilities.\n\
      •\tA program change to the O&S related to Grants Management Modernization (GMM).\
      \ The increase in funding would allow for the sustainment of the Grants Management\
      \ Modernization (GMM) Program FEMA Grant Outcomes (FEMA GO), Preparedness Grant\
      \ Systems Portfolio (PGSP), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Environmental\
      \ and Historic Preservation Management Information System (EMIS), and Mitigation\
      \ Electronic Grants (MT-eGrants). With these additional resources FEMA will\
      \ be able to manage risk and implement sufficient controls over the grants that\
      \ it administers as well as provide mission critical services and support to\
      \ disaster survivors, program staff, and stakeholders. Specifically, these resources\
      \ will enable the Legacy Grant Management Systems to provide adequate system’s\
      \ operation and maintenance capabilities to improve the cybersecurity protection\
      \ for FEMA’s intellectual property, including the FEMA GO software, and protect\
      \ recipient data and FEMA data contained in the FEMA GO system. \n\nFor additional\
