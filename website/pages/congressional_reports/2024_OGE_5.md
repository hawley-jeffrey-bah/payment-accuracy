SurveyData:
- Answer: OGE has determined that it is not cost effective to conduct recovery audits
    in certain programs. OGE has no programs that meet PIAA criteria and agency payments
    are normally so small that conducting audit activity to determine and resolve
    a potential improper payment would likely cost much more in time and effort than
    the overpayment.  With the extensive internal controls both at OGE and BFS and
    the small number and amounts of payments made, no improper payments have been
    identified or made negating the need to conduct recovery audits. Recovery audits
    are not cost effective for OGE.
