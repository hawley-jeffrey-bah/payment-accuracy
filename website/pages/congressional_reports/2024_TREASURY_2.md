    Answer: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to review and adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters
      for audit selection of returns claiming the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC).
      Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines the IRS filters to better
      prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors; this helps prevent improper
      payments by intervening earlier in the process. The annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meeting helps to mitigate the refundable tax credits (RTCs) improper payment
      primary root causes (1) data/information needed does not exist at the point
      of return filing and (2) inability to access data/information at the time the
      return is filed. Due to the taxpayerâ€™s misrepresentation or misunderstanding
      of key points of eligibility requirements, especially for self-employment or
      other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties, and reliance on taxpayer
      self-certification, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved
      compliance filters can enhance these issues after returns are filed but before
      payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result
      of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur.

    Answer: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements with the Office
      of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and the Social Security Administration (SSA)
      to access critical information that aids in validating eligibility for the Additional
      Child Tax Credit (ACTC). This data-sharing involves the exchange of key data
      points, such as income verification, household composition and income limits
      and the eligibility to claim certain dependents. With this information, the
      IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements
      for the ACTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing allows the IRS to detect discrepancies
      in taxpayer filings, such as misreported income or invalid dependent claims,
      and prevent improper payments during the return processing stage. Another root
      cause of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) is taxpayer misreporting
      or misunderstanding of eligibility requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily
      on taxpayer self-reported information, taxpayers may inaccurately claim the
      ACTC due to misunderstanding income limits or dependency. By leveraging third-party
      data sources from OCSE and SSA, the IRS can verify key elements of returns.
      This is especially important given the lack of a pre-approval process for these
      credits. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives;
      accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu
      of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate
      returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers
      claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct
      payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers
      and the IRS.

    Answer: The IRS will continue to educate tax professionals on their due diligence
      requirements regarding the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), through venues
      such as the annual IRS Nationwide Tax Forums and the Latino Tax Fest. These
      events provide a platform for the IRS to reach a broad audience of tax preparers,
      helping them understand their obligations when assisting taxpayers in claiming
      the AOTC. This is important because a root cause of AOTC improper payments is
      misunderstanding the eligibility criteria for the credit. Because tax preparers
      assist in filing returns claiming refundable tax credits (RTCs), any lack of
      awareness or lack of oversight at the preparer level has a cascading effect
      on improper payments. Training will help clarify what is required to substantiate
      claims, such as documentation for qualifying educational expenses. The IRS is
      re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the
      IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional
      pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly
      fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and
      deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
      issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Answer: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements with the Department
      of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
      (CMS) to access critical information that aids in validating eligibility for
      the Premium Tax Credit (PTC). This data-sharing involves the exchange of key
      data points, such as income thresholds and enrollment in a qualified health
      plan. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers
