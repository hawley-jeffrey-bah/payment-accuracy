SurveyData:
- Answer: VA experiences overpayments identified in recovery audits  due to administrative
    and processing errors, non-compliance with contract billing requirements on federal
    supply schedule contracts, salary overpayments due to corrected timecards or personnel
    actions, processing dependency claims, and improper billing and coding errors.
    These conditions are being resolved by implementing corrective actions utilizing
    mitigation strategies and corrective actions that are appropriate to the severity
    of the error.

- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in\
    \ five major areas: Veterans Health Administration through a recovery audit, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center\
    \ in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center\
    \ which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes\
    \ Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices\
    \ (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the\
    \ Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness),\
    \ as well as specific recovery audits performed for the Supply Fund payments in\
    \ the Office of the Revolving Fund.  These are discussed in more detail below.\n\
    \nVeterans Health Administration\nVHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which\
    \ will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims\
    \ paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care\
    \ rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based\
    \ on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic\
    \ related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported\
    \ are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract. \n                \
    \                                                                            \
    \   \nVeterans Benefits Administration\nVeterans Benefits Administration uses\
    \ a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates\
    \ and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs\
    \ perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations,\
    \ proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate\
    \ payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined\
    \ efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting\
    \ Center, and Regional Offices.\n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial Services\
    \ Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery\
    \ audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration,\
    \ Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices.  The Financial Services\
    \ Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments\
    \ for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million\
    \ or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments\
    \ in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate\
    \ payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The\
    \ Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection\
    \ for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment\
    \ was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter\
    \ of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction.\
    \ In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the\
    \ improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical\
    \ facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds\
    \ for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned\
    \ the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection,\
    \ an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued\
    \ payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts\
    \ to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt\
    \ service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s)\
    \ to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs\
    \ can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing.\
    \ Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a\
    \ permanent alternative is identified by the customer.\n\nOffice of Revolving\
    \ Funds\nThe Office of Revolving Fund collaborates with the Office of Inspector\
    \ General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of\
    \ Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then\
    \ prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection.\
    \ If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will\
    \ work towards appropriate resolution."

- Answer: VA programs that have determined that it is not cost-effective to conduct
    recovery audits have documented their justifications through a cost benefit analysis.
    For FY 2023, VA had 19 programs where conducting recovery audits would not be
    cost-effective. Whenever possible, VA utilizes quantitative factors, such as recovery
    amounts and actual costs incurred in recovery audits to determine if the benefits
    of a payment recovery audit program would exceed the costs associated with identification
    and recovery of overpayments. Lacking full quantitative data, VA will also utilize
    qualitative factors to determine if the benefits of a payment recovery audit program
    would exceed the costs associated with identification and recovery of overpayments.
    Qualitative factors evaluate the likelihood that identified overpayments would
    be recovered and the likelihood that the expected recoveries would be greater
    than the costs incurred to identify and recover overpayments. Each of the 19 programs
    determined that conducting a recovery audit would not be cost effective due to
    the costs or expected costs of the related recovery audit outweighing the collectable
    overpayments.
