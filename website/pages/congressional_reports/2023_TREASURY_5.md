SurveyData:
- Answer: Many of Treasury's overpayments are payroll related. These overpayments
    include issues such as corrected timecards, FEGLI corrections, duplicate cash
    awards, etc. Treasury also had contract overpayments which include duplicate amounts
    or incorrect amounts. Many of these overpayments were identified and recovered
    through post payment audits.

- Answer: 'Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are subject
    to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for that
    month. Invoices not processed through the IPP in excess of $2,500.00 are subject
    to secondary review before being paid. Invoices under $2,500.00 are subject to
    review through statistical sampling procedures. Travel vouchers processed through
    the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel system are subject to a post payment
    audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements under $2,500. All payments
    of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population. These payments require
    a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed through the MoveLINQ
    system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review. For payment customers,
    once the vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment, they are interfaced
    to Oracle, the financial system, through which they are paid.


    The DNP portal implementation has provided a way for our procurement and payable
    offices to review vendor files prior to disbursement. It has also given us an
    opportunity to review the monthly payment file results to identify any improper
    payments made to a vendor in the DNP portal.'

- Answer: 'Majority of these cases were erroneous personnel actions that when corrected
    resulted in overpayment to the employee.


    5 U.S.C. Section 5584 authorizes waivers of debt claims due to the United States
    if it can be shown there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault,
    or lack of good faith on the part of the employee. Since the debt was established
    due to a corrected personnel action, the decision to grant or deny the waiver
    turns on fault. Fault exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is found
    that the individual knew or should have known that they received an erroneous
    payment.'

- Answer: "Fiscal Service programs- Management has determined that conducting recovery\
    \ audits would not be cost-effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based on the\
    \ public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies. Although,\
    \ a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted before\
    \ all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to request\
    \ exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.\n\nInternal Revenue\
    \ Service (IRS) Programs- Per OMB's letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for\
    \ Management, dated March 20, 2014, IRS custodial/bond programs are exempt from\
    \ Payment Recapture Auditing. Treasury determined that it considers these payments\
    \ negative revenue receipts- not outlays- and thereby\nexempt them from improper\
    \ payment requirements. OMB believed this is a reasonable approach, however these\
    \ custodial/bond programs are still required to assess for risk. IRS programs\
    \ that are not custodial/bond programs submitted a justification to OMB in 2016\
    \ to exempt them from recovery auditing. The five year average cost of recovery\
    \ auditing far exceeded the average improper payments identified. No improper\
    \ payments were recaptured through recovery auditing, however, all funds recaptured\
    \ were identified through normal operating processes and collected through established\
    \ procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes of preventing,\
    \ identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications,\
    \ and task orders.\n\nIRS- fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic created\
    \ through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, including the Child and Dependent\
    \ Care Tax Credit, provided a justification for determination that recovery auditing\
    \ is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current business practices (e.g., audit reports,\
    \ self-reported overpayments, statistical samples conducted under PIIA) provide\
    \ an efficient and effective means for identification of overpayments. The IRS’s\
    \ robust information\ntechnology platform includes several filters to monitor\
    \ the accuracy of eligibility\nrules and payment certification for the various\
    \ tax credits.\n\nThe Office of International Assistance provided a cost-effective\
    \ justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments for this fund group\
    \ can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit which are administered\
    \ by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash payments via the Secure\
    \ Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before all payments are made.\
    \ Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective to perform formal\
    \ recovery auditing on this fund group.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the\
    \ Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing\
    \ to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper\
    \ payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments\
    \ - invoices, travel card, purchase card,\npayroll, and benefits) has resulted\
    \ in a low risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls\
    \ over payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal\
    \ reviews of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC\
    \ performs an annual review using analytic techniques of contract payments to\
    \ identify potential fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has\
    \ very low delinquency and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase\
    \ cards and for expenditures of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures.\
    \ The most recent payment recapture audit activities conducted required a higher\
    \ cost in employee resources than the amount recovered.\n\nThe Treasury Franchise\
    \ Fund submitted a cost-effective justification to OMB in 2018. The qualitative\
    \ risk assessments for this fund group have been low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal\
    \ year recovery audits before the justification was established yielded .01% of\
    \ disbursements for this fund group. This fund group conducts pre-payment and\
    \ post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management determined it would\
    \ not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund group.\n\nThe\
    \ Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective justification\
    \ for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of this justification is the\
    \ BEP's risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments. Prior\
    \ fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates to\n\
    .004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment\
    \ and post-payment reviews.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Economic Stabilization Direct\
    \ Loan Financing program is at low risk for improper payments. This loan program\
    \ is unique in that it contains a limited number of recipients. In FY 2020, there\
    \ were eight recipients that received eight large payments and in total, the program\
    \ disbursed loans to 35 recipients. Program participants entered into stringent\
    \ legal agreements per guidance stipulated in the CARES Act and instituted per\
    \ Treasury. There were significant reviews performed at the onset of the program\
    \ including several levels of review regarding program loan terms and documentation.\
    \ Further, given these disbursements are loans, which are closely monitored for\
    \ potential default, Treasury expects to receive the funds back. \n\nDepartmental\
    \ Office- Payroll Support Program- Since there is a payment recovery process instituted\
    \ within the program’s internal controls system and the risks of improper payments\
    \ are low, the potential benefit of conducting a separate\npayment recapture audit\
    \ is minimal and would be duplicative. This payment recovery process is comprised\
    \ of confirming maximum awardable amounts and verifying that the prorated payments\
    \ are within the established percentages and maximum payments allowed for each\
    \ program participant. The cost of\nperforming a payment recapture audit would\
    \ outweigh any potential benefit.\n\nDepartmental Offices- Coronavirus Economic\
    \ Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS)- The CERTS program identified one\
    \ instance of overpayment, and one instance of ineligibility, both were 100% recaptured,\
    \ and represent less than 0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022,\
    \ the CERTS program has since completed all of its awards to recipients and is\
    \ shifting to the recipient monitoring\nphase of the program. Since there is a\
    \ low prevalence of overpayments and payments to ineligible recipients, and a\
    \ 100% recapture rate, the potential benefit of conducting a separate payment\
    \ recapture audit is minimal. Therefore, the cost of performing a recapture audit\
    \ would outweigh any potential benefit.\n\nDepartmental Office- Coronavirus State\
    \ and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF)- In FY 2021 SLFRF identified three overpayments,\
    \ which were 100% recaptured, and represent less than 1.0% of the total program\
    \ awards. In each of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments\
    \ and were provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury. SLFRF worked\
    \ closely with the ORP Payment Operations team to recoup overpayments and ensure\
    \ the returned amount was documented accurately in the Oracle SAR report, which\
    \ serves as the ORP payment system of record. Since the program has implemented\
    \ multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and quality of\
    \ payment integrity review, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential\
    \ benefit of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal. Therefore,\
    \ the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential\
    \ benefit.\n\nDepartmental Office- Emergency Rental Assistance- Eligibility for\
    \ payments from Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according\
    \ to statutory allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate\
    \ the information, such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility\
    \ of recipients is verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved\
    \ for disbursement after\nundergoing a multi-step validation process to verify\
    \ the recipient, dollar amount, and timing. Once approved, payments are disbursed\
    \ following the standard ORP payments process. Since the program has implemented\
    \ multiple levels of review (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal\
    \ controls system, the risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit\
    \ of conducting a separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\
    \nDepartmental Offices- Homeowner Assistance Fund- Eligibility for payments from\
    \ Treasury to participating entities are made by Treasury according to statutory\
    \ allocations. The payments team uses various systems to validate the information,\
    \ such as Sam.gov, Oracle, and Salesforce. Initial eligibility of recipients are\
    \ verified using the Do Not Pay Portal. Payments are approved for disbursement\
    \ after\nundergoing a multi-step validation process to verify the recipient, dollar\
    \ amount, and timing. Since the program has implemented multiple levels of review\
    \ (drawing from multiple data sources) into its internal controls system, the\
    \ risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a\
    \ separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental\
    \ Offices- Emergency Capital Investment Program- During the application phase,\
    \ ECIP consulted with the primary federal regulators for each applicant (being\
    \ a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive\
    \ funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination\nwith teams\
    \ of community development finance and financial institutions and external financial\
    \ advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision,\
    \ based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls\
    \ and included multiple layers of review. Since the\nprogram has implemented multiple\
    \ levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the\
    \ risks of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a\
    \ separate payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nDepartmental\
    \ Offices/Office of Recovery Programs- Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency\
    \ Fund (LATCF)-  LATCF has maintained its own listing and database of eligible\
    \ primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk of primary recipients\
    \ is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of internal/quality controls\
    \ to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment integrity review, the risks\
    \ of improper payments are low.\n\nDepartmental Offices/Office of Recovery Programs-\
    \ State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)- The SSBCI program team relies\
    \ on a vigorous SSBCI application review process and conducts post-approval procedures\
    \ through SSBCI’s Compliance Program. The application process includes checks\
    \ to validate \nidentity, confirm eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs for\
    \ the payment (grant sizing) formula, as well as verify that the applicant is\
    \ not on exclusion lists (including the Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing\
    \ improper payments.\n\nSpecial Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)-\
    \ SIGPR has an established inter-agency agreement (IAA) and service level agreement\
    \ (SLA) in place with the Treasury’s Administrative Resource Center (ARC) Financial\
    \ Services program for providing financial support services. As it relates\nspecifically\
    \ to recovery processes this includes but is not limited to activities such as\
    \ performing funds control reviews and maintenance on a weekly basis and review\
    \ recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for financial reporting and reconciliations\
    \ on a routine basis to identify, prevent and/or recover improper payments based\
    \ on established thresholds. SIGPR has also developed and implemented policies\
    \ and procedures to ensure controls over payments are implemented, including daily\
    \ financial reporting and reconciliations to identify, prevent and/or recover\
    \ improper payments based on established thresholds.\nSince there are payment\
    \ recovery processes included within the aforementioned policies and procedures\
    \ and the risks of improper payments are low, the potential benefit of conducting\
    \ separate payment recapture audits is minimal and would be duplicative.\n\nOffice\
    \ of DC Pensions (DCP)-  DCP's largest payment area, benefits, has a robust multi-tier\
    \ quality review program that includes in-depth annuitant case review as a part\
    \ of their normal course of business. Through DCP's quality review program, significant\
    \ numbers of annuitant cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are detected,\
    \ benefit payments are corrected and debt collection activities begin, as applicable.\
    \ In addition, all contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include a second\
    \ level review prior to payment submission."
