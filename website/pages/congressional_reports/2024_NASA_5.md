SurveyData:
- Answer: As permitted by OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, NASA has determined to exclude
    recovery audits from its Recovery Audit Program. In FY 2019, NASA performed an
    analysis that indicated that it was not cost-effective to continue conducting
    payment recapture audits for identifying and recovering improper payments. NASA
    continues to monitor and assess its payment platforms to ensure appropriate controls
    are in place to prevent, detect, and collect improper payments.
