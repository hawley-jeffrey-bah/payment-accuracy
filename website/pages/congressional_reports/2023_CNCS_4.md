    Answer: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
      by grantees to support the selected federal expenses charged against the grant.
      There are situations where the grantee is unable to provide the required documentation
      to support the payment or the documentation provided is insufficient. In these
      situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation or
      adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as either
      proper or improper could have been made.

    Answer: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
      by grantees to support the selected federal expenses charged against the grant.
      There are situations where the grantee is unable to provide the required documentation
      to support the payment or the documentation provided is insufficient. In these
      situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation or
      adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as either
      proper or improper could have been made.

    Answer: "The agency is committed to the compliance with the Payment Integrity\
      \ Information Act of 2019 as demonstrated by the agency elevating the reduction\
      \ of improper payments to be a key performance indicator in its strategic plan.\
      \ \n\nThe improper payments reported are made at the grantee level. The improper\
      \ payments are not made at the agency level and largely do not represent a monetary\
      \ loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agency’s\
      \ grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine\
      \ if the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct\
      \ control over the payments, it has implemented updated training to ensure the\
      \ grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.\
      \ The agency also provided resolution packets to grantees at the conclusion\
      \ of the FY 2022 assessment, linking specific root cause drivers of improper\
      \ payments to the corresponding applicable statute, regulation, and available\
      \ training. This will continue for the FY 2023 assessment. In addition, AmeriCorps\
      \ will assess the current training in the coming months to update as needed.\n\
