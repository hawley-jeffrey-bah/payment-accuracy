- Answer: "In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program\
    \ was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements (3, 4,\
    \ 5b and 6).    \n\nThe OIG determination was based upon the FEHB Program not\
    \ reporting an Improper Payment Estimate in FY 2023. The OIG recommended OPM issue\
    \ an improper payment estimate for the Federal Employees Health Benefit program\
    \ that will allow OPM to be in compliance with PIIA reporting requirements in\
    \ future reporting years. \n\nOPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed\
    \ for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management\
    \ and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB\
    \ Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to\
    \ significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in\
    \ FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.\
    \  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program\
    \ should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The\
    \ FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment\
    \ types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting\
    \ meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans. Off-cycle\
    \ risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB\
    \ Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.\
    \  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible\
    \ to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper\
    \ and unknown payment estimate.\n\nOPM developed a new improper payment methodology\
    \ in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to\
    \ meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15\
    \ Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This\
    \ Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide,\
    \ which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB\
    \ Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment\
    \ reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and\
    \ Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants.\
    \ OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the\
    \ FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their\
    \ data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025."
