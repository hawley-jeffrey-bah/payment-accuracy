    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience (CCE) application.  CCE
      will be a single-entry point for employees to process all agency benefits.  CCE
      includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake processing and post-entitlement
      activities.  CCE will automate more computations, reduce manual actions, assist
      in the identification of potential or missed entitlements, and include dynamic
      pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently, only Supplemental
      Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional claim types (i.e.,
      Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18) to be added in future
      releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we released several CCE updates in the
      SSI program to improve the system.  In FY 2024, we will release several additional
      CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts to expand on additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Medicare)
      for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The
      CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process,
      increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted
      product is comprised of four separate workstreams, across several component
      business and systems sponsors.  In addition to work CDRs, the Product aims to
      modernize the medical CDR process with the addition of online service options
      and reduce paper case processing by automating current Electronic Disability
      Collect System exclusions.  In February 2023, CDR product released the i454
      which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or
      a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician''s
      process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2024, we plan to release Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the Electronic
      Disability Collect System (EDCS) that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.
      and plan to make the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We
      are currently beginning the development of a  modernized version of eWork which
      will eventually be integrated into the existing EDCS application and will make
      EDCS available for field office technicians.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021,
      we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs
      that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation
      (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with
      processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, six
      BOTs have been created and placed into production.  Use of the BOTs reduces
      keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In
      FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and
      implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input
      of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term
      investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes
      and eliminate manual actions.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to the all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or
      information needed, we inform Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance beneficiaries
      about their reporting responsibilities.  Section 826 of the Bipartisan Budget
      Act of 2015 required the Commissioner to establish and implement a system permitting
      DI beneficiaries to report their earnings electronically.  Our myWageReport
      (myWR) online application, allows DI beneficiaries, Supplemental Security Income
      (SSI) recipients, concurrent beneficiaries, and representative payees to report
      wages and view, print, or save a receipt.  DI self-reporters and their representative
      payees can report wages that occurred within a two-year timeframe from the reporting
      date.  We promote use of our online wage reporting application, myWageReport
      (myWR), on social media with training videos depicting three reporting options:  my
      Social Security, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting, and SSI Telephone Wage Reporting.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplifying our notices.  Although we made efforts
      to simplify notices, some of our notices and communications can be complex,
      lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from
      the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain
      information.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the
      quality and understandability of our communications.  We will inform and remind
      beneficiaries about reporting responsibilities.'

    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does
      not exist and inability to access the data or information needed, we will pursue
      new data exchange partners from government and private sectors in collaboration
      with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand our outreach efforts with
      the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States Data Exchange Community
      of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the expansion of best practices
      toward streamlining the exchange of data.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a
      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical
      State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and
      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment Compensation
      Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’ compensation
      program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), provides coverage
      to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of FECA benefits can offset
      Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits.  SSA and DOL have agreed
      to move forward with our request for DOL FECA data.  We are working to finalize
      the agreement for DOL to provide FECA payment data to assist us in our offset
      requirements.  We expect the exchange to be completed in fiscal year 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, and failure to access data or information needed, and to reduce the
      reliance on self-reporting of wages, we are developing new wage reporting tools,
      such as an information exchange with commercial payroll data providers authorized
      by section 824 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the
      Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We have completed several phases of pre-implementation
      development and are drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations
      for the PIE process.  We will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after
      the final rule (regulation) is established.  We will perform ongoing assessments
      while working towards full implementation.'

    Answer: To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we look for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries
      who are working and it may affect their eligibility to receive OASDI benefits.  WorkSmart
      is a tool that identifies Disability Insurance beneficiaries whose earnings
      put them at risk for being overpaid.  We created the WorkSmart project to reduce
      and prevent Improper Payments and complete work Continuing Disability Reviews
      more efficiently by identifying earnings earlier, identifying cases that have
      earnings above substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are still receiving benefits,
      and prioritizing cases that are most likely to end in an SGA cessation.  This
      helps prevent beneficiaries from building overpayment debts.

    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or
      information needed, we inform Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients
      and representative payees about their reporting responsibilities through various
      methods:  during interviews, with application and redetermination forms, in
      some award and post-eligibility notices, in check envelope enclosures, and in
      a booklet that accompanies award notices.  Our annual Cost of Living Adjustment
      notices include reminders about reporting changes that could affect payments
      and eligibility.  In September 2013, we implemented an automated SSI wage reporting
      reminder for individuals who sign up to receive a monthly email or text message
      to report wages for the prior month.  We promote use of our online wage reporting
      application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with training videos including
      information about the importance of creating a my Social Security account; how
      to submit wages using myWR, SSA Mobile Wage Reporting, or SSI Telephone Wage
      Reporting; who can report; and reminders on reporting responsibilities.  In
      November 2022, we issued reporting responsibilities reminders to SSI recipients
      with a my Social Security account.  Finally, we engage the advocate community
      and other third-party groups and organizations to help the us reach more people
      who depend on our services by emailing Dear Colleague letters.  In August 2023,
      we sent a Dear Colleague letter asking for their assistance in reminding SSI

    Answer: 'Our Agency Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022-2026 established
      the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper payments caused
      by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access the data or
      information needed, and failure to access data or information needed, we are
      proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We
      are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:


      Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February
      2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food
      assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition
      of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.


      Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October
      2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment
      of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of
      the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need
      their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental
      Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.


      Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM
      published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception
      in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM
      if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In
      April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified
      SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the
      SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the
      existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten
      the application process for SSI disability applicants.

    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or
      information needed and failure to access data or information needed, we developed
      Access to Financial Institutions (AFI).  The purpose of AFI is to identify excess
      resources in financial accounts, which are a leading cause of Supplemental Security
      Income (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program uses an electronic process with
      participating financial institutions to verify bank account balances and detect
      undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks.  We will be evaluating the benefit
      to running AFI between the SSI initial application and subsequent eligibility
      redeterminations, based on an Office of the Inspector General recommendation.  In
      March 2023, we released Policy in Focus training and issued a frontline broadcast
      to remind technicians of AFI and SSI financial accounts policy.  In August 2023,
      we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account Verification Reminders and issued
      a frontline broadcast to ensure that technicians are reviewing the financial
      account pages in the SSI claims path for accuracy before adjudicating an event.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information

      sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand
      our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States
      Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the
      expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  For FY
      2023 we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These
      data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child''s foster placement
      has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding
      this exchange.

      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist
      and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change
      of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the United States
      Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
      program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an
      address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically
      posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion
      to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  Based on NCOA data analysis,
      we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility
      of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating the notices to inform SSI
      recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding
      their living situation.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist,
      inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data

    Answer: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or
      information needed and failure to access data or information needed, we conduct
      non-medical Supplemental Security Income (SSI) redeterminations (RZ).  A non-medical
      SSI RZ is a complete review of a recipient’s or couple’s non-medical eligibility
      factors (resources, income, and living arrangements) to determine whether the
      recipient or couple has remained eligible since the time of the previous decision,
      is still eligible for SSI, and has been receiving and will continue to receive
      the correct SSI payment amount.  To ensure the most cost-effective investment
      of agency resources, we use a predictive model to estimate the likelihood and
      magnitude of overpayments to select cases for discretionary RZs.  Other cases
      are selected for RZs outside our modeling process based on selected case characteristics,
      such as manual deeming of income.  The RZ process also selects limited issue
      (LI) reviews, which are reviews of a specific issue or event related to a recipient’s
      or couple’s non-medical eligibility factors to determine whether the recipient
      or couple is still eligible for and receiving the correct SSI payment.  In December
      2022, we issued guidance on achieving fiscal year (FY) 2023 RZ and LI workload
      goals, with reminders to field offices about best practices and following the
      order of priority when scheduling RZs and LIs.  In FY 2023, we completed more
      than 2.5 million SSI non-medical RZs and LIs.  We plan to process about 2.5
      million SSI RZs and LIs in FY 2024.
