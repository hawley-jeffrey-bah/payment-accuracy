    Answer: Actions planned include conducting quarterly matches with the Social Security
      Administration to identify variances between Social Security Administration
      income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary
      to VA. Differences indicate potential changes in a beneficiary’s income, which
      could require a change to their pension benefit. Validating whether a change
      is needed and making changes if necessary, prevents future improper payments.
      To address the root cause, VA will use the existing match between Social Security
      Administration income data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This
      enables VA to identify variances which are indicators of potential overpayments.
      Claims with variances are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches
      to resolve discrepancies, adjust benefits if appropriate, and prevent future
      overpayments. These actions are designed to reduce future improper payment errors
      associated with failure to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment
      amounts and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation strategy in order to
      improve accuracy and accessibility of data to validate beneficiary income prior
      to payment.

    Answer: Actions planned include training staff to ensure policies and procedures
      are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future
      improper payments. To address the root cause, training will focus on human errors
      identified during FY 2024 payment integrity testing. These actions are designed
      to reduce future improper payment errors associated with failure to access data/information
      needed to ensure proper payment amounts and unknown payments attributed to being
      unable to determine whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation
      strategy in order to improve awareness and increase skills to improve accurate
      pension rate decisions prior to payment.

    Answer: Actions planned include randomly reviewing claims processors’ work to
      ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension
      rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. Due to human errors, corrective
      action will include conducting focused reviews to ensure claims processors properly
      apply policies and procedures in making accurate pension rate decisions. These
      actions are designed to reduce future improper payment errors associated with
      failure to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts and
      unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Audit was the best mitigation strategy in order to identify systemic discrepancies
      and reinforce adherence to policies and procedures to improve accurate pension
      rate decisions prior to payment.

    Answer: Actions planned include updating the claims processing system to pay Bowel
      and Bladder and Community Nursing Home claims appropriately. These actions are
      designed to reduce underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information
      and technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of the
      program were not met. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because improper
      payments resulted from manual processes and human error.

    Answer: Actions planned include working internally with facilities to provide
      education and training to resolve missing documentation errors related to authorization,
      payment or Veteran level of care to support the payment process. These actions
      are designed to reduce unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine
      whether proper or improper. Training was the best mitigation strategy to communicate
      the importance of consistencies in standard operating procedures.

    Answer: Actions planned include moving to a standardized rate schedule for Community
      Nursing Home payments in order to transition payments from a legacy system to
      an automated claims adjudication system. Additionally, VA will continue clarifing
      payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct rates,
      and will implement short and long term contracting options for Community Nursing
      Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. In addition,
      VA will resolve contracting requirements involving missing signatures and inability
      to reconcile procurement vendor to invoice vendor, and will work to establish
      Veterans Care Agreements when appropriate. These actions are designed to address
      overpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper
      payments attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met, and unknown
      payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger
      internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

    Answer: Actions planned include ensuring contract language is clear and clarify
      any inconsistent payment methodology instances with third-party administrators
      regarding payment discrepancies. Additionally, VA will engage in a contract
      modification to further elaborate on standard episode of care claims processing.
      In addition, VA will ensure timely filing criteria is clear and proper monitoring
      is in place. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop
      stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

      was the best mitigation strategy to help identify overpayments and perform a
      follow-up process.

SurveyData:
- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail\
    \ below.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration\
    \ utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian\
    \ Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community\
    \ Care, and Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the\
    \ reimbursement was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical\
    \ records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.  The VA\
    \ Community Care review also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United\
    \ States Code § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered\
    \ is in compliance with the authorization/referral.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\n\
    \nThe Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and\
    \ payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority\
    \ of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly\
    \ selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing,\
    \ and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other\
    \ potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and\
    \ recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the\
    \ Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional\
    \ Offices. \n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\n\nThe Office of Revolving Funds collaborates\
    \ with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply\
    \ Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and\
    \ a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with\
    \ appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of\
    \ collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution."
