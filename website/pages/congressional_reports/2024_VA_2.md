- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail\
    \ below.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration\
    \ utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian\
    \ Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community\
    \ Care, and Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the\
    \ reimbursement was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical\
    \ records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.  The VA\
    \ Community Care review also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United\
    \ States Code ยง 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered\
    \ is in compliance with the authorization/referral.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\n\
    \nThe Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and\
    \ payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority\
    \ of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly\
    \ selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing,\
    \ and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other\
    \ potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and\
    \ recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the\
    \ Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional\
    \ Offices. \n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\n\nThe Office of Revolving Funds collaborates\
    \ with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply\
    \ Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and\
    \ a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with\
    \ appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of\
    \ collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution."
