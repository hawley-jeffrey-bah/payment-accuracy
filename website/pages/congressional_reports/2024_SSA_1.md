  AdditionalInformation: 'Our fiscal year (FY) 2024 improper payment risk assessment
    of FY 2023 administrative payments included a review of Payroll and Benefits,
    State Disability Determination Services (DDS), and Other Administrative Expenses.  We
    will not have all FY 2024 data until January 2025.


    Payroll and benefits account for a majority of our total administrative expenses.  For
    FY 2023, we found approximately $3.35 million in improper payroll overpayments
    out of $7,925 million payroll payments, which yielded a 0.04 percent improper
    overpayment rate.


    For State DDS payments, our 10 regional offices review amounts drawn against pre-approved
    DDS spending plans.  For payment accuracy, our Office of the Inspector General
    reviews the DDS payments on a rotational basis.  We use our Inspector General’s
    findings, if any, to enhance our payment controls.


    From the Other Administrative Expenses category, we review vendor and employee
    travel payments using an existing internal recovery activities program with tools
    to aid in the detection and recovery of improper overpayments, including:  an
    automated query system to identify duplicate payments made to the same vendor,
    with the same invoice date, and for the same amount; an annual payment accuracy
    review examining select criteria on a random sample of payments to identify IPs
    or a weakness in the internal payment recapture audit program; and a risk assessment
    of administrative payment systems and recovery of any overpayments identified
    in this process.


    We identified total FY 2023 vendor and travel improper overpayments of $0.92 million,
    approximately 0.05 percent of total payments subject to review.


    As part of our review of Other Administrative Expenses, we reviewed our Inspector
    General (IG) report, Fiscal Year 2023 Periodic Assessment of the Social Security
    Administration’s Charge Card Programs, which was published in April 2024.  OIG
    stated the following regarding the results of the assessment:  “We determined
    the risk of illegal, improper, and erroneous purchases made through SSA’s charge
    card programs is low.  SSA implemented safeguards and internal controls to prevent
    waste, fraud, and abuse of purchase cards, travel cards, and CBAs by designing
    its policies and procedures to address the requirements in the Act and OMB Circular
    A-123, Appendix B.”


    In addition, in May 2020, we performed administrative fraud risk assessments to
    actively measure the effectiveness of the internal controls over the processing
    of grants, large contracts, and travel and purchase cards.  These FY 2020 assessments
    found that our management-related risks for these administrative payments fall
    well below the OMB threshold.  In FY 2024, we conducted a maintenance assessment
    in the administrative fraud program areas consistent with Government Accountability
    Office guidance.


    We also leveraged the results of an independent accounting firm’s FY 2018 residual
    risk assessment in support of our FMFIA Internal Control Program.  This assessment
    found that our administrative expenses, accounts payables, human resources, and
    payroll management-related residual risks are low overall.  Testing over the years,
    including our FY 2024 internal testing of controls in those areas confirmed that
    the residual risk remains low.


    Results from our comprehensive recovery activities program and quality review
    process confirm that our administrative payments are well below the Office of
    Management and Budget threshold for reporting IPs.
