  AdditionalInformation: The FY 2024 risk assessment process was updated to enhance
    compliance and evaluate all programs with annual outlays over $10 million. HHS
    established a program inventory and a 3-year assessment cycle, leveraging technology
    to expand assessments and reduce the burden, which helped close a previous GAO
    recommendation. These updates streamline the process, improve risk management,
    and minimize administrative workload.
