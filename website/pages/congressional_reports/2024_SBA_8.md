- Answer: "Requirement 1a: The OIG found the SBA did not publish payment integrity\
    \ information in its FY 2023 AFR for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF),\
    \ Shuttered Venues Operator Grant (SVOG), and the payments for covered loans in\
    \ the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The\
    \ SBA will be publishing RRF improper payment estimates in FY 2024, has begun\
    \ testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays to estimate\
    \ the rate of improper payments and if budget permits, the SBA expects to have\
    \ the improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY 2025, and\
    \ conducted a qualitative risk assessment to identify the susceptibility of improper\
    \ payments for the Debt Relief Program.\nRequirement 1b: The OIG found the SBA\
    \ did not publish payment integrity information in the AFR or any accompanying\
    \ materials for the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for covered loans in the 7(a)\
    \ and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program on the agency’s\
    \ website.  The SBA will be publishing RRF improper payment estimates in FY 2024,\
    \ has begun testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays\
    \ to estimate the rate of improper payments and if budget permits, the SBA expects\
    \ to have the improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY\
    \ 2025, and conducted a qualitative risk assessment to identify the susceptibility\
    \ of improper payments for the Debt Relief Program.\nRequirement 3: The OIG found\
    \ the SBA did not implement adequate sampling and estimation methodology plans\
    \ that are statistically acceptable to produce accurate improper and unknown payment\
    \ estimates that are representative of the Disaster Assistance Loans, COVID-Economic\
    \ Injury Disaster Loans (COVID-EIDL), and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency\
    \ Assistance Advance (EIDL Advance) programs.  To remedy this, the OPPCFO team\
    \ met with the program office staff to understand the population reconciliation\
    \ process and perform a population reconciliation, as needed.  In addition to\
    \ that, the SBA is working closely with supporting staff to ensure reconciliations\
    \ are accurate.\nRequirement 4: The OIG found the SBA did not publish corrective\
    \ actions for the payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty\
    \ programs under the Debt Relief Program, the published corrective actions for\
    \ PPP forgiveness and PPP purchases were not effective, and the published corrective\
    \ action plans for the Disaster Assistance Loans program were not effective as\
    \ they did not adequately address the true root cause of improper payments.  The\
    \ SBA established program specific corrective actions to address the root cause\
    \ of improper payments.  \nRequirement 5b: The OIG found the SBA did not demonstrate\
    \ improvements to payment integrity for 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, 7(a) loan\
    \ guaranty purchases, 504 Certified Development loan approvals, Disaster Assistance\
    \ Loans, and COVID-EIDL as the improper payment estimates increased between FYs\
    \ 2022 and 2023.  In FY 2024, the SBA developed tolerable rates for the 7(a) loan\
    \ guaranty approvals, 7(a) loan guaranty purchases, 504 Certified Development\
    \ loan approvals, and Disaster Assistance Loans programs.\nRequirement 6: The\
    \ OIG found the improper and unknown payment rate estimates were not reliable\
    \ or accurate for the Disaster Assistance Loans, COVID-EIDL, EIDL Advance, PPP\
    \ loan forgiveness, and PPP loan guaranty purchases programs and activities. SBA\
    \ also published improper payment and unknown payment rate estimates greater than\
    \ 10 percent for the PPP loan forgiveness and PPP loan guaranty purchases activities.\
    \ Moreover, SBA did not report improper and unknown payment rate estimates for\
    \ the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty\
    \ programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The SBA is working closely with supporting\
    \ staff to ensure the statistical sampling is accurate to estimate an improper\
    \ payment estimate."
