    Answer: The predominant reasons for 504 Loan Approval improper payments in FY2024
      were (1) CDCs’ failure to determine borrower injection for special purpose projects;
      (2) CDCs’ failure to ensure borrower adhered to all regulations and loan authorization
      requirements for existing SBA loans; and, (3) CDCs’ failure to adequately address
      all collateral concerns.

    Answer: Loans in the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Approval Program are reviewed  at the
      time of approval; these loans are generally made to the right recipient for
      the right amount, but in the approval process, lenders failed to follow all
      statutes and regulations. In these cases, there is no amount that needs to be
      recovered. However, because the lender failed to adhere to all applicable statutes,
      the guaranty is considered technically improper.

    Answer: 7(a) Loan Guaranty Purchase reviews are conducted to determine whether
      lenders complied materially with the 7(a) loan program origination requirements,
      including statutory provisions, SBA regulations, any agreement the lender executed
      with the SBA, standard operating procedures, loan authorizations, and official
      SBA notices and forms applicable to the 7(a) loan program. The reviewers determined
      whether the lender (1) originated, serviced, and liquidated the loan in a prudent
      and commercially reasonable manner, (2) misrepresented or failed to disclose
      a material fact to the SBA, and/or (3) put the SBA’s financial interest at risk.  Loans
      in the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Purchase Program are reviewed at the time of guaranty
      purchase, after SBA has honored its guaranty.

    Answer: Disaster loans are direct loans made by SBA.  Disaster Assistance Loan
      samples are selected from loan disbursements.  A disaster assistance loan may
      have several disbursements before it is disbursed in full.   During the loan
      review process, SBA reviews the original loan processing and underwriting, any
      loan modifications, such as increases in the loan amount or additional borrowers,
      to determine eligibility of the borrower and whether the amount is appropriate.  SBA
      also verifies that the amount of loan is commensurate with the amount of damage.  Finally,
      SBA reviews the actual disbursement to determine that the monies are provided
      to the right person, in the right amount, and for an eligible use of proceeds.

      recovering overpayments.
    Needs1: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human

      and unknown payments to the reduction target.
    Needs2: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission

    Sufficiency: The predominate reasons for improper payments in PPP Loan Forgiveness
      were missing or incomplete documentation, and borrower and lender errors in
      calculation.   A quality control review or internal escalation may help to catch
      these improper payments.

    Answer: Unknown payments in FY2024 were  the result of borrowers or lenders which
      did not provide requested documentation. Those PPP loans with documentation
      requests outstanding were categorized as “Unknown” payments since the SBA did
      not have sufficient supporting documentation to make a determination as to whether
      the forgiveness payment was proper or improper.

    Answer: PPP Loan Guaranty Purchase payments are reviewed after the guaranty has
      been paid to the lender.   Borrower and lender documentation is reviewed to
      determine whether the lender is eligible, and whether the amount of guaranty
      purchase request equaled the amount in SBA systems.  SBA also verifies that
      the lender received borrower certifications, including whether the borrower
      had been in business on or around February 20, 2020.  SBA also checked that
      the eligible payroll was accurately accounted for.

      \ for this program in FY2024, no disbursements will be made in FY2025.  SBA\

      \ to this program.  \n\nNone of the choices provided apply to SBA's corrective\
      \ actions related to this program.  Nevertheless, a choice of action is required.\
      \  Training is selected as it most closely matches the actions SBA has taken\

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Accountability: Review standards are established as part of the agency's annual  appraisal
      process.  These standards hold managers accountable  for meeting applicable
      reduction targets, preventing improper payments, and promptly detecting and
      recovering overpayments.  Nevertheless, this program ended in June 2021.
    Needs1: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human
      capital and information system and other infrastructure.
    Needs2: No additional resources were requested in the most recent budget submission
      of the agency to establish and maintain payment integrity.
    Sufficiency: This program ended in June 2021.  No additional RRF disbursements
      were made in FY2024, and none will be made in FY2025.  As such, SBA has not
      established a corrective action plan specific to this program.

    Answer: At the time of this writing, the SBA had not completed its review of 122
      awards of the 384 awards in the sample of awards originated in FY2021. However,
      for 53 of the 122 Awards, SBA had collected enough information and completed
      a significant portion of the reviews to be able to identify that an improper
      payment is likely.  For 31 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an Award
      calculation error.  For 20 of the 122 Awards, the error stemmed from an eligibility
      issue.

    Answer: The SVOG program was created as a temporary relief program in response
      to the COVID-19 pandemic, with most disbursements occurring within the first
      year.  Following guidance from OMB and the limitations outlined in Appendix
      C, which is written for programs with multiple years of disbursements, the SBA
      is committed to continuing working with the OMB to perform an improper payment
      review for the total disbursements made under the SVOG program.  SBA has begun
      testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays to estimate
      the rate of improper payments.  Budget permitting, the SBA expects to have the
      improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY 2025.
