    Answer: OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively
      engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.  OPM
      requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the data
      needs to be collected and reported to OPM by the health insurance carriers.  In
      FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements
      for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial
      Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial
      reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements
      and improper payment reporting. OPM remains on track for reporting the improper
      and unknown payment estimate in FY 2025.
