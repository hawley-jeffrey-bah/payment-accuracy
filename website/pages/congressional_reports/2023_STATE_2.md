SurveyData:
- Answer: 'The Bureau of the Comptroller and Global Financial Services (CGFS) has
    a two-tiered improper payment monitoring and review program that consists of activities
    performed by the payment issuing office and secondly by the Office of Oversight
    and Management Analysis (OMA). The subsequent review performed by OMA focuses
    on overpayments and utilizes data and risk analysis to drive the recapture work
    performed. While many agencies hire external recapture auditors to perform a secondary
    review, this function is performed more efficiently within the Department by OMA.
    Because the OMA activity is secondary and consistent with a function that an external
    auditor would perform, OMA’s activity is considered recapture as defined by PIIA.


    Domestic vendor payments represent the largest category of Department-made payments
    subject to PIIA recapture audit requirements. OMA utilizes several processes that
    focus on identifying potential improper and duplicate payments. Monthly, as part
    of the Recapture Audit process, OMA conducts a query of domestic vendor payments
    using software to run matches of vendor invoice numbers and payment amounts against
    current payment data and payments from the last 5 years. The CGFS automated duplicate
    payment program using the domestic payment file for recapture audit analysis has
    proven to be a cost-effective tool.


    In addition to the automated IDEA analysis, OMA performs a manual quarterly review
    of overseas and domestic vendor payments. These manual recapture audits validate
    elements such as vendor, payment amount, receipt of goods or services, and ensure
    proper documentation exists to support sampled payments.'
