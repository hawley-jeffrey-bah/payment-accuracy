- Answer: "The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) determined that DHS complied\
    \ with 9 out of 10 Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements.\
    \ The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish improper\
    \ payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) estimates for programs susceptible to\
    \ significant improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement\
    \ to publish IP and UP estimates for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\
    \ Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program in fiscal year (FY) 2023.\
    \ \n\nThe DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the\
    \ PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and\
    \ unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring\
    \ that DHS follows the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reporting requirements\
    \ for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C\
    \ of OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the\
    \ time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered\
    \ open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following\
    \ actions to resolve the OIG recommendations:\n•\tDHS will complete the PIIA Phase\
    \ 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance\
    \ – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY\
    \ 2024 reporting. \n•\tDHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant\
    \ program, to include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance\
    \ for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data\
    \ call for publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. \n\nTo date, DHS has completed\
    \ assessment over the FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity for the FEMA Public\
    \ Assistance – VAYGo program and is publishing improper payment error estimates\
    \ for this 24-month disbursement period in the 2024 reporting cycle. As part of\
    \ the 2024 reporting cycle requirements, DHS is providing information describing\
    \ the actions that the agency has taken and/or will take to come into compliance\
    \ as required per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C requirements for a first-year\
    \ noncompliant program.  Based on the timeline for actions to come into compliance,\
    \ the majority of the associated activities are expected to be fully completed\
    \ in 2024."

- Answer: Ultimately, the DHS Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the accountable official
    for the progress of the agency coming into compliance with the Payment Integrity
    Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). As DHS currently does not have a politically appointed
    and confirmed CFO, the accountable official is currently the Deputy Chief Financial
    Officer, Ms. Stacy Marcott.

- Answer: "The goals and requirements of the Payment Integrity Information Act of\
    \ 2019 (PIIA) are communicated to all levels of staff throughout the Office of\
    \ the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office and procurement staff.\
    \ The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure that managers, accountable\
    \ officers – including Component Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) – programs, and\
    \ states and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper\
    \ payments. \n\nIn addition, the Department’s CFO, Deputy CFO, and senior staff\
    \ have performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship\
    \ incorporated into their annual performance plans. As a strong internal control\
    \ environment is the best way to prevent and detect improper payments, Component\
    \ managers are responsible for completing internal control work on payment processing\
    \ as part of the Department’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No.\
    \ A-123 efforts. They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining\
    \ sufficient internal controls, including a control environment that prevents\
    \ improper payments from being made, effectively managing improper payment risks,\
    \ and promptly detecting and recovering improper payments that may occur.\n\n\
    Performance requirements related to PIIA requirements are included in each DHS\
    \ Component CFO annual performance plan. Execution against these requirements\
    \ is evaluated and measured as part of the end of year performance review. Per\
    \ this review, the performance against established requirements, each Component\
    \ CFO is evaluated to determine whether he/she did not meet, met, or exceeded\
    \ performance expectations which then attributes to annual incentives (i.e., awards,\
    \ recognition, etc.) or consequences (i.e., improvement plan, reassignment, etc.)\
    \ if there are repeated instances where performance deficiencies are noted."
