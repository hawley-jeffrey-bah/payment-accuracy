    Answer: 'FHWA’s Highway Planning and Construction program is not administered
      at the Federal level and overpayments are outside of FHWA control when grant
      recipients make administrative errors. The program supports States and Local
      Public Agencies (LPA) in the design, construction, and maintenance of the Nation’s
      highway system and various federally and tribal owned lands. FHWA funds provides
      the financial resources and mechanism to perform these activities. Tax dollars
      are allocated and distributed by FHWA directly to the State DOTs, as a direct-recipient,
      or LPAs, as sub-recipients, for eligible activities. In turn, the State DOTs
      provide oversight of LPA projects and ensure that local agencies that receive
      and deliver federally funded projects comply with Federal and State requirements.


      In recognition of FHWA’s assignment of responsibilities to the State DOTs, Congress
      requires that a formal written agreement be established between FWHA and each
      State DOT regarding the use of federal funds. The State DOT, acting on behalf
      of FHWA, is expected to exercise judgments similar to FHWA based on Federal
      laws, regulations, and policies. These responsibilities provide assurance that
      approval actions will be performed in accordance with State policies, practices
      and standards and all requirements of federal law.


      Two important characteristics of FHWA Highway Planning and Construction financial
      assistance are that it is both a reimbursable and a matching program. Reimbursable
      means that FHWA pays grantees and subrecipients the actual eligible expenses
      incurred. Money is not provided in advance, so a State DOT or LPA must initially
      finance the project and request reimbursement. A matching program means that
      the Federal funds are matched with State or local resources to cover the total
      project cost. Thus, State DOTs and LPAs are responsible for the accuracy of
      their reimbursement requests in accordance applicable Federal and State requirements.


      In summary, much of the authority for administering the FHWA financial assistance
      falls to the State DOTs, which are responsible for providing oversight and to
      ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements including the accuracy
      of payment requests.'

    Answer: FHWA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (HCF) monitors Financial
      Integrity Review and Evaluation (FIRE) Program findings and recommendations
      to address identified procedures and internal control weaknesses to ensure they
      are addressed by its accessible units (AU). The AUs develop responses for procedural
      and internal control weaknesses based on the various reviews completed for FIRE
      and other program evaluations. HCF monitors the AUs implementation periodically
      and assesses the AUs yearly performance documentation. The HCF monitors the
      AUs progress to ensure timely and effective response actions were completed.

    Answer: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides additional resources for administrative

      administrative expenses funding will be used for information technology investments,
      contractual services, and other investments and services to support the implementation
      and administration. FHWA also requested specific funding for enhancements of
      Fiscal Management Information System (FMIS). Through FMIS, States are reimbursed
      for Federal-aid program costs, able to authorize and modify projects, as well
      as track and report on critical financial and program information.

    Answer: FTA's Transit Infrastructure Grants - COVID Relief Funds are not administered
      at the Federal level and overpayments are outside of FTA control when grant
      recipients make administrative errors. Grant recipients must administer Federal
      transit funds within statutory requirements and in accordance with FTA regulations.
      Grant recipients certify to FTA that they have the ability and intention to
      meet these requirements. Whereas grant recipients are responsible for the administration
      of federal assistance, FTA is responsible, primarily through its regional offices,
      for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and proper use of Federal
      funds.
