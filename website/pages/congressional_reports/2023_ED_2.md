    Answer: To prevent IPs and UPs, FSA will continue to maintain a robust internal
      control framework which includes computer matches performed in FSA systems against
      external sources during the aid delivery process and promoting the IRS Data
      Retrieval Tool (DRT). FSA will also continue to pursue long term corrective
      actions. For example, FSA will continue to work to implement the authorities
      provided in the FUTURE Act to obtain federal tax information data directly from
      the IRS. Obtaining this data will prevent improper payments resulting from the
      applicant misreporting their income on the FAFSA.

    Answer: 'FSA will continue to publish and deliver various free trainings, guidance,
      and resources for school financial aid administrators to target the root causes
      of IPs and UPs and other frequently identified compliance issues. For example,
      FSA will continue to publish updates to questions and answers about verification
      requirements to help clarify verification requirements and reduce the risk of
      verification deficiencies.


      FSA will also continue to annually host the FSA Training Conference and analyze
      the attendance patterns of institutions and their stakeholders, which will allow
      FSA to understand attendance trends and develop training content accordingly.
      FSA will ensure many offices within FSA continue to collectively participate
      to ensure key objects and milestones are met.'

    Answer: Through the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility (SABER) Initiative, FSA
      will continue to implement the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources
      for Education (FUTURE) Act and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
      Simplification Act which ultimately will streamline and strengthen the collection
      of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Implementation
      of the authorities provided in the FUTURE Act will significantly improve data
      authentication by enabling FSA to automatically receive certain federal tax
      information (FTI) from the IRS through a direct-data exchange with applicant
      approval and enabling customers to automatically report their income for the
      total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge post-monitoring, income driven
      repayment (IDR), and FAFSA processes. Implementation of the authorities provided
      in the FAFSA Simplification Act will improve reporting through, for example,
      modifying the questions that students and their families have to answer on the
      FAFSA form and requiring ED to conduct early awareness and outreach of student
      aid eligibility.

    Answer: FSA will also continue to review the annual Single Audit Act compliance
      audits of schools performed by independent auditors to evaluate schools’ administration
      of FSA programs. For deficiencies identified by the auditors, schools are required
      to develop corrective action plans. FSA will continue to review and evaluate
      the effectiveness of schools’ corrective actions and mitigation efforts for
      noted exceptions. When an improper payment is detected and deemed collectable,
      FSA will establish an account receivable and pursue collection.
