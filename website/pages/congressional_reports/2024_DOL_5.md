SurveyData:
- Answer: 'The top root causes of Unemployment Insurance (UI) improper payments for
    Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) 2024 (July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024),
    were: Work Search, Benefit Year Earnings (BYE), and Separation Issues.


    The frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically identity (ID) fraud,
    against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the COVID-19
    pandemic. State UI systems were, and continue to be, targeted by sophisticated
    and organized fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations
    seeking to exploit the UI program for financial gain. A combination of decades
    of underfunding, outdated state UI information technology (IT) systems, record
    claims volumes, and weaker integrity controls in 2020, provided an opportunity
    for criminals to expose vulnerabilities in state UI systems, which resulted in
    elevated rates of improper payments. States have and continue to work tirelessly
    to combat relentless fraud attacks, but the fraud schemes rapidly evolve to circumvent
    prevention and detection tools and strategies implemented by states. ETA continues
    to issue reminders to states about the critical importance of using a multi-layered
    approach to identify and prevent fraud and reduce improper payments.  ETA and
    state UI agencies work collaboratively with the Department’s Office of Inspector
    General (DOL-OIG) and refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and
    misconduct to DOL-OIG for investigation and prosecution.


    The Department places a heightened priority on program integrity and mitigating
    UI fraud risks. ETA remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud
    in the UI programs.  In FY 2024, the Department completely aligned existing UI
    fraud risk management activities with the leading practices provided in the Government
    Accountability Office’s (GAO) Fraud Risk Framework.  Through the development of
    a UI Fraud Risk Profile, the Department further strengthened an organizational
    culture that views the creation, evaluation, monitoring, and evolution of risk
    mitigation strategies as an ongoing process. ETA develops, updates, oversees,
    and communicates UI antifraud strategies through an ever-evolving, robust and
    dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan, that includes innovative strategies and antifraud
    controls to combat emerging fraud schemes and address the highest residual risk
    identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity
    in the UC programs include providing guidance, technical assistance, resources,
    and funding to support states in combatting fraud, strengthening ID verification,
    reducing IPs, recovering overpayments, assessing and addressing fraud risks, protecting
    victims of ID fraud, and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness and equity in
    fraud prevention and detection efforts. The Department continues to explore, research,
    identify, invest in, and provide states with new tools, resources, strategies,
    and guidance to help states combat the continually changing and new emerging types
    of sophisticated fraud impacting the UI system. For more information on the Department’s
    UI antifraud strategies and actions to reduce IPs in unemployment programs, please

- Answer: "With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each\
    \ state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining\
    \ UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment,\
    \ and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments\
    \ for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of\
    \ New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity\
    \ Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases\
    \ such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such\
    \ as tips and leads.\n\nState UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states\
    \ are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing\
    \ recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection\
    \ and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments\
    \ established and recovered.\n\nStates are required to hold claimants liable to\
    \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to\n \nrecover improper\
    \ payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds\
    \ and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must\
    \ be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities. States\
    \ may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity\
    \ and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery\
    \ of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\
    \ Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment\
    \ Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances\
    \ may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.\n\nETA issued\
    \ UIPL No. 11-23 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity\
    \ functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment\
    \ compensation (UC) programs. ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery\
    \ tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such\
    \ actions):\n•\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax\
    \ Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No.\
    \ 13- 20, Change 2);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered\
    \ debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);\n•\t\
    Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\tInterstate\
    \ Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\nETA also\
    \ strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery\
    \ activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment\
    \ recovery operation:\n•\tNegotiating repayment plans;\n•\tAccepting repayments\
    \ through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);\n•\tState Income\
    \ Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage garnishments;\n•\tProperty liens and assessments;\n\
    •\tOffsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;\n•\t\
    Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual\
    \ with an outstanding overpayment;\n•\tSkip tracing;\n•\tWork proactively and\
    \ collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity,\
    \ ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL\
    \ No. 19-21);\n•\tCivil actions;\n•\tCredit bureau referrals;\n•\tState/federal\
    \ prosecution;\n•\tPenalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state\
    \ and federal law;\n•\tCollection agency referrals when state staff is limited,\
    \ or debt is uncollectable by other means;\n•\tImplementing a voluntary fraud\
    \ self-disclosure program; and\n•\tOther recovery methods as determined by state\
    \ law or policy.\n"

- Answer: State UI programs may determine an overpayment to be uncollectable.  In
    most cases this means that all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted
    and the overpayment has been officially written off and/or authorized for removal
    from the active accounts receivable file and transferred to suspense (no further
    action to be taken). However, in cases involving UI identity fraud, when the perpetrator
    of fraud is unknown, a state may also identify the overpayment as “uncollectible”,
    as recovery efforts could not be initiated until the perpetrator of fraud is identified.
    If the perpetrator of fraud is not identified and the state’s law authorizes overpayments
    to be written off, the state is permitted to write-off the overpayment in accordance
    with their state law.  Usually write-offs are applied after the statute of limitations
    expires, bankruptcy has been approved by a court, or the party responsible for
    the overpayment has died.

- Answer: Prior to FY13, OCFO contracted with a recovery audit contractor - however
    that activity was determined not cost effective. This determination was reconfirmed
    in FY24 for all DOL programs identified for payment integrity reporting purposes,
    excepting the Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment
    Insurance program which provides specific reporting via PaymentAccuracy.gov and
    related Cares Act Benefit programs (PUA, FPUC, & PEUC) now expired in law.
