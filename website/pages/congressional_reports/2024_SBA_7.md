- Answer: "Requirement 1a: The OIG found the SBA did not publish payment integrity\
    \ information in its FY 2023 AFR for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF),\
    \ Shuttered Venues Operator Grant (SVOG), and the payments for covered loans in\
    \ the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The\
    \ SBA will be publishing RRF improper payment estimates in FY 2024, has begun\
    \ testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays to estimate\
    \ the rate of improper payments and if budget permits, the SBA expects to have\
    \ the improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY 2025, and\
    \ conducted a qualitative risk assessment to identify the susceptibility of improper\
    \ payments for the Debt Relief Program.\nRequirement 1b: The OIG found the SBA\
    \ did not publish payment integrity information in the AFR or any accompanying\
    \ materials for the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for covered loans in the 7(a)\
    \ and 504 loan guaranty programs under the Debt Relief Program on the agency’s\
    \ website.  The SBA will be publishing RRF improper payment estimates in FY 2024,\
    \ has begun testing a sample population from the SVOG program total program outlays\
    \ to estimate the rate of improper payments and if budget permits, the SBA expects\
    \ to have the improper payment estimates for the SVOG program available in FY\
    \ 2025, and conducted a qualitative risk assessment to identify the susceptibility\
    \ of improper payments for the Debt Relief Program.\nRequirement 3: The OIG found\
    \ the SBA did not implement adequate sampling and estimation methodology plans\
    \ that are statistically acceptable to produce accurate improper and unknown payment\
    \ estimates that are representative of the Disaster Assistance Loans, COVID-Economic\
    \ Injury Disaster Loans (COVID-EIDL), and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency\
    \ Assistance Advance (EIDL Advance) programs.  To remedy this, the OPPCFO team\
    \ met with the program office staff to understand the population reconciliation\
    \ process and perform a population reconciliation, as needed.  In addition to\
    \ that, the SBA is working closely with supporting staff to ensure reconciliations\
    \ are accurate.\nRequirement 4: The OIG found the SBA did not publish corrective\
    \ actions for the payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty\
    \ programs under the Debt Relief Program, the published corrective actions for\
    \ PPP forgiveness and PPP purchases were not effective, and the published corrective\
    \ action plans for the Disaster Assistance Loans program were not effective as\
    \ they did not adequately address the true root cause of improper payments.  The\
    \ SBA established program specific corrective actions to address the root cause\
    \ of improper payments.  \nRequirement 5b: The OIG found the SBA did not demonstrate\
    \ improvements to payment integrity for 7(a) loan guaranty approvals, 7(a) loan\
    \ guaranty purchases, 504 Certified Development loan approvals, Disaster Assistance\
    \ Loans, and COVID-EIDL as the improper payment estimates increased between FYs\
    \ 2022 and 2023.  In FY 2024, the SBA developed tolerable rates for the 7(a) loan\
    \ guaranty approvals, 7(a) loan guaranty purchases, 504 Certified Development\
    \ loan approvals, and Disaster Assistance Loans programs.\nRequirement 6: The\
    \ OIG found the improper and unknown payment rate estimates were not reliable\
    \ or accurate for the Disaster Assistance Loans, COVID-EIDL, EIDL Advance, PPP\
    \ loan forgiveness, and PPP loan guaranty purchases programs and activities. SBA\
    \ also published improper payment and unknown payment rate estimates greater than\
    \ 10 percent for the PPP loan forgiveness and PPP loan guaranty purchases activities.\
    \ Moreover, SBA did not report improper and unknown payment rate estimates for\
    \ the RRF, SVOG, and the payments for covered loans in the 7(a) and 504 loan guaranty\
    \ programs under the Debt Relief Program.  The SBA is working closely with supporting\
    \ staff to ensure the statistical sampling is accurate to estimate an improper\
    \ payment estimate."

- Answer: Improper payments oversight falls under the OPPCFO’s management and the
    internal control program, while improper payment assessments and implementing/maintaining
    successful internal controls is a shared responsibility across OPPCFO and SBA’s
    program offices. As such, within the SBA’s SOPs, there are direct linkages between
    senior management and their responsibilities for maintaining not only an effective
    internal control system, but also complying with laws and regulations. For example,
    under SOP 00 02, Internal Control Systems, management board members (i.e., Senior
    Management Council) and district directors are responsible for maintaining effective
    systems of internal controls. Additionally, under SOP 20 31, Internal Control,
    senior management is responsible for establishing and monitoring, within their
    areas of responsibility, an internal control structure that provides reasonable
    assurance that operations are being run in an efficient and effective manner and
    comply with applicable laws and regulations.  Moreover, all SES-level senior management
    staff also has an enterprise integrity element within their performance plans
    with a benchmark goal to ensure compliance with relevant policies, procedures,
    and controls within their respective organization to effectively identify, prevent,
    monitor, manage and mitigate enterprise and fraud risks; be responsible for prompt
    and responsive participation during any audit (GAO, OIG, and Financial), receiving
    and analyzing draft and final audit reports, providing timely responses to the
    audit organization, and taking corrective action when required while ensuring
    the accuracy of their organization’s information in the SBA Integrity System throughout
    the audit process; and develop and implement robust internal controls as well
    as rigorous improper payment assessments.
