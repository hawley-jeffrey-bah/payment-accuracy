SurveyData:
- Answer: OSC's has 2 Finance staff, and a CFO.  It's spending is largely made up
    of salaries, benefits, and rent, which OSC's tracks closely throughout the fiscal
    year with our HR staff, as well as our payroll provider, NFC.  OSC would require
    additional staff to perform any such audits that are outside of the annual, standard
    financial audit, and any such audits would return negligible results, thus rendering
    them inefficient.
