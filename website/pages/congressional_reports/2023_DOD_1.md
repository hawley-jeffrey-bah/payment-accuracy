  AdditionalInformation: "The Department completed three Payment Integrity Risk Assessments\
    \ in fiscal year (FY) 2023: Military Health Benefits (MHB) – Administrative Costs,\
    \ United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Commercial Pay, and USACE Travel\
    \ Pay Program. The Department determined that each of these programs are not likely\
    \ to have total annual Improper Payments plus Unknown Payments above the statutory\
    \ threshold; and thus, is not susceptible to significant improper payments.\n\n\
    In an ongoing effort to improve Payment Integrity reporting for the MHB program,\
    \ the Department established the “Military Health Benefits – Administrative Costs”\
    \ (Admin) program and submitted the FY 2023 Improper Payment (IP) and Unknown\
    \ Payment (UP) Risk Assessment to the DoD Office of Inspector General on June\
    \ 20, 2023. The MHB – Admin program’s IP and UP Risk Assessment resulted in an\
    \ additional determination to reorganize and restructure the remaining payments\
    \ not covered under administrative costs into groups with similar contractual\
    \ requirements or performance incentives. Specifically, the following new MHB\
    \ Phase 1 programs were created in FY 2023: \n• Military Health Benefits – TRICARE\
    \ East Region Program (East)\n• Military Health Benefits – TRICARE West Region\
    \ Program (West)\n• Military Health Benefits – TRICARE Medicare Eligible Program\
    \ (TMEP)\n• Military Health Benefits – TRICARE Pharmacy Program (TPharm)\n• Military\
    \ Health Benefits – TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP)\n\nThe Department is currently\
    \ performing the new MHB Phase 1 program risk assessments to determine the susceptibility\
    \ to Improper and Unknown Payments. The Department will deliver the completed\
    \ risk assessments on or prior to June 30, 2024."
