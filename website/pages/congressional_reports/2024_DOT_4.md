      documentation and/or payment processes, or address training deficiencies as
      applicable for each improper payment. Corrective actions will include: ensuring
      that all federal regulation requirements are adhered to for physical construction
      projects; confirming federal share amounts have been calculated correctly in
      accordance with contractual terms; confirming that contractual components are
      in place and that invoiced amounts have been calculated correctly in accordance
      with contractual terms; confirming that the receipt of goods or services has
      been verified in accordance with the contract; and validating that services
      were performed and received in accordance with the contract agreement. If applicable,
      FHWA will recover overpayments from the grant recipient.'

    Description_Action_Taken: FHWA compared identified improper payments with prior
      year findings and addressed specific issues with relevant Federal-aid Division
      Offices and grant recipients. If applicable, FHWA recovered overpayments from
      the grant recipient.

    Accountability: 'DOT focuses its accountability mechanisms on the closure of corrective
      actions associated with improper payment remediation plans. DOT''s Deputy Chief
      Financial Officer (DCFO) is the senior accountable official responsible for
      completion of the improper payments-related remediation plans. The DCFO''s performance
      plan contains accountability mechanisms, which include closure of corrective
      actions associated with improper payment remediation plans.


      At the agency-level, FHWA''s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (HCF) administers
      the implementation of the Administration''s PIIA requirements. FHWA develops
      improper payment reduction targets, implements corrective actions and coordinates
      the recapture of improper payments identified during PIIA reviews. In addition
      to the PIIA-related sampling, FHWA conducts additional transaction testing of
      States and territories for improper payments under its Enterprise Financial
      Integrity Review and Evaluation (eFIRE) program. FHWA, through the eFIRE program
      and other risk-based oversight, incorporates additional reviews, including focus
      areas such as inactive projects, grant administration, and procurement under
      the administration of State DOTs using Federal funds. In order to effectively
      hold States and local governments accountable, the Division Office will refuse
      approval for project authorizations that do not meet federal requirements and
      will recover funding that was reimbursed but later determined to be improper.'
    Needs1: At the Federal level, the program has what is needed with respect to internal
      controls, human capital, and information systems to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    Needs2: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides additional resources for administrative
      expenses as takedowns from the Highway Infrastructure Programs (HIP).  FHWA’s
      administrative funding supports salaries and benefits for approximately 2,800
      employees, as well as rent, communications, utilities, contractual services,
      travel, supplies, and equipment to support the delivery of FHWA’s programs.
      The FY 2025 Administrative Expenses request will be used to effectively deliver
      and manage the $71.5 billion requested in the FY 2025 Budget for FHWA’s programs.
    Sufficiency: FHWA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (HCF) monitors Enterprise
      Financial Integrity Review and Evaluation (eFIRE) Program findings and recommendations
      to address identified procedures and internal control weaknesses to ensure they
      are addressed by its accessible units (AU). The AUs develop responses for procedural
      and internal control weaknesses based on the various reviews completed for eFIRE
      and other program evaluations. HCF monitors the AUs implementation periodically
      and assesses the AUs yearly performance documentation. The HCF monitors the
      AUs progress to ensure timely and effective response actions were completed.

    Answer: "The Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Highway Planning and Construction\
      \ program is not administered at the Federal level and overpayments are outside\
      \ of FHWA control when grant recipients make administrative errors. The program\
      \ supports States and Local Public Agencies (LPA) in the design, construction,\
      \ and maintenance of the Nation’s highway system and various federally and tribal\
      \ owned lands. FHWA funds provide the financial resources and mechanism to perform\
      \ these activities. Tax dollars are allocated and distributed by FHWA directly\
      \ to the State DOTs, as a direct-recipient, or LPAs, as sub-recipients, for\
      \ eligible activities. In turn, the State DOTs provide oversight of LPA projects\
      \ and ensure that local agencies that receive and deliver federally funded projects\
      \ comply with Federal and State requirements.\n\nIn recognition of FHWA’s assignment\
      \ of responsibilities to the State DOTs, Congress requires that a formal written\
      \ agreement be established between FWHA and each State DOT regarding the use\
      \ of federal funds. The State DOT is expected to exercise judgments similar\
      \ to FHWA based on Federal laws, regulations, and policies. These responsibilities\
      \ provide assurance that approval actions will be performed in accordance with\
      \ State policies, practices and standards and all requirements of federal law.\n\
      \nTwo important characteristics of FHWA Highway Planning and Construction financial\
      \ assistance are that it is both a reimbursable and a matching program. Reimbursable\
      \ means that FHWA pays grantees and\n \nsubrecipients the actual eligible expenses\
      \ incurred. Money is not provided in advance, so a State DOT or LPA must initially\
      \ finance the project and request reimbursement. A matching program means that\
      \ the Federal funds are matched with State or local resources to cover the total\
      \ project cost. Thus, State DOTs and LPAs are responsible for the accuracy of\
      \ their reimbursement requests in accordance with applicable Federal and State\
      \ requirements.\n\nIn summary, much of the authority for administering the FHWA\
      \ financial assistance falls to the State DOTs, which are responsible for providing\
      \ oversight and to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements including\
      \ the accuracy of payment requests."

    Answer: FHWA identified one technically improper payment in FY 2024. The technically
      improper payment was not made in accordance with all applicable requirements
      since the payment did not comply with the State DOT’s standard specifications
      for road and bridge construction. Specifically, a certification was missing
      two Buy American components even though the right amount was paid to the right
      recipient.

    Needs2: 'The purpose of FTA''s Administrative Expenses budget is to provide resources

      transit grants annually and achieve its strategic mission.


      FTA plans to utilize Transit Formula Grants Oversight funding for the development,
      modernization, and enhancement (DME), and operations and maintenance (O&M) of
