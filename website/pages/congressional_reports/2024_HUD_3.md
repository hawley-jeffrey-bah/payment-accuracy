    Answer: 'During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned
      improvements to establish effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental
      Assistance (TBRA) program. The goal is to prevent and detect improper payments,
      as outlined in the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan. Currently,
      HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO)
      uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification
      (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards,
      income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public
      housing agenciey’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed
      both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD evaluated existing reports
      for estimating improper payment rates but found they did not meet the stringent
      requirements set by the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). Additionally,
      these reports could not generate reliable error estimates with sufficient precision
      to cover the entire payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to
      PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.


      Looking ahead to FY 2025 and beyond, and as funding is available, HUD will continue
      implementing the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and will explore
      testing methods for sub-populations within the TBRA portfolio. By exploring
      other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations,
      HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts
      and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit from
      efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers
      through the following initiatives:


      •The Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) is set to significantly improve
      the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. It will modernize
      how HUD records monthly HCV performance and automate cash management transactions
      as well as financial reporting. eVMS will enhance the accuracy and timeliness
      of housing assistance payments (HAPs), thereby reducing prepaid expenses and
      accounts payables. This will be achieved by using real-time family-level data
      that PHAs submit to HUD via the HUD-50058 through IMS PIC. The system will also
      perform month-to-month reconciliations for retroactive adjustments due to annual
      income certifications or changes in family composition. Moreover, eVMS will
      calculate and track administrative fees across all voucher programs, simplifying
      decision-making for PHAs regarding voucher issuance and other program needs
      by providing daily online views of PHA funding balances. Overall, eVMS will
      automate cash management payments and reconciliations, streamline reporting
      for HUD’s financials, and generate data to test elements within payee and eligibility
      tiers.


      •HUD is also advancing one key project, a beta version of the Enhanced EIV tool,
      which uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to identify income
      trends and changes. The system improvements will strengthen preventative controls
      at the time of initial applications and renewals, with a focus on eligibility.
      The Enhanced EIV tool will help identify income discrepancies during tenant
      applications and renewals, providing PHAs with immediate access to income data
      reported by other partners. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk
      of improper payments resulting from income discrepancies. By leveraging both
      current and historical data alongside predictive analytics, HUD will be able
      to pinpoint trends and forecasts concerning family income. The enhancements
      will eventually expand to involve multiple stakeholders, including all housing
      authorities. The Enhanced EIV tool will offer a comprehensive view across the
      department for all PHAs, ensuring that accurate tenant-level information is
      used for determining Voucher Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) eligibility.
      This holistic perspective will aid in identifying discrepancies between tenant-reported
      income and data from other partners and federal agencies, such as the National
      Database of New Hires from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).


      These initiatives reflect HUD''s commitment to enhancing the integrity and efficiency
      of the TBRA program, ultimately benefiting the communities we serve and demonstrating
      a strong commitment to payment integrity.
