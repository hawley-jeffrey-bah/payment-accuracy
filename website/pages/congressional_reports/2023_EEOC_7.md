- Answer: In a performance agreement for the official, incentives and consequences
    are meant to be aligned with the official's efforts to enhance payment accuracy,
    prevent fraud, and bring the agency into compliance. Incentives may include financial
    rewards, recognition, and access to additional training and development opportunities
    to enhance skills and expertise. Conversely, consequences may include being held
    accountable for any significant lapses in payment integrity due to gross negligence,
    reputational impact which might affect their future career prospects, and legal
    consequences for the agency. Effective performance agreements create a strong
    incentive for the official(s) to diligently work toward improving payment accuracy
    and preventing fraud, as their professional advancement and reputation, as well
    as the reputation of the agency, are directly affected by their ability to meet
    these goals.
