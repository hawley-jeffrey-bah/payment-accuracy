    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023, we released several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve the system.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are developing the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) Product.  The
      CDR Product is a project to streamline the continuing disability review process,
      increase efficiencies, and reduce improper payments for work CDRs.  The multifaceted
      product is comprised of four separate workstreams, across several component
      business and systems sponsors.  In addition to work CDRs, the Product aims to
      modernize the medical CDR process with the addition of online service options
      and reduce paper case processing by automating current Electronic Disability
      Collect System exclusions.  In February 2023, CDR product released the i454
      which allows adult beneficiaries with an online option to file the SSA-454 or
      a Medical CDR Report.  When the customer uses this online version, the technician''s
      process is streamlined and allows for quicker processing.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2024, we plan to release Multiple Pending Claim functionality to the Electronic
      Disability Collect System (EDCS) that will reduce the reliance on paper processing.
      and plan to make the eWork system Multi-Factor Authentication compliant.  We
      are currently beginning the development of a  modernized version of eWork which
      will eventually be integrated into the existing EDCS application and will make
      EDCS available for field office technicians.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed processes using UIPath software.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021,
      we pursued a contract with UIPath software, to create automated “robotic” programs
      that will perform routine or repetitive tasks.  Robotic Processing Automation
      (RPA), or “BOTs,” are available to Processing Center technicians to assist with
      processing manual awards or post-entitlement actions.  Since January 2021, six
      BOTs have been created and placed into production.  Use of the BOTs reduces
      keystrokes and manual coding and detects exceptions and alerts before they occur.  In
      FY 2024, we plan to enhance the existing RPA scripts and begin development and
      implementation of a series of BOTs that will automate computations and input
      of complex and error prone windfall offset payments.  We are making a long-term
      investment in robotics technology using the software to improve business processes
      and eliminate manual actions.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to the all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

      beneficiaries whose earnings put them at risk for being overpaid.  We created
      the WorkSmart project to reduce and prevent Improper Payments and complete work
      Continuing Disability Reviews more efficiently by identifying earnings earlier,
      identifying cases that have earnings above substantial gainful activity (SGA)
      and are still receiving benefits, and prioritizing cases that are most likely
      to end in an SGA cessation.  This helps prevent beneficiaries from building
      overpayment debts.

      Insurance beneficiaries about their reporting responsibilities.  Section 826
      of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required the Commissioner to establish
      and implement a system permitting DI beneficiaries to report their earnings
      electronically.  Our myWageReport (myWR) online application, allows DI beneficiaries,
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients, concurrent beneficiaries, and
      representative payees to report wages and view, print, or save a receipt.  DI
      self-reporters and their representative payees can report wages that occurred
      within a two-year timeframe from the reporting date.  We promote use of our
      online wage reporting application, myWageReport (myWR), on social media with
      training videos depicting three reporting options:  my Social Security, SSA
      Mobile Wage Reporting, and SSI Telephone Wage Reporting.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we are working to simplifying our notices.  Although we made efforts
      to simplify notices, some of our notices and communications can be complex,
      lengthy, and difficult to comprehend.  The difficulty can sometimes result from
      the complexity of our programs and legal requirements to communicate certain
      information.  We will sample notices and other communications and assess the
      quality and understandability of our communications.  We will inform and remind
      beneficiaries about reporting responsibilities.'

    Description_Action_Taken: To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we developed a Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)
      and Government Pension Offset (GPO) Corrective Action Plan.  We developed a
      comprehensive corrective action plan to address multiple underlying causes of
      WEP and GPO improper payments.  We formed a cross agency work group to review
      all Office of the Inspector General and internal studies to compile a comprehensive
      list of recommended changes in WEP and GPO implementation.  We assessed the
      root causes of improper payments based on these changes and developed policy,
      data, systems, and training solutions in line with each of the root causes of
      improper payments.  We developed a logic model framework to measure the effectiveness
      of completed corrective action that includes establishing benchmarks to evaluate
      the corrective actions, assessing the impact, if possible, and determining whether
      additional mitigation activities are necessary.  Since FY 2017, there has been
      a significant reduction in improper payments related to WEP and GPO.  In July
      2023, the WEP/GPO calculator was added to the redesigned SSA.gov website.  However,
      we continue to assert that the complexity of our program makes it extremely
      challenging to isolate the effects of a particular corrective action.

      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical

      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed a data exchange for the Federal Employment Compensation
      Act Data.  The Federal Employment Compensation Act (FECA) workers’ compensation
      program, which is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), provides coverage
      to three million Federal and Postal workers.  Receipt of FECA benefits can offset
      Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits.  SSA and DOL have agreed
      to move forward with our request for DOL FECA data.  We are working to finalize

      Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for higher Supplemental
      Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  From March to August
      2020, SSI applications decreased by 30 percent when compared to prior years.  We
      analyzed a range of beneficiary characteristics to determine if any groups were
      disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We identified a population
      of 1.4 million individuals who are currently receiving OASDI benefits that are
      less than the SSI federal benefit rate.  Based on these findings, we mailed
      approximately 200,000 letters to beneficiaries potentially eligible for SSI,
      with a focus on the aged and limited English proficiency population.  The preliminary
      mailing occurred December 2020–March 2021.  We released the remaining 1.2 million

      increased call months, and resumed the issuance of mailers from April 2022–December
      2022.  Beneficiaries who had an email registered with the agency also received
      an email.  In October 2022, we mailed out more than 19,000 notices to beneficiaries
      receiving spousal benefits who may have sufficient earnings to be eligible for
      higher retirement benefits based on their own earnings.  In December 2022, we
      issued a reminder to field office and payment center technicians on proper development
      of the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset.  In April
      2023, we mailed out almost 38,000 notices to surviving spouses who are potentially

    Answer: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments within the agency’s
      control are caused by our failure to access data or information needed.  These
      overpayments occur when we have access to the data or information we need to
      accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information
      provided to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The leading
      cause of the overpayment was our failure to timely update records with reported
      changes or take appropriate action.  An incorrect action could be due to a mathematical
      error, typographical error, incorrect policy interpretation, or delay in input.  To
      prevent these overpayments from occurring, we provide training and reminders
      for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy
      when possible.

    Answer: Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance overpayments outside the
      agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to calculate
      a payment because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide the
      requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute
      the accurate benefit amount.  It occurs because of beneficiaries’ or representative
      payees’ failure to report changes.  For this reporting period, the leading cause
      of overpayments outside the agency’s control was the failure to report changes
      in marital status timely (i.e. marriage, divorce, or remarriage).

    Answer: 'We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure
      stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We
      monitor the status of corrective actions through monthly meetings and quarterly
      senior executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed
      a comprehensive approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives
      that target the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts
      serve to prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The
      purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that
      will have the most significant impact to the detection and prevention of improper
      payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments,
      we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally
      responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.


      In fiscal year 2023, we completed evaluations on three of the Improper Payments
      Alignment Strategies.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore cost-effective
      corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we continue to note
      that the complexity of our Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability program makes
      it extremely difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular
      corrective action.'

    Answer: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that
      has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
      existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
      assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and
      operating effectively.


      As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
      management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
      Act.


      We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
      membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
      clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


      Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent
      on having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our
      employees who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for
      benefits and other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is
      critical to maintain a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship
      work.


      Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
      to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
      investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
      digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and
      mobile accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital
      services that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers
      to service to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and
      employees.  We are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service
      while reducing manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient
      funding is necessary to continue to modernize our IT.


      Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
      information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
      to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
      controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
      and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
      a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on
      continuous improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support
      of Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of
      Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward
      Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our
      digital identity processes to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined
      Electronic Services for Constituents Act.


      Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
      network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
      cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
      partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
      flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.'

      established the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper
      payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access
      the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed,
      we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We
      are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:


      Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February
      2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food
      assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition
      of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.


      Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October
      2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment
      of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of
      the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need
      their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental
      Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.


      Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM
      published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception
      in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM
      if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In
      April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified
      SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the
      SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the
      existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten
      the application process for SSI disability applicants.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023 there were several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct
      software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.

      Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries who are potentially entitled for higher Supplemental
      Security Income (SSI) payments than their OASDI benefit.  From March to August
      2020, SSI applications decreased by 30 percent when compared to prior years.  We
      analyzed a range of beneficiary characteristics to determine if any groups were
      disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We identified a population
      of 1.4 million individuals who are currently receiving OASDI benefits that are
      less than the SSI federal benefit rate.  Based on these findings, we mailed
      approximately 200,000 letters to beneficiaries potentially eligible for SSI,
      with a focus on the aged and limited English proficiency populations.  The preliminary
      mailing occurred December 2020–March 2021.  We released the remaining 1.2 million

      AFI is to identify excess resources in financial accounts, which are a leading
      cause of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program
      uses an electronic process with participating financial institutions to verify
      bank account balances and detect undisclosed accounts in up to 10 nearby banks.  We
      will be evaluating the benefit to running AFI between the SSI initial application
      and subsequent eligibility redeterminations, based on an Office of the Inspector
      General recommendation.  In March 2023, we released Policy in Focus training
      and issued a frontline broadcast to remind technicians of AFI and SSI financial
      accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account
      Verification Reminders and issued a frontline broadcast to ensure that technicians
      are reviewing the financial account pages in the SSI claims path for accuracy
      before adjudicating an event.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information

      our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States
      Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the
      expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  For FY
      2023 we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These
      data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child''s foster placement
      has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding
      this exchange.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information

      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical
      State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and
      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist

      of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the United States
      Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
      program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an
      address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically
      posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion
      to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  Based on NCOA data analysis,
      we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility
      of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating the notices to inform SSI
      recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding
      their living situation.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist,
      inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data
      or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages,
      we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an information exchange
      with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan
      Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We
      have completed several phases of pre-implementation development and are drafting
      a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations for the PIE process.  We
      will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after the final rule (regulation)

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Our Agency Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022-2026
      established the goal to improve access to our programs.  To address improper
      payments caused by data or information needed does not exist, inability to access
      the data or information needed, and failure to access data or information needed,
      we are proposing changes to how in-kind support and maintenance (ISM) is calculated.  We
      are working on three regulatory changes to help simplify ISM policies, including:


      Omitting food from ISM (Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published February
      2023).  The proposed rule would remove food as a source of ISM, so that food
      assistance received from others does not impact claimants’ benefit eligibility
      and amounts.  We also proposed to add conforming language to our definition
      of income, excluding food from the ISM calculation.


      Expanding the definition of a Public Assistance Household (NPRM published October
      2023).  The proposed rule would add the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      to the definition of Public Income Maintenance Payments considered for treatment
      of a public assistance household; if every household member receives one of
      the specified types of assistance, we assume that other household members need
      their income to support their own needs and do not subject the Supplemental
      Security Income claimant to ISM or deeming.


      Expanding the Rental Subsidy Policy for SSI Applicants and Recipients (NPRM
      published August 2023).  The proposed rule would expand a rental subsidy exception
      in effect in seven States to the whole nation, exempting claimants from ISM
      if they pay at least one third of their SSI benefit on rent.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Simplification Workgroup.  In
      April 2021, the agency convened the SSI Simplification Workgroup to address
      concerns regarding the complexity of our paper SSI application form, SSA-8000.  The
      workgroup, consisting of cross-component subject matter experts, is a collaborative
      effort to shorten and simplify the form.  Our goal is to develop a fully online-simplified
      SSI application process.  The first step is to implement, in late 2023, the
      SSI Simplification Phase I initiative, or iSSI.  iSSI will be a pathway in the
      existing Social Security internet Claim System that will streamline and shorten
      the application process for SSI disability applicants.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by inability to
      access the data or information needed, we created a new form, SSA-186, Temporary
      Institutionalization Statement to Maintain Household and Physician Certification.  This
      form allows recipients to report their statement of need to maintain household
      expenses and to obtain the physician’s certification.  This meets two of the
      five requirements needed for a recipient to be eligible for temporary institutionalization
      benefits.  We have been informed by advocates that both requirements can be
      challenging for recipients to report and obtain.  In an effort to simplify the
      process, we have created this form to collect the information.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed and failure to access data or information needed, we developed Access
      to Financial Institutions (AFI).  The purpose of AFI is to identify excess resources
      in financial accounts, which are a leading cause of Supplemental Security Income
      (SSI) payment errors.  The AFI program uses an electronic process with participating
      financial institutions to verify bank account balances and detect undisclosed
      accounts in up to 10 nearby banks.  We will be evaluating the benefit to running
      AFI between the SSI initial application and subsequent eligibility redeterminations,
      based on an Office of the Inspector General recommendation.  In March 2023,
      we released Policy in Focus training and issued a frontline broadcast to remind
      technicians of AFI and SSI financial accounts policy.  In August 2023, we published
      AM-23048 - SSI Financial Account Verification Reminders and issued a frontline
      broadcast to ensure that technicians are reviewing the financial account pages
      in the SSI claims path for accuracy before adjudicating an event.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we will pursue new data exchange partners from government and private
      sectors in collaboration with our agency business sponsors.  We plan to expand
      our outreach efforts with the Data Exchange Community of Practice and the States
      Data Exchange Community of Interest, to engage more agencies and broaden the
      expansion of best practices toward streamlining the exchange of data.  For FY
      2023 we implemented two new incoming data exchanges with State foster care agencies.  These
      data exchanges assist in avoiding improper payments when a child''s foster placement
      has changed.  We continue to engage State agencies for the purpose of expanding
      this exchange.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we are improving our death data processing.  We collect data from a
      variety of sources so that we can administer our programs.  We plan to continue
      making progress in centralizing our death inputs, improving the quality and
      processing of death data, and updating historical death records in our databases.  In
      November 2022, for processing death reports, we issued a reminder to technicians
      on which records to review and how to determine if we already have proof of
      death.  The reminder also instructs technicians to monitor payment records after
      entering a date of death.  To improve the completeness of our death information,
      we are in the early stages of contracting with the National Association for
      Public Health Statistics and Information Systems on the acquisition of historical
      State death records.  This effort will increase the accuracy, integrity, and
      completeness of our death data.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist
      and failure to access data or information needed, we have a National Change
      of Address (NCOA) contract and data exchange agreement with the United States
      Postal Service (USPS) for the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)
      program.  We are electronically notified when an OASDI beneficiary reports an
      address change to the USPS and in most cases, the new address information automatically
      posts to our records.  We are determining the feasibility of the NCOA expansion
      to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  Based on NCOA data analysis,
      we are updating the existing NCOA process before continuing to explore the feasibility
      of expansion to the SSI program.  We are updating the notices to inform SSI
      recipients to contact us because we may need additional information regarding
      their living situation.


      To address improper payments caused by data or information needed does not exist,
      inability to access the data or information needed, and failure to access data
      or information needed, and to reduce the reliance on self-reporting of wages,
      we are developing new wage reporting tools, such as an information exchange
      with commercial payroll data providers authorized by section 824 of the Bipartisan
      Budget Act of 2015, now referred to as the Payroll Information Exchange (PIE).  We
      have completed several phases of pre-implementation development and are drafting
      a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with our regulations for the PIE process.  We
      will conduct the exchange and automate PIE data after the final rule (regulation)
      is established.  We will perform ongoing assessments while working towards full
      implementation.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'To address improper payments caused by failure to access
      data or information needed, we are developing a Consolidated Claims Experience
      (CCE) application.  CCE will be a single-entry point for employees to process
      all agency benefits.  CCE includes eligibility screening, initial claims intake
      processing, and post-entitlement activities.  CCE will automate more computations,
      reduce manual actions, assist in the identification of potential or missed entitlements,
      and include dynamic pathing and policy references within the application.  Currently,
      only Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available in CCE with additional
      claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Title 18)
      to be added in future releases.  In fiscal year (FY) 2023 there were several
      CCE updates in the SSI program to improve CCE software performance, correct
      software problems, and respond to employee feedback.  In FY 2024, we will release
      several additional CCE enhancements in the SSI program and continue efforts
      to expand on additional claim types (i.e., Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability
      Insurance and Medicare) for future increments.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we implemented several outreach initiatives to reach communities facing
      barriers to accessing our programs and assist individuals interested in filing
      for Supplemental Security Income and other potential benefits.  The online protective
      filing tool is a public-facing web tool to submit a request for an appointment
      to file for benefits and record a protective filing date.  The tool prevents
      underpayments by making it easier for applicants to file for benefits.  In March
      2023, we began releasing mailers targeted to households within underserved zip
      codes.  The mailers were sent weekly through September 2023 in batches of about
      100,000 in both English and Spanish.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access the data or information
      needed, we developed the SSA Mobile Wage Reporting App.  Supplemental Security
      Income recipients, deemors, and representative payees may use the SSA Mobile
      Wage Reporting App (downloaded at no cost from Google Play and Apple App) to
      report wages and ensure payment accuracy.  We enhanced the application to offer
      a more secure method of authentication for application users.  We implemented
      multi-factor authentication in September 2023.


      To address improper payments caused by failure to access data or information
      needed, we developed the Technician Experience Dashboard (TED).  TED is our
      enterprise customer relationship management solution that will provide a single
      location for information about our customers’ interactions with the agency to
      make it easier for our employees to help the public and increases efficiency
      and accuracy, improving the overall customer experience.  In fiscal year (FY)
      2023, TED added Registration and Customer Support, Upload Document workflows,
      and made general improvements to the application.  In June 2023, TED became
      available for use in the Boston region.  We plan to expand TED to the remaining
      regions in FY 2024.


      To address improper payments caused by inability to access data or information
      needed, we developed a tool to submit and sign documents electronically.  In
      July 2023, we released the Upload Documents service into production and in September
      2023 we added the electronic signature feature, which addresses the Executive
      Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild
      Trust in Government.  We plan to expand Upload Documents to all field offices
      in fiscal year 2024 and will continue to expand the types of documents that
      can be uploaded and signed electronically.'

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: SSA
    Answer: Supplemental Security Income overpayments within the agency’s control
      are caused by our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments
      occur when the agency was aware of information that caused an overpayment but
      failed to take action or took incorrect action when a recipient or a third party
      provided requested information necessary to compute the accurate payment amount.  An
      incorrect action could be due to a mathematical error, typographical error,
      incorrect policy interpretation, or delay in input.  Failure to take action
      could occur when a recipient or third-party reports a change and we fail to
      make the change.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, we provide training
      and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve
      accuracy when possible.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: SSA
    Answer: 'Supplemental Security Income (SSI) overpayments outside the agency’s
      control occur when the data or information needed does not exist and because
      of our inability to access data or information needed.  For the root cause data
      or information needed does not exist, overpayments occur because there is no
      database or dataset that currently exists where we can check eligibility prior
      to making the payment.  For example, the law requires us to evaluate an individual’s
      income, which includes support and maintenance provided in kind.  This type
      of income is difficult to accurately value because it can fluctuate each month
      as household expenses, composition, and the type of assistance provided may
      change.  Additionally, there is no database or data source we can use to verify
      these factors.  We rely on recipients to report changes in household expenses,
      composition, and contributions accurately and timely.


      For the root cause inability to access data, overpayments occur when recipients
      (or their representative payees on their behalf) fail to timely report changes
      in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or
      a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of
      both overpayments and underpayments.  Although we explicitly inform all individuals
      of their reporting requirements during the application process and within every
      award letter, pamphlets periodically sent to recipients, and standard language
      in most official agency correspondence, recipients and representative payees
      may fail to report or may not report changes in time to prevent an improper
      payment.


      SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources
      who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated
      by the statutory requirement to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI
      payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month
      for eligibility in that month.  Many factors influence SSI payment accuracy.  Even
      if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect
      the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus,
      the program requirements themselves sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  We
      remain committed to simplifying the SSI program, and we are exploring ways to
      do this in an equitable manner.

    Answer: 'We remain focused on our strategic objectives and agency goals to ensure
      stewardship and improve program integrity by reducing improper payments.  We
      monitor the status of corrective actions through monthly meetings and quarterly
      senior executive meetings.  We evaluated existing initiatives and developed
      a comprehensive approach to identify and support new and planned reduction initiatives
      that target the root causes of leading causes of improper payments.  These efforts
      serve to prioritize and drive business process, policy, and automation improvements.  The
      purpose of this effort is to strategically align agency wide initiatives that
      will have the most significant impact on the detection and prevention of improper
      payments.  By identifying and analyzing the root causes of the improper payments,
      we channel our efforts in the most efficient manner ensuring that we are fiscally
      responsible as we implement a corrective action plan.


      In fiscal year 2023, we completed evaluations on three of our Improper Payments
      Alignment Strategies.  We will continue to find opportunities to explore cost-effective
      corrective action plans based on our evaluations.  However, we continue to note
      that the complexity of our Supplemental Security Income program makes it extremely
      difficult to determine the dollar value associated with a particular corrective
      action.

    Answer: 'Internal Controls:  We have a strong internal control environment that
      has always included controls over our benefit payment and debt management processes.  Our
      existing internal control environment and assurance processes provide reasonable
      assurance that our internal controls over improper payments are in place and
      operating effectively.


      As part of our internal control environment, we have a well-established, agency-wide
      management control program as required by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity
      Act.


      We established the Improper Payments Oversight Board, consisting of senior executive
      membership, to ensure that we are focusing on improper payment prevention, formulating
      clear and innovative strategies, and driving timely results agency-wide.


      Human Capital:  Our program integrity work is labor-intensive and dependent
      on having the necessary trained staff to do the work.  For the most part, our
      employees who handle our program integrity work also handle applications for
      benefits and other mission-critical work.  Sustained, sufficient funding is
      critical to maintain a workforce size necessary to balance our service and stewardship
      work.


      Information Systems:  Our staff rely on our information technology (IT) infrastructure
      to serve the public and safeguard our programs.  Our technology modernization
      investments focus on simple, seamless, and secure service by delivering customer-centric
      digital capabilities with human-centered design, business intelligence, and
      mobile accessible platforms.  We plan on continuing to implement new digital
      services that focus on enhancing the customer experience and removing barriers
      to service to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, partners, and
      employees.  We are prioritizing self-service options to improve customer service
      while reducing manual work completed by frontline staff.  Sustained, sufficient
      funding is necessary to continue to modernize our IT.


      Other Infrastructure:  Cybersecurity is vital to protecting the personally identifiable
      information of everyone we serve.  Maintaining the public’s trust in our ability
      to protect sensitive data housed in our systems requires advanced cybersecurity
      controls, constant assessment of the threat landscape, and continual improvements
      and enhancements of our cybersecurity program.  Our cybersecurity program uses
      a risk-based approach to balance protection and productivity and focuses on
      continuous improvement.  We are expanding our cybersecurity program in support
      of Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and Office of
      Management and Budget Memorandum 22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero
      Trust Cybersecurity Principles.  In addition, we are strengthening our digital
      identity processes to comply with the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic
      Services for Constituents Act.


      Our cybersecurity efforts help us to maintain our vigilance and protect against
      network intrusions and improper access of data by strengthening our defensive
      cyber capabilities, sharing cyber threat information with our Federal and industry
      partners, and moving toward a Zero Trust Architecture that focuses on the secure
      flow of information from the network perimeter across the enterprise.

    Answer: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget included resources for internal
      controls to maintain our level of improper payments.  As part of our stewardship
      responsibilities and our efforts to reduce improper payments, we also requested
      funding for program integrity activities.  Many of the tools we use, such as
      our medical Continuing Disability Reviews, Supplemental Security Income redeterminations,
      and the Cooperative Disability Investigations program, save billions of program
      dollars with a proportionally small investment of administrative resources.
