- Answer: "Salaries and Expenses\nAdministrative Offices - Other Contractual Services\
    \ \nProgram Offices - Other Contractual Services\nThe Office of the Chief Human\
    \ Capital Officer (OCHCO) Administrative and Budget Services manages Transit Subsidy\
    \ payments. \nFor the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), OCHCO\
    \ reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their\
    \ certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous\
    \ payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes\
    \ the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates\
    \ with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC)\
    \ to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made.\
    \ Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines\
    \ if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality\
    \ review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and\
    \ corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee\
    \ is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is\
    \ initiated.\nAlso, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review\
    \ based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting\
    \ Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used\
    \ to determine if there are any incorrect coverage plans, personnel data or duty\
    \ locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History\
    \ Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which\
    \ will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods.\
    \ Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed\
    \ and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing\
    \ System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an\
    \ opportunity to setup a payment plan.\nThe Office of the Chief Financial Officer\
    \ (OCFO) provides assistance and advice to HUD program budget offices on improper\
    \ payroll payments and payroll corrections on an ad-hoc basis and upon request.\
    \ For other than payroll payments such as travel payments, purchase card payments,\
    \ contract payments, and Interagency Agreement (IAA) payments, program offices\
    \ follow the Administrative Control of Funds Policies (Administrative Control\
    \ of Funds Policies, 1830.2 REV-6) to ensure improper payments are prevented or\
    \ detected and corrected and OCFO-Budget provides assistance to budget offices\
    \ upon request. Reports run from HUD’s Financial System (Oracle Business Intelligence/OBI)\
    \ suite of reports to include the Procurement Request Information System Management\
    \ (PRISM) and Travel reports, and other payment systems (e.g., Invoice Processing\
    \ Platform (IPP), Intra.gov, Concur), are used to identify, and sometimes, recover\
    \ improper non-payroll Salaries and Expenses (S&E) payments. Most program offices\
    \ have designated individuals to run and review payment reports for discrepancies\
    \ and improper payments including unauthorized purchases in line with departmental\
    \ and program office funds control policies. Additionally, program office Contracting\
    \ Officer Representatives (CORs) ensure invoice payments are proper and made in\
    \ line with contract guidelines through the use of reports ran through IPP and\
    \ related OBI reports.\nAs part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget\
    \ runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll\
    \ corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request\
    \ and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of\
    \ improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll\
    \ reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections\
    \ to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC.\nAdditionally, program Budget\
    \ office’s work with ARC, HUD OCFO, and HUD’s OCPO HUD CPO in the payment recapture\
    \ process as it relates to non-payroll S&E improper payments. For example, program\
    \ budget office’s work with OCFO’s travel management staff on the recapture of\
    \ improper payments.\nThe Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines\
    \ procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can\
    \ lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.\n\
    \nLead Hazard Reduction\nDuring grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control\
    \ and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting\
    \ documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical\
    \ Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with\
    \ documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory,\
    \ grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment,\
    \ a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal,\
    \ if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts),\
    \ as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and\
    \ the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would\
    \ be referred to the OGC for action. \nDuring the close-out of a grant, if it\
    \ is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide\
    \ an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits\
    \ a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a\
    \ letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. \n\
    In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation\
    \ with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents\
    \ the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s\
    \ process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The\
    \ likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH\
    \ is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have\
    \ already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees\
    \ submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using\
    \ the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting\
    \ documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request\
    \ Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all\
    \ totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to\
    \ ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after\
    \ a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee.\
    \ Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During\
    \ grant execution, the OLHCHH reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting\
    \ documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the GTR or the COR, as\
    \ applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination\
    \ of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual\
    \ basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a\
    \ due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division\
    \ Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the\
    \ request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did\
    \ not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for\
    \ action. \nDuring the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial\
    \ error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem\
    \ and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial\
    \ shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget\
    \ Officer for the recapturing of funds. \nIn addition, the GTR includes a copy\
    \ of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the\
    \ Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044\
    \ (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and\
    \ monitoring for reimbursable funding. The risks of improper reimbursements are\
    \ low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed\
    \ are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally,\
    \ every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide\
    \ a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part\

    \ performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted\
    \ once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined\

    \ Notes\nMulti-Family Property\nSingle Family Claims\nSingle Family Property\n\
    Title I Notes\nTitle I Claims\nOther Disbursements\nThe Office of Housing-Federal\
    \ Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall\
    \ program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies\
    \ and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes,\
    \ and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering\
    \ improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that\
    \ identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched,\
    \ and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of\
    \ the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed,\
    \ and post claim reviews are performed. \nUnder Title I and Other Debt Collection\
    \ Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily\
    \ responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including\
    \ responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises,\
    \ disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies\
    \ of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded\
    \ lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports,\
    \ correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.\
    \ \nThe Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used\
    \ to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically\
    \ send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s\
    \ Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and\
    \ administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program\
    \ (TOP) and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that\
    \ case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand\
    \ letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP\
    \ offset. \nFor internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur\
    \ when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing\
    \ letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables\
    \ using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established\
    \ in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is\
    \ further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate\
    \ fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The\
    \ Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified\
    \ in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated\
    \ by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted\
    \ to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort\
    \ year. \nIf a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable\
    \ is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the\
    \ receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days,\
    \ it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At\
    \ that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged\
    \ delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the\
    \ notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery. \nAnother avenue\
    \ by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for\
    \ title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims\
    \ is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements.\
    \ A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees\
    \ can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report\
    \ is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s\
    \ issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies\
    \ them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report,\
    \ it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it\
    \ until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily\
    \ Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender. If the lender fails\
    \ to respond to their demands, the debt is referred to the FOC for collection.\
    \ Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed\
    \ by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt\
    \ Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible\
    \ delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is\
    \ 120 days delinquent. \nThe Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report\
    \ delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement\
    \ data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After\
    \ referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting\
    \ the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing\
    \ is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection\
    \ agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal\
    \ Agencies. \nThe FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and\
    \ issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues\
    \ a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs\
    \ the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information\
    \ to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also\
    \ automatically assessed if warranted. \nIf the debt remains unpaid, it is referred\
    \ to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for\
    \ direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection\
    \ agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ)\
    \ for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG)\
    \ action if they deem such action to be appropriate. \nIf Treasury’s Cross-Servicing\
    \ action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than\
    \ two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently\
    \ not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful\
    \ or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise,\
    \ the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues\
    \ an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate.\
    \ Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any\
    \ point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor\
    \ is discharged as bankrupt). \nCollections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury\
    \ Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come\
    \ to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection\
    \ (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS."
