    Description_Action_Taken: "Employment and Training Administration (ETA) continued\
      \ to support expansion and updates to the State Information Data Exchange System\
      \ (SIDES). State Information Data Exchange System was developed through the\
      \ collaborative efforts of state UI agencies, the National Association of State\
      \ Workforce Agencies (NASWA), ETA, and employers to enable the electronic communication\
      \ of job separation information and other Unemployment Insurance information\
      \ between employers and state Unemployment Insurance agencies. The system improves\
      \ the timeliness and quality of job separation information from employers, thus\
      \ reducing the number of improper payments to claimants who are determined to\
      \ be ineligible for Unemployment Insurance due to disqualifying job separations,\
      \ such as quitting without good cause or discharged for misconduct. National\
      \ Association of State Workforce Agencies operates State Information Data Exchange\
      \ System on behalf of the participating states. Employment and Training Administration\
      \ encourages states to view State Information Data Exchange System as a critical\
      \ part of their Unemployment Insurance integrity efforts and to connect to all\
      \ State Information Data Exchange System exchanges. In FY 2023, the following\

    Answer: 'The state agency identified an issue but did not properly follow procedures
      or complete required forms and/or provided incorrect information or did not
      resolve the issue(s). Alternatively, the issue could have been the result of
      a third-party error/incorrect information.


      In addition, these issues may involve instances where the state agency was resolving
      the error or had detected the error as a result of a crossmatch with National
      Directory of New Hire (NDNH) or wage records and an issue was detected after
      the payment was issued.


      State agencies operate the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. Thus, overpayments
      originate from state agency administration issues and are not within the Federal
      agency’s control. Responses to questions referring to activities “within the
      agency’s control” reflect matters within state agencies’ control.'

    Answer: 'The UI program is a unique federal-state partnership based on Federal
      law but administered through individual state laws by 53 state UI agencies.
      States vary in their information technology systems, level of automation, staffing
      capacity, and methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and recovery
      of improper payments and fraud. Additionally, no two states'' written laws,
      regulations, and policies specifying eligibility conditions are identical, and
      differences in these conditions influence the potential for error and improper
      payments. Two states could have identical laws but may interpret them quite
      differently. States with stringent or complex provisions tend to have higher
      improper payment rates than

      those with simpler, more straightforward provisions.


      Furthermore, Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act requires UI payments
      to be made “when due” and, once a person is determined eligible, this law  prohibits
      states from suspending payments until an official determination has been made
      that payments are no longer due. This statutory factor requires states to make
      payments that may later be determined as improper as a result of obtaining new
      information. For good policy reasons, states must continue paying benefits until
      due process occurs (notice and an opportunity for a hearing is provided before
      benefit payments are stopped). This UI program structural feature is a primary
      driver for top root causes of UI improper payments.'

    Answer: Unknown payments were caused due to insufficient staff due to retirement,
      staff turnover, and lack of experienced staff to complete investigations. In

    Answer: ETA has not determined a tolerable rate. Setting a tolerable rate will
      need to take the states' operations into account. The National overpayment,
      unknown, and underpayment rates (improper payments) are driven on the processes
      and performance of the states. During the pandemic, states transitioned experienced
      staff from their normal duties to assist with the unprecedented claims volume
      to operate the regular UI programs as well as implementing and administering
      the temporary pandemic programs authorized by the CARES act. Other factors that
      prevented states from reducing improper payments include such factors such as
      outdated IT systems, loss of experienced staff, new inexperience staff, and
      the reduction of administrative funding, which significantly impacted resources
      and staffing level.

    Answer: State agencies were responsible for processing applications for PUA compensation
      according to federal law and guidance. Part of this process involves a determination
      of whether the applicant has eligibility for unemployment benefits under another
      program and verification of the identity of the applicant, as well as the information
      provided by the applicant at the time of application through the continued claim
      process. To do this, state agencies utilize several tools and workflows such
      as wage/earnings crossmatches, investigation of inconsistencies, obtaining and
      maintaining claims documentation, or ensuring compliance with state law. These
      tools and/or functions are exclusively available to state agencies for use throughout
      the life of a claim. Therefore, inadequate use of these options/functions is
      within the control of the state agency.

    Answer: These payments are unknown since their accuracy could not be definitively
      established or refuted. For the PUA program, payment accuracy assessments were
      made by state Reviewers who were tasked with reviewing sampled PUA cases. However,
      in some of these cases, they could not carry out a full review since the information
      to determine payment accuracy was either unavailable or not sufficient to make
      a determination on the accuracy of the payment.

    Answer: 'PUA is a temporary program that ended by law in September 2021. A contributing
      cause of the improper and unknown payments calculated for the reporting period
      for the program was the result of a number of states failing to perform or document
      performance of key data cross-matches. Training was identified as one of the
      actions taken to address improper and unknown payments. Through training opportunities
      such as ETA webinars that discussed its guidance, training and instructions
      on using tools like the Integrity Data Hub and various crossmatches, as well
      as individual technical assistance from regional offices, states were able to
      improve identity verification activity. This improvement directly impacts a
      state’s ability to ensure the social security numbers used in the UI claims
      process by UI applicants, in fact belong to these applicants. In doing so, states
      are able to reduce improper and unknown payments.

      Additionally, the use of cross enterprise sharing helps states to gain access
      to a more comprehensive pool of data that can assist as they attempt to verify
      the identity to UI applicants in various categories such as, across agencies
      or across states. This kind of access broadens the reach of the state verification
      process and can help in its efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments
      due to identity.

    Answer: Beneficiaries who are totally disabled and receive period-roll payments,
      are required to submit medical document to support ongoing disability from work.
      If a beneficiary fails to submit requested medical reports, or the medical evidence
      shows the beneficiary is able to return to work or full recovered, the program
      may suspend or terminate benefits. However, statutory and regulatory barriers
      limit the program’s ability to stop or adjust payments based on a medical review
      without due process. The compensation payments would continue until a final
      decision is issued.

    Answer: 'The program plans to continue to utilize resources provided by Treasury''s
      Do Not Pay program. Additionally, the agency will continue to look at other
      cross enterprise sharing opportunities that may arise in the future. It will
      continue to utilize its current audit corrective actions with its staff and
      current medical bill pay contractors. As needed, the program may add additional
      auditing actions to identify areas that may be of concern to stakeholders. Additionally,
      the agency will fully cooperate with the OIG''s auditing program as part of
      the Department''s annual financial reporting requirements. Unit/Office level
      actions will focus on

      issues that can cause IP''s/UP''s such as compensation rate reviews and official
      pay rate determinations. Use of DNP will help the program''s effort to focus
      on the cause of eligibility issues such as offsetting and deceased persons.
      Monthly medical bill pay audits ensure the program''s medical bill contractors
      are processing payments consistent with program requirements. The course of
      action planned allows the agency to monitor payments and identify potential
      IP/UP''s and their root causes at multiple levels. Additionally, the use of
      data allows the program to combine individual audit findings into trends to
      perform root cause analysis. This multilayered approach can lead to identifying
      trends, which will lead to better training and potentially automated controls
      to reduce future improper payments. The agency will continue to prioritize payment
      processing and the identification of improper payments. Each week, the program
      makes millions of dollars and payments, and regular monitoring is key to future
      root cause analysis. The agency will also look for opportunities that may lead
      to implementation of systematic controls as well as its efforts to redress over
      and under payments after they have been identified.'
