- Answer: "OIG did not make any new recommendations in 2024-FO-0006 but the three\
    \ recommendations from prior reports remain open:\n\n2022-FO-0005 2A - Develop\
    \ and implement a plan that ensures the continuity of adequate internal controls\
    \ over the PIH-TBRA program to detect and prevent improper payments, which can\
    \ be implemented in a virtual environment. This plan should include how HUD can\
    \ review tenant files or other information that validates tenant data remotely\
    \ without compromising PII. \n\n2023-FO-0009 1A - Establish an improper payment\
    \ council within HUD that consists of senior accountable officials from across\
    \ the Department with a role in the effort that would work to identify risks and\
    \ challenges to compliance and identify solutions as a collaborative group. This\
    \ is a priority open recommendation. A final action target date has not been established\
    \ for this recommendation because OCFO has not provided an acceptable proposed\
    \ management decision*.\n\n2024-IG-0001 - Develop and execute a detailed plan\
    \ and timeline for both testing and reporting estimates of improper payments in\
    \ the PIH-TBRA and PBRA programs in compliance with Federal law and OMB guidance.\n\
    \nTBRA: Attempted to leverage an existing Housing Assistance Payment Reconciliation\
    \ report to report Payee Tier IP/UP rate in FY24. Ultimately, this approach did\
    \ not meet the Payment Integrity requirements nor have the necessary precision\
    \ for reporting. PIH is undergoing system modernization which will provide visibility\
    \ at the tenant level and will allow for lower-level testing. System modernization\
    \ completion date is targeted for FY27.\n\nPBRA: HUD published IP/UP rate for\
    \ the Payee Tier for this program in FY24 based upon OMB guidance.\n* HUD does\
    \ not agree with recommendation 2023-FO-0009 1A."
