    Answer: FEMA will continue to provide regular training opportunities for regional
      partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. Training is
      specifically tailored to each audience and will continue to range from webinar
      recordings to on-demand workshops. Training offered through the Emergency Management
      Institute will also continue to offer self-paced courses, with a certificate
      of completion provided at the end. By continuing to train relevant parties and
      stakeholders, FEMA can continue to sustain and enhance program performance going
      forward, including the assurance that sufficient documentation is readily available.
