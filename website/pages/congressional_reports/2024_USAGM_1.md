  AdditionalInformation: "USAGM made a change to our Improper Payment methodology\
    \ for the FY 24 reporting period.  In prior years, USAGM's risk assessment methodology\
    \ included a comprehensive quantitative risk assessment of 145 sampled payments\
    \ per program on a three-year rotational cycle of all agency programs with annual\
    \ outlays of $10M or more during the assessment cycle.  USAGM uses an alternative\
    \ assessment cycle from Quarter 4 of the prior fiscal year through Quarter 3 of\
    \ the current fiscal year. \n\nUSAGM conducted an analysis of identified improper\
    \ payments from sampling testing between FY20 and FY23, showing consistently low\
    \ error rates. The quarterly self-reported data on improper payments ranged from\
    \ about 2% to 4% annually, primarily linked to payroll deductions (reviewed through\
    \ self-reported program review).\n\nGiven the low rates in previous years, USAGM\
    \ reduced testing to forty samples per year for each entity as part of a three-year\
    \ risk assessment cycle, in line with the Payment Integrity Information Act of\
    \ 2019. We will continue to implement thorough controls for self-reporting and\
    \ program reviews, demonstrating a commitment to strengthening oversight and ensuring\
    \ compliance with regulations to minimize the risk of improper payments."
