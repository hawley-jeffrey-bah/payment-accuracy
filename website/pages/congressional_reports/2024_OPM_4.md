    Answer: OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively
      engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.  OPM
      requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the data
      needs to be collected and reported to OPM by the health insurance carriers.  In
      FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements
      for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial
      Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial
      reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements
      and improper payment reporting. OPM remains on track for reporting the improper
      and unknown payment estimate in FY 2025.

    Description_Action_Taken: OPM’s annuity calculations involve both automated and
      manual components, the latter being susceptible to human error. Mistakes can
      arise from incorrect entries of effective dates, salary rates, or tours of duty,
      all of which impact annuity calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and
      developing targeted training can enhance accuracy and reduce improper payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: RS acknowledges the occurrence of improper payments;
      however, systemic limitations hinder the provision of detailed specificity.
      OPM's systems were not designed to analyze large data sets. Consequently, based
      on OMB's established root cause categories, only "failure to access data" is
      applicable. Overpayments within the agency’s purview result from family members
      or other sources failing to report an annuitant's death. These overpayments
      are deemed under the agency’s control because RS has access to the Do Not Pay
      file but is unable to search Do Not Pay prior to each recurring payment. Nevertheless,
      OPM engages in ongoing internal control activities, including surveys and data
      matching, to reduce potential improper payments from these occurrences. OPM
      performed the Consolidated Death Match (CDM) to identify discrepancies between
      the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system.
      This weekly match helps identify annuitants reported deceased by the SSA, while
      the Validated Agency Match System processes death information to terminate federal
      benefits and prevent further improper payments. Collection actions are initiated
      for any discovered overpayments.  Additionally, OPM utilizes the Treasury's
      Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants who should have been reported deceased.

    Action_Type: Audit
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: 'RS plans to use Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool
      (DRCST).  Which is an automated process that matches data from the Death Master
      File with the Consolidated Death Match. Furthermore, the Quality Assurance Group
      will maintain feedback through monthly and quarterly reports, offering recommendations
      as needed. These reports will include specific analyses to uncover trends that
      may not be immediately apparent, allowing for informed resource decisions and
      ensuring compliance with policies governing benefit determinations and payments.


      The Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool (DRC Scoring Tool) is a product used
      to identify payments at risk of being issued to a deceased payee.  The DRC Scoring
      Tool converts information into a confidence score based on the likelihood the
      individual is truly deceased. The Office of Payment Integrity at the Department
      of Treasury then uses the confidence score in combination with payment information
      within the customer’s dataset to identify the records that have the greatest
      potential impact for at-risk dollars.'
    Mitigation_Strategy: app6_1
  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2024 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: Regular quality assurance audits assess the accuracy
      of annuity payments, identifying training needs and systemic deficiencies. For
      instance, targeted training based on audit findings has enhanced staff knowledge
      and improved accuracy. However, systemic limitations hinder RS from providing
      specific data analysis, with overpayments largely attributed to failures in
      reporting annuitant deaths.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Accountability: The Retirement Services Associate Director is accountable for
      the improper payment rate.  This criteria is an item included in the annual
      performance appraisal.  In addition, RS operation managers are held accountable
      for achieving accuracy in the initial adjudication of claims.  The Quality Assurance
      audit results provide the accuracy rate.   Another step taken is the Annual
      Assurance Statement and Management Controls.  The Retirment Services Associate
      Director sign a memo statement that she is aware of the internal controls and
      meeting the requirements of the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA)
    Needs1: Using the existing internal controls, human capital, and information systems
      and other infrastructure RS was able to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown
      Payments to achieve the tolerable rate. The FY 2024 Improper Payments and Unknown
      Payments rate is 0.33 percent. The improper payment rate for overpayments was
      0.32 percent.
    Needs2: An upgrade to the current legacy system is essential for properly categorizing
      the root causes of improper payments. RS leadership is actively pursuing modernization
      initiatives to prevent such payments, collaborating with OPM leadership to prioritize
      and secure funding. An IT Roadmap has been delivered, with modernization costs
      assessed through FY 2028.
    Sufficiency: An upgrade to the current legacy system is necessary to accurately
      categorize the root causes of improper payments. RS is currently seeking additional
      funding to enhance process automation.  The FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification
      includes $6.5 million for improving the online retirement application and digital
      file system.   RS is unable to properly categorize $243.70 million in overpayments.
      However, regular Quality Assurance audits help assess accuracy and identify
      any training or systemic deficiencies.  Delayed or absent reporting from an
      annuitant's family or other sources can result in improper payments. The improper
      payment rate decreased from FY 2023 to FY 2024, demonstrating the effectiveness
      of current corrective actions.

    Answer: 'Overpayments within the agency''s control typically stem from outdated
      systems that do not automate the processing of available intra-agency data during
      payment processing. These antiquated systems lack the capability to provide
      comprehensive data necessary for identifying risk areas related to improper
      payments. For instance, overpayments often occur because death data is not directly
      linked to the payment file, preventing immediate account suspensions. Although
      the agency has access to this death data, overpayments are still considered
      within our control.  To mitigate improper payments, the agency employs several
      measures, including: Annuitant Surveys: These are sent electronically or by
      mail to verify eligibility.   Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal: Monthly searches are
      performed to verify deaths reported through various sources (e.g., EVVE-FOD,
      DOD, DOS) to prevent further payments.'

    Answer: Payments may be classified as unknown when additional information is required
      to confirm the accuracy of a recipient's monthly benefit. Insufficient or missing
      evidence can also result in unknown payments.  More accurate Agency application
      submissions would potentially mitigate common causes of unknown payments.

    Answer: Federal agencies are required to provide complete retirement packages.
      Through audits, the Quality Assurance Group identifies retirement claims that
      need additional information or clarification to determine if a recipient is
      receiving the correct monthly benefit. Insufficient or missing evidence can
      result in unknown payments. These types of errors can impact the amount of the
      improper payment amount. The improper payment amount is also impacted by the
      length of time it takes to receive sufficient information. The payment cannot
      be moved out of the unknown category and classified as proper or improper until
      all necessary documentation is received.
