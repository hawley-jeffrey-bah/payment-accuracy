  AdditionalInformation: The Department has moved away from using an equally weighted
    qualitative factor approach when assessing each DOI and OMB risk factor. Instead,
    the Department now utilizes a risk-based approach when assessing each factor,
    as noted within Appendix C. Any risk-weighting adjustment(s) may vary year over
    year and will be dependent on the current payment integrity operating environment,
    managements discretion, and risk management functions.
