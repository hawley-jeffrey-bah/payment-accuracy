SurveyData:
- Answer: The last analysis NARA completed to determine whether recovery audits would
    be cost effective, they randomly selected several accounting firms located in
    the DC metro area from the GSA schedule (SIN 520-9). Using the price list, NARA
    compared the hourly charge for one supervisor, one staff accountant/analyst, and
    one technician/data entry specialist. NARA's improper payments were divided by
    the hourly cost for each vendor to determine how many hours could be billed at
    that rate before the cost of the audit would exceed the yearly improper payments
    identified. NARA's improper payments are recovered nearly 100% through its standard
    recovery methods and therefore, it has never proved cost effective for NARA to
    engage an audit firm to conduct payment recovery audits.
