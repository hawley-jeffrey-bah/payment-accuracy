- Answer: "The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) determined that DHS complied\
    \ with 9 out of 10 Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements.\
    \ The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish improper\
    \ payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) estimates for programs susceptible to\
    \ significant improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement\
    \ to publish IP and UP estimates for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\
    \ Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program in fiscal year (FY) 2023.\
    \ \n\nThe DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the\
    \ PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and\
    \ unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring\
    \ that DHS follows the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reporting requirements\
    \ for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C\
    \ of OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the\
    \ time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered\
    \ open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following\
    \ actions to resolve the OIG recommendations:\n•\tDHS will complete the PIIA Phase\
    \ 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance\
    \ – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY\
    \ 2024 reporting. \n•\tDHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant\
    \ program, to include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance\
    \ for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data\
    \ call for publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. \n\nTo date, DHS has completed\
    \ assessment over the FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity for the FEMA Public\
    \ Assistance – VAYGo program and is publishing improper payment error estimates\
    \ for this 24-month disbursement period in the 2024 reporting cycle. As part of\
    \ the 2024 reporting cycle requirements, DHS is providing information describing\
    \ the actions that the agency has taken and/or will take to come into compliance\
    \ as required per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C requirements for a first-year\
    \ noncompliant program.  Based on the timeline for actions to come into compliance,\
    \ the majority of the associated activities are expected to be fully completed\
    \ in 2024."
