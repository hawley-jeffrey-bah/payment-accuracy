SurveyData:
- Answer: "Condition 1: The payment of real estate taxes in most leases is designed\
    \ to be a passthrough from the landlord’s real estate tax bill.  The landlord\
    \ pays the taxing authority and GSA pays the landlord for its share based on percentage\
    \ occupancy of the building.  The real estate payment is incorporated into the\
    \ GSA annual rent payment.  If the actual taxes are more than the amount paid\
    \ through rent, GSA owes the landlord the difference.  If the actual taxes are\
    \ less than the amount paid through rent, the landlord owes GSA the difference.\
    \  Recoveries arise when Lessor fails to report either of these two scenarios\
    \ by not sending GSA the appropriate tax bills.    \n\nResolution 1: GSA has established\
    \ agencywide procedures to perform annual reviews of all leases when the landlord\
    \ does not send in taxes.  These procedures have significantly decreased improper\
    \ payments in this area in the last 4 years.\n\nCondition 2: There are several\
    \ variables that can cause overpayments at the start up of a lease such as broker\
    \ commission credits, free rent credits, and credits for holdover payments on\
    \ a preceding lease, etc.  The overpayments exist if these credits are not entered\
    \ in the billing system (REXUS) or not properly transferred from the billing system\
    \ to the payment system (Pegasys).\n\nResolution 2: Checklists have been developed\
    \ in GSA's Regions to ensure that all credits are entered into the billing system\
    \ (REXUS).  Also, in July of 2020, the REXUS to Pegasys interface automatically\
    \ transfers data from REXUS to Pegasys so that it is no longer a manual process\
    \ of entering credit data for leases into Pegasys which has helped reduce errors."

- Answer: GSA's Recovery Audit contractor uses lease contracts and other lease documents
    to develop a detailed monthly rental schedule from lease commencement to most
    recent rent payment. This schedule is then compared to actual payments by month
    to determine if there are any discrepancies. If discrepancies are discovered,
    they are quantified and identified as to the nature and origin. A review of real
    estate tax adjustments is also done for each lease. Tax adjustments are reviewed
    for accuracy on the part of the Lessor’s submission of tax bills.

- Answer: GSA's recovery audit efforts currently target PBS’ “rental of space”, a
    known area prone to improper payments. One common issue that causes an improper
    payment to be not collectable is that when a building is sold or ownership is
    transferred, the entity GSA has a claim against may be dissolved. It's not unusual
    for companies to dissolve their LLCs after a building sale or transfer, making
    recovery of funds difficult. Additionally, GSA has encountered cases where companies
    declare bankruptcy. In these situations, claims are ranked in order of priority,
    and GSA’s claims often receive low priority among the creditors.
