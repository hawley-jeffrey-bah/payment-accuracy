    Answer: 'OPM’s annuity calculations have automated and manual components. The
      manual components are subject to human error. Errors can include entering incorrect
      effective dates, salary rates, and/or tours of duty, which all impact annuity
      calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and developing target training

      improves accuracy which affects improper payments.'
