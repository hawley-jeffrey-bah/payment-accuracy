    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA)
      Division provided refresher training in March 2023 to staff processing requests
      for COVID-19 Funeral Assistance. Going forward, FEMA will continue to coordinate
      with the Program Management Section (PMS) to send reminders to the staff processing
      funeral determinations to help reinforce guidance and enable personnel to mitigate
      errors. FEMA is also providing detailed instructions and examples of information
      processing that staff should verify on the internet and how to appropriately
      document within the application file record comments. In the early stages of
      COVID-19 Funeral Assistance, the internet search was not an option to resolving
      missing verification points. This was causing multiple calls to applicants asking
      them to provide the information, when funeral homes were not responding to verification
      calls, and leading to a high number of ineligible cases. Later guidance was
      updated to include an internet search in order to find information that would
      help with the verification process and reduce the burden on the applicant to
      provide. The internet search can assist caseworkers in finding a phone number
      of the funeral home, validating the funeral home is a valid business and confirming
      the death occurred by locating an obituary.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is strengthening the insurance
      verification process to assist in the review for a potential duplication of
      benefits. Through Funeral Assistance program reviews, there were noted instances
      applicant submitted limited insurance documents from life insurance companies,
      but it was not clear if the decedent actually had funeral and/or burial insurance
      coverage within the policy. As such, the program has made updates to the current
      operating procedures to strengthen the insurance verification process. FEMA
      will consider insurance specifically intended only for funeral and burial costs
      a duplication of benefits and will not consider more general insurance for which
      proceeds may be used towards funeral costs. This will continue to be program’s
      approach and it will be further clarified in the next version of the Individual
      Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG). In addition, FEMA is also enhancing
      the change management process as it relates to critical changes made throughout
      the assistance period to ensure that all relevant personnel and staff are aware
      of changes to the operating procedures and program requirements.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed a Validate as
      You Go (VAYGo) Module within the FEMA Grants Manager / Grants Portal platform.
      The module has workflows to support VAYGo testing, process requests for information,
      and enable FEMA Recipients to upload documentation for their respective VAYGo
      tested samples. FEMA continues to collaborate with Public Assistance Business
      Architecture to enhance the VAYGo Module with the goal of improving the VAYGo
      customer service experience for internal and external VAYGo stakeholders. This
      is an ongoing effort.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to train
      staff on proper procedures for reviewing submitted package documentation and
      making Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) scoped payments. VAYGo
      HQ conducts training courses via VAYGo University (VU) to support Regional and
      Recipient VAYGo stakeholders. VAYGo HQ is planning to host a workshop in early
      fiscal year (FY) 2025 with FEMA Regional VAYGo Points of Contact. This workshop
      will provide strategic and tactical strategies to support FY 2024 testing efforts.
      In addition, VAYGo HQ will continue to conduct VAYGo roadshows as requested
      from FEMA Regions. VAYGo HQ will continue to be part of the April 2025 Public
      Assistance Working Session (PAWS). FEMA will continue publication of helpful
      tools resources to guide the Public Assistance funding application process on
      the FEMA website. Over 20 courses will also remain readily available through
      the FEMA Emergency Management Institute (EMI) that can be accessed at any time
      and completed via self-pace. This level of engagement across multiple VAYGo
      spectrums will continue to enhance the level of knowledge required to strengthen
      the Public Assistance program leading to successful VAYGo results.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to train
      staff on proper procedures for reviewing submitted package documentation and
      making Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) scoped payments. Areas
      for potential improvement and enhancement often come from FEMA partners. FEMA
      partners may submit issues, opportunities, and feedback related to Public Assistance
      as a part of continuous improvement efforts via the “Feedback” feature in the
      Public Assistance Grants Portal or by working with their FEMA Regional Public
      Assistance officer. FEMA staff may also submit issues, opportunities, and feedback
      via the Change Control Tool on FEMA’s intranet site. FEMA’s Change Control Unit
      reviews and responds to requests through the Change Control Tool. The FEMA Office
      of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is planning to issue an updated VAYGo
      Guide late 2024 based on feedback captured from regions and recipients through
      the various training channels outlined in the narrative Training section. It
      is through the continuous and ongoing VAYGo communication and training channels
      that fosters a positive and successful VAYGo testing environment for all VAYGo
      stakeholders.

      Finally, the FEMA Public Assistance program regularly is subject to external
      and/or independent audit reviews to include those conducted by the DHS Office
      of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).'
