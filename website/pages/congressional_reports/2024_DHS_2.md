    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) developed a Validate as
      You Go (VAYGo) Module within the FEMA Grants Manager / Grants Portal platform.
      The module has workflows to support VAYGo testing, process requests for information,
      and enable FEMA Recipients to upload documentation for their respective VAYGo
      tested samples. FEMA continues to collaborate with Public Assistance Business
      Architecture to enhance the VAYGo Module with the goal of improving the VAYGo
      customer service experience for internal and external VAYGo stakeholders. This
      is an ongoing effort.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to train
      staff on proper procedures for reviewing submitted package documentation and
      making Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) scoped payments. VAYGo
      HQ conducts training courses via VAYGo University (VU) to support Regional and
      Recipient VAYGo stakeholders. VAYGo HQ is planning to host a workshop in early
      fiscal year (FY) 2025 with FEMA Regional VAYGo Points of Contact. This workshop
      will provide strategic and tactical strategies to support FY 2024 testing efforts.
      In addition, VAYGo HQ will continue to conduct VAYGo roadshows as requested
      from FEMA Regions. VAYGo HQ will continue to be part of the April 2025 Public
      Assistance Working Session (PAWS). FEMA will continue publication of helpful
      tools resources to guide the Public Assistance funding application process on
      the FEMA website. Over 20 courses will also remain readily available through
      the FEMA Emergency Management Institute (EMI) that can be accessed at any time
      and completed via self-pace. This level of engagement across multiple VAYGo
      spectrums will continue to enhance the level of knowledge required to strengthen
      the Public Assistance program leading to successful VAYGo results.

    Answer: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will continue to train
      staff on proper procedures for reviewing submitted package documentation and
      making Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) scoped payments. Areas
      for potential improvement and enhancement often come from FEMA partners. FEMA
      partners may submit issues, opportunities, and feedback related to Public Assistance
      as a part of continuous improvement efforts via the “Feedback” feature in the
      Public Assistance Grants Portal or by working with their FEMA Regional Public
      Assistance officer. FEMA staff may also submit issues, opportunities, and feedback
      via the Change Control Tool on FEMA’s intranet site. FEMA’s Change Control Unit
      reviews and responds to requests through the Change Control Tool. The FEMA Office
      of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is planning to issue an updated VAYGo
      Guide late 2024 based on feedback captured from regions and recipients through
      the various training channels outlined in the narrative Training section. It
      is through the continuous and ongoing VAYGo communication and training channels
      that fosters a positive and successful VAYGo testing environment for all VAYGo
      stakeholders.

    Answer: 'The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requires agencies
      to review and assess all programs and activities they administer and identify
      those determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate
      the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.
      In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123,
      Appendix C, "Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement", federal agencies
      are required to assess improper payments and report annually on their efforts.
      In compliance with these requirements, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
      (FEMA) Public Assistance - Validate as You Go (VAYGo) program will continue
      to conduct a review and publish results in 2025.


      In addition, FEMA will perform an assessment of internal control over financial
      reporting including performing tests of operating effectiveness, for the FY
      2025 performance period. These internal control assessments include a review
      over Grants Management.


      Finally, the FEMA Public Assistance program regularly is subject to external
      and/or independent audit reviews to include those conducted by the DHS Office
      of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).'
