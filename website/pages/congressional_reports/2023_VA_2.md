    Answer: Actions planned regarding automation include conducting quarterly matches
      with the Social Security Administration to identify variances between Social
      Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts
      reported by a beneficiary to VA. Differences indicate potential overpayments,
      so correcting the differences ensures VA is making correct payments and prevents
      future improper payments. In FY 2023, errors are largely attributable to failure
      to access data/information prior to issuing payment. To address the root cause,
      VA will use the existing match between Social Security Administration income
      data and VA income data for pension beneficiaries. This enables VA to identify
      variances which are indicators of potential overpayments. Claims with variances
      are prioritized and sent to claims processors in batches to resolve discrepancies,
      identify and establish debts for overpayments if applicable, and prevent future
      overpayments. In addition, VA uses the Social Security Administrations Death
      Master File to match against active beneficiaries and their dependents, which
      allows VA to stop payment timely for deceased beneficiaries. These ongoing Social
      Security Administration matches identify potentially deceased beneficiaries
      still receiving benefits for VA to stop benefits and prevent overpayments. These
      actions are designed to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure
      to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Automation
      was the best mitigation strategy in order to improve accuracy and accessibility
      of data to validate beneficiary income and eligibility status prior to payment.

    Answer: Actions planned regarding audit include randomly reviewing claim processors’
      work to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate
      pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. In FY 2023, errors
      are largely attributable to failure to access data/information prior to issuing
      payment. Due to administrative errors, corrective action includes conducting
      Special Focus Reviews to ensure claims processors apply proper policies and
      procedures in making accurate decisions. Additional audit actions include taking
      corrective actions when improper payments are identified such as proper adjudication
      of claims or collection of overpayments if applicable. These actions are designed
      to reduce improper payment errors associated with failure to access data/information
      needed to ensure proper payment amounts. Audit was the best mitigation strategy
      in order to identify discrepancies and reinforce adherence to policies and procedures
      to make accurate decisions prior to payment.

    Answer: Actions planned regarding automation include working to determine if a
      system update in the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System is needed
      to ensure Homemaker/Home Health Aide Service, Community Nursing Home, and Veteran
      Directed Care claims are paid appropriately. VA will then develop an effective
      corrective action for implementation. These actions are designed to address
      overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information,
      technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program
      not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation strategy because improper
      and unknown payments resulted from manual processes and human error.

    Answer: Actions planned regarding change process include working to ensure invoices
      are being validated per the contract pricing prior to payment. VA will also
      implement short and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home
      payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. In addition, VA
      will enforce contract requirements for third party administrators to bill at
      the correct allowable rates. These actions are designed to address overpayments
      and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information, technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and
      unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.
      Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger
      internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

    Answer: Actions planned regarding automation include VA will update the claims
      processing system, Electronic Claims Adjudication Management System, to identify
      and auto-deny Community Care Network claims that should be processed by a third
      party administrator. VA contracting will instruct third party administrators
      to deny out of network facility provider claims for emergent episodes of care.
      Additionally, VA will update system logic in the claims processing system to
      suspend or deny dental claims when provider criteria does not reconcile to the
      Veterans Care Agreement.

    Answer: Actions planned regarding change process include clarifying payment methodology
      within VA and third party administrators to bill at the correct allowable rates.  VA
      will also implement system checks for non-contract payments to suspend specific
      institutional inpatient and ambulance claims for manual review prior to payment.
      In addition, VA will instruct third party administrators to follow standard
      billing practices as defined in the contract. VA will communicate to claims
      processing agents to not process claims when timely filing requirements are
      not met.

SurveyData:
- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in\
    \ five major areas: Veterans Health Administration through a recovery audit, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center\
    \ in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center\
    \ which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes\
    \ Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices\
    \ (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the\
    \ Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness),\
    \ as well as specific recovery audits performed for the Supply Fund payments in\
    \ the Office of the Revolving Fund.  These are discussed in more detail below.\n\
    \nVeterans Health Administration\nVHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which\
    \ will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims\
    \ paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care\
    \ rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based\
    \ on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic\
    \ related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported\
    \ are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract. \n                \
    \                                                                            \
    \   \nVeterans Benefits Administration\nVeterans Benefits Administration uses\
    \ a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates\
    \ and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs\
    \ perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations,\
    \ proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate\
    \ payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined\
    \ efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting\
    \ Center, and Regional Offices.\n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial Services\
    \ Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery\
    \ audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration,\
    \ Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices.  The Financial Services\
    \ Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments\
    \ for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million\
    \ or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments\
    \ in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate\
    \ payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The\
    \ Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection\
    \ for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment\
    \ was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter\
    \ of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction.\
    \ In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the\
    \ improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical\
    \ facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds\
    \ for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned\
    \ the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection,\
    \ an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued\
    \ payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts\
    \ to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt\
    \ service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s)\
    \ to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs\
    \ can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing.\
    \ Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a\
    \ permanent alternative is identified by the customer.\n\nOffice of Revolving\
    \ Funds\nThe Office of Revolving Fund collaborates with the Office of Inspector\
    \ General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of\
    \ Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then\
    \ prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection.\
    \ If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will\
    \ work towards appropriate resolution."
