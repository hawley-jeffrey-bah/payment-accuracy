- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. At VA, these audits are performed in\
    \ five major areas: Veterans Health Administration through a recovery audit, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration for benefit programs where the Financial Services Center\
    \ in Austin, Texas does not process their payments, the Financial Services Center\
    \ which provides recovery audits for all payments it processes which includes\
    \ Veterans Health Administration payments, some Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ payments, National Cemetery Administration payments, and VA's Staff Offices\
    \ (for example, Office of Information Technology, Office of Management, and the\
    \ Office of Human Resources & Administration/Operations, Security & Preparedness),\
    \ as well as specific recovery audits performed for the Supply Fund payments in\
    \ the Office of the Revolving Fund.  These are discussed in more detail below.\n\
    \nVeterans Health Administration\nVHA utilizes a recovery audit contract, which\
    \ will audit claims for the VACC program. The review includes pre-authorized claims\
    \ paid under 38 U.S.C. § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care\
    \ rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral; was reimbursed based\
    \ on the appropriate methodology; and that the medical records support the diagnostic\
    \ related group billed for the services. The amount of recovery audits being reported\
    \ are only from FY 2018 per the condition of the contract. \n                \
    \                                                                            \
    \   \nVeterans Benefits Administration\nVeterans Benefits Administration uses\
    \ a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates\
    \ and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs\
    \ perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations,\
    \ proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans\
    \ Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate\
    \ payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined\
    \ efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting\
    \ Center, and Regional Offices.\n\nFinancial Services Center\nThe Financial Services\
    \ Center, a franchise fund (fee-for-service) organization, provides required recovery\
    \ audit services to Veterans Health Administration, National Cemetery Administration,\
    \ Veterans Benefits Administration, and VA Staff Offices.  The Financial Services\
    \ Center’s recovery audit program is focused on detection and recovery of overpayments\
    \ for each program the Financial Services Center services that expends $1 million\
    \ or more annually. The Financial Services Center reviews current and past payments\
    \ in database portals to identify and recover improper payments such as duplicate\
    \ payments, payments made in the incorrect amount, unapplied credits, etc. The\
    \ Financial Services Center works with its customers to process bills of collection\
    \ for identified improper payments. If the full amount of an improper payment\
    \ was paid via electronic funds transfer (EFT), FSC processes a letter of reversal/letter\
    \ of indemnity to recover the funds by having the bank reverse the erroneous transaction.\
    \ In cases where the improper payment is paid via treasury check or where the\
    \ improper amount was less/more than the full amount of the EFT, FSC or VA medical\
    \ facilities process a bill of collection requesting the vendor return the funds\
    \ for the improper amount. After a minimum of 45 days, if the vendor has not returned\
    \ the funds, requested additional information, or disputed the bill of collection,\
    \ an internal offset is processed to collect the funds from the next FSC-issued\
    \ payment(s) to that same vendor until the debt is satisfied. If previous attempts\
    \ to collect are unsuccessful, FSC refers the debt to the customer-preferred debt\
    \ service program to collect the funds from the next government issued payment(s)\
    \ to the vendor or employee until the bill is satisfied. Debt service programs\
    \ can include the Treasury Offset Program or Debt Management Center cross servicing.\
    \ Temporary changes to this process can occur at the program’s request until a\
    \ permanent alternative is identified by the customer.\n\nOffice of Revolving\
    \ Funds\nThe Office of Revolving Fund collaborates with the Office of Inspector\
    \ General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of\
    \ Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then\
    \ prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection.\
    \ If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will\
    \ work towards appropriate resolution."
