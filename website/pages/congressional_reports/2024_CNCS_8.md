- Answer: "For the program reporting rates over 10%, the OIG recommended AmeriCorps\
    \ include additional terms and conditions to its awardees to address the root\
    \ causes of improper payment and to implement financial consequences or additional\
    \ reporting requirements for grantees with improper or unknown payments. AmeriCorps\
    \ has drafted the language to include in the FY 2025 terms and conditions and\
    \ will continue to recover monies for collectable improper payments. \n\nAmeriCorps\
    \ had audit findings that it did not publish accurate or valid rates for ASN or\
    \ FGP because it does not include differences between filed Federal Financial\
    \ Reports and general ledgers as improper payments. The OIG recommends AmeriCorps\
    \ reconcile the difference between grantees’ internal account records and Federal\
    \ Financial Reports or to have the grantees perform the reconciliation during\
    \ the payment integrity testing cycle and report unmatched errors as unknown payments.\
    \ AmeriCorps does not agree that unmatched reporting errors represent improper\
    \ payments as grantees have until the close of their award to reconcile its accounting\
    \ records. AmeriCorps does not concur with the findings that resulted in the reported\
    \ noncompliance. \n\nAmeriCorps also received a finding that the National Service\
    \ Trust (NST) improper payment rate should have been reported in FY 2023. AmeriCorps\
    \ did not concur with this recommendation, as it reperformed a susceptibility\
    \ analysis in FY2023 to deem the NST susceptible, per an audit recommendation.\
    \ Therefore, NST was not required to be reported until FY2024. \n"
