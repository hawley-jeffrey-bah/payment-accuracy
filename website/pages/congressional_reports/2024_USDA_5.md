SurveyData:
- Answer: "Audit results and reviews are used to improve processes where mismanagement\
    \ or fraud may exist. Data is compiled, complex survey analytics are conducted,\
    \ and identifying root causes are employed to determine the number of improper\
    \ payments within the Department.  The data collected consists of but is not limited\
    \ to; the type of error(s) that led to the improper payment, the stage at which\
    \ the payment become improper, and who was responsible for the payment becoming\
    \ improper.  This comprehensive analysis allows the agency to identify the root\
    \ cause of improper payments and develop an effective corrective action plan.\n\
    At the Rural Housing Service conditions that give rise to improper payments include\
    \ instances where a tenant misstated their income or how many people are living\
    \ in the unit or if the owner did not update the paperwork to indicate that the\
    \ unit was vacant. Supervisory visits, plus checking verifying wage match by state\
    \ help catch and correct misstatements. \nSingle-Family Housing Direct borrowers\
    \ receiving subsidy must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household\
    \ becomes employed or changes employment, there is a change in household composition,\
    \ or if income increases by at least 10 percent.  The failure of the borrower\
    \ to timely report an increase in household income will likely result in an inaccurate\
    \ payment.  Borrowers identified as failing to report this increase are reviewed\
    \ for improper payments.  All borrowers receiving improper payments are notified\
    \ by mail and granted 30 days to file an appeal of RHS’s decision. If the recipient\
    \ receives improper payments due to false information, RHS will require the recipient\
    \ to repay overpayments within 30 days or the improper payment will be collected\
    \ through a foreclosure."

- Answer: 'Programs that determined that it was not cost effective to conduct recovery
    audits in certain programs based this decision on several factors including:


    •The effective processes already has in place to identify, recover, and report
    improper payments;

    • Low improper payment rate;

    • The insignificant amount of improper payments recaptured using the Department’s
    recovery audit program; and

    • If the program contracted for its own audit recovery program, the time and effort
    to conduct the program would not be commiserate with the funds recaptured.'
