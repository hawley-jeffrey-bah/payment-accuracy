    Answer: OPM’s annuity calculations involve both automated and manual components,
      the latter being susceptible to human error. Mistakes can arise from incorrect
      entries of effective dates, salary rates, or tours of duty, all of which impact
      annuity calculations. Identifying specific skill gaps and developing targeted
      training can enhance accuracy and reduce improper payments.

    Answer: 'RS plans to use Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool (DRCST).  Which
      is an automated process that matches data from the Death Master File with the
      Consolidated Death Match. Furthermore, the Quality Assurance Group will maintain
      feedback through monthly and quarterly reports, offering recommendations as
      needed. These reports will include specific analyses to uncover trends that
      may not be immediately apparent, allowing for informed resource decisions and
      ensuring compliance with policies governing benefit determinations and payments.


      The Death Record Confidence Scoring Tool (DRC Scoring Tool) is a product used
      to identify payments at risk of being issued to a deceased payee.  The DRC Scoring
      Tool converts information into a confidence score based on the likelihood the
      individual is truly deceased. The Office of Payment Integrity at the Department
      of Treasury then uses the confidence score in combination with payment information
      within the customer’s dataset to identify the records that have the greatest
      potential impact for at-risk dollars.'
