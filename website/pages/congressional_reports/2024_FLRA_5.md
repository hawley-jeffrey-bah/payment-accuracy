- Answer: The IPERA also requires agencies to conduct payment-recapture audits for
    each program that expends $1 million or more annually, if conducting such audits
    would be cost-effective. Based on the criteria set forth in Appendix C of OMB
    Circular A-123, the agency has also determined that it would not be cost-effective
    to establish a recovery-audit program for its programs that expend more than $1
    million. Recoveries are not expected to be greater than the costs incurred to
    identify any overpayments.
