- Answer: Ultimately, the DHS Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the accountable official
    for the progress of the agency coming into compliance with PIIA. As DHS currently
    does not have a politically appointed and confirmed CFO, the accountable official
    is currently the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Stacy Marcott.

- Answer: 'The goals and requirements of PIIA are communicated to all levels of staff
    throughout the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and to relevant program office
    and procurement staff. The Department has taken extensive measures to ensure that
    managers, accountable officers (including Component CFOs), programs, and states
    and localities are held accountable for reducing and recapturing improper payments.
    In addition, the Department’s CFO, Deputy CFO, and senior staff have

    performance expectations related to payment integrity and financial stewardship
    incorporated into their annual performance plans.


    As a strong internal control environment is the best way to prevent and detect
    improper payments, Component managers are responsible for completing internal
    control work on payment processing as part of the Department’s OMB Circular No.
    A-123 effort. They are further responsible for establishing and maintaining sufficient
    internal controls, including a control environment that prevents improper payments
    from being made, effectively managing improper payment risks, and promptly detecting
    and recovering any improper payment that may occur.'
