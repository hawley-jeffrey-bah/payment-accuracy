SurveyData:
- Answer: Grant payments continue to represent the greatest proportion of overpayments
    identified through the recovery audit. DOT attributes the cause for grant-related
    overpayments to administrative errors made by entities external to the Department.
    In particular, administrative errors made by grant recipients when seeking reimbursement
    from COVID relief funding sources for costs incurred prior to pandemic. Since
    FY 2021, DOT has sought to conduct quantitative improper payment risk assessments
    (Phase 1) of COVID relief payments along with our annual estimates (Phase 2).
    The reviews reinforce DOT program oversight controls over relief funds administered
    by grant recipients and provide targeted actions for identified errors. The recovery
    audit provides an additional layer of detective controls to assess and confirm
    whether DOT’s improper payments remain within tolerable ranges.

- Answer: "DOT’s Payment Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating improper\
    \ payment reviews, reporting results, and monitoring the progress of corrective\
    \ actions in accordance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Office\
    \ of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for\
    \ Payment Integrity Improvement, and OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting\
    \ Requirements. Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed\
    \ the recovery audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2022 through\
    \ March 2023. \n\nDOT considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal\
    \ year 2023 audit to be recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s\
    \ service provider, typically recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly\
    \ from the payee, by offsetting a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt\
    \ to the Department of Treasury’s Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover\
    \ overpayments directly from the payees. In fiscal year 2023, recaptured overpayments\
    \ resulting from DOT errors were returned to the program or activity’s original\
    \ purpose."
