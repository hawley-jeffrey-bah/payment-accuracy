    Answer: 'The root cause for this category was related to not following statutory
      requirements for payment limitation and eligibility, acreage reporting, and
      conservation compliance. 1) Updates had been made to payment eligibility documents
      and new determinations were not made, forms were not completed correctly, and
      software was not updated accordingly, 2) Acreage reporting requirements were
      not followed properly and loaded into the software incorrectly, 3) Forms were
      not completed correctly and subsequently software was not updated appropriately.


      Statute requires Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage payments
      are made based on these three areas being correct.

    Answer: Incorrect acreage reporting, payment limitation and eligibility, and conservation
      compliance have been perennial findings for Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price
      Loss Coverage. While training has assisted in addressing these findings, automation
      enhancements are needed to assure errors are prevented.  In the meantime, specific
      national training has been given as recently as July 15 – 19, 2024. All trainings
      are recorded and posted on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s training
      SharePoint page.  Further, Safety Net Division holds bi-weekly calls with State
      Office Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage specialists to discuss
      findings, provide training, and answer questions. All calls are recorded and
      posted on Deputy Agriculture for Farm Program’s Agriculture Risk Coverage and

      to mitigate Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage’s improper payment
      dollars of $35.35 million related to statutory requirements not met.

    Description_Action_Taken: The root cause of these improper payments was failure
      to access data information. In order to fully mitigate these errors, program
      software will need to be modified, specifically to incorporate reading an applicant’s
      farm records to properly identify owners, operators, and other tenants and perform
      other cross checks to ensure the proper supporting documentation such as a lease
      or CCC-855 has been completed for the associated grazed acreage claimed.  Currently,
      Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded
      to enhance existing software.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit
      Corporation Section 4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit
      Corporation budget request and Working Capital Fund request drills to support
      this effort.  Estimated funding requirements for this system enhancement is
      $2 million.

    Answer: 'The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data
      information, and the overpayments were within the agency control (program administered
      by the Farm Service Agency).


      These errors primarily involve administrative oversights such as failure to
      obtain supporting documentation and written leases or form CCC-855 Lease Certification
      to support the application, and failure to ensure the lease documentation complies
      with the established policies.  Through software enhancements and training on
      proper processes for obtaining required supporting documentation and written
      leases/CCC-855 Lease Certifications, these corrective actions should reduce
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program’s overall improper payment dollars and percentage.  However,
      in order to effectively reduce the improper payments, system enhancements are
      required.  Farm Service Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately
      funded to modify software to incorporate farm record data to properly identify
      owners, operators, and other tenants and other cross checks to alert County

    Answer: The root cause for this category was related to not following statutory
      requirements primarily with acreage reporting, supporting documentation, and
      delegations of authority rules.  Acreage reporting requirements were not followed
      properly, predominantly with late-filed acreage reports incorrectly loaded into
      the software.  Applications were also acted upon by a representative without
      proper redelegation of authority in place or without the required supporting
      documentation submitted prior to approval.  Statute requires Livestock Forage
      Disaster Program payments are made based on these areas being compliant.

    Answer: Incorrect acreage reporting has been a reoccurring finding for Livestock
      Forage Disaster Program. Accurate accounting can be complex when producers have
      multiple fields, and especially in multiple counties, or when determined animal
      units are converted to acres. While training has kept these findings from increasing,
      automation enhancements are needed to fully assure that administrative errors
      are mitigated, however funding has not been available.  Specific national training
      has been conducted as recently as July 15-19, 2024. All trainings are recorded
      and posted on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Program
      Training site. Further, Safety Net Division holds monthly Livestock Forage Disaster
      Program trainings with State Office Livestock Forage Disaster Program specialists
      to discuss findings and address any questions. All calls are recorded and posted
      on Deputy Administrator for Farm Program’s Livestock Forage Disaster Program
      Training SharePoint site. These corrective actions are sufficient to mitigate
      the program’s $134.90 million of improper payment dollars related to statutory
      requirements not met.

    Answer: A tolerable rate for Livestock Forage Disaster Program has not been established;
      however, the Agency is in the process of establishing additional internal controls
      for its permanent programs such as Livestock Forage Disaster Program. For example,
      Farm Service Agency is in the process of establishing a monitoring system to
      assure that county offices review payments before being issued. The system also
      has an accountability component to identify offices that struggle to disburse
      proper payments. Once implemented, Farm Service Agency will be in a position
      to determine a tolerable rate based on established data.  Farm Service Agency

    Answer: "Incorrect grazing acres and production accounting errors were the two\
      \ primary findings that contributed to statutory requirements not being met.\
      \  1) Various grazing information such as animal units are manually entered\
      \ in the Grass for Grazing worksheet, which is a customized excel spreadsheet\
      \ that converts the information into acres. If for example, animal units are\
      \ determined incorrectly, or the data is erroneously entered in the worksheet\
      \ or payment software, the payment amount will be incorrect.  This manual process\
      \ has been identified as a software enhancement to automate the process preventing\
      \ many of these specific data entry errors. However, the resources have not\
      \ been available.  2) Production accounting may include, or be a combination\
      \ of, harvested, appraised, and assigned production of a crop within a county,\
      \ which may also include production from multiple farms with multiple fields.\
      \ If one of the three types are determined incorrectly, the sum of the three\
      \ will be incorrect, leading to an improper payment. The Noninsured Crop Disaster\
      \ Assistance Program task force formed in the spring of 2024, suggested policy\

      \ example is removing the requirement that all production must be verifiable\

    Answer: Incorrect acreage reporting and production accounting have been perennial
      findings for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. Accurate accounting
      can be complex when producers have multiple fields, and especially in multiple
      counties, or when determined animal units are converted to acres. While training
      has kept these findings from increasing, automation enhancements are needed
      to assure that acres are not missed, and animal units are converted correctly;
      however, funding has not been available. In the meantime, current payment software
      has hard stops or warning boxes to alert users when data is missing, or procedures
      are not being followed. Specific national training has been given as recently
      as July 15-19, 2024. All trainings are recorded and posted on Deputy Administrator

    Answer: A tolerable rate for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program has not
      been established however, the Agency is in the process of establishing additional
      internal controls for its permanent programs such as Noninsured Crop Disaster
      Assistance Program. For example, Farm Service Agency is in the process of establishing
      a monitoring system to assure that county offices review payments before being
      issued. The system also has an accountability component to identify offices
      that struggle to disburse proper payments. Once implemented, Farm Service Agency
      will be in a position to determine a tolerable rate based on established data.

    Answer: "The root cause for this category was related to not following statutory\
      \ requirements. The agency’s internal assessment of Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters\
      \ identified the leading causes for improper payments to be administrative in\
      \ nature, resulting in processing errors, insufficient documentation, and inability\
      \ to authenticate producer eligibility.  These errors included applications\
      \ for ineligible participants and/or land; incomplete or improperly filed documentation\
      \ supporting proper cost share payment; and missing, incomplete, or improperly\
      \ filed Farm Service Agency or Commodity Credit Corporation forms required for\
      \ Emergency Conservation Program-Disasters.  Lack of sufficient documentation\
      \ from the producer was also a factor in making it difficult to reliably authenticate\
      \ the eligibility of claims, resulting in inaccurate payments.\n\nEmergency\
      \ Conservation Program-Disasters is not a recurring program that Farm Service\
      \ Agency personnel administer on a regular basis. Rather, Emergency Conservation\
      \ Program-Disasters is a program administered following a qualifying disaster\

    Description_Action_Taken: "Serious Deficiency Proposed Rule\nThe Food and Nutrition\
      \ Service (FNS) proposed a revision to the Serious Deficiency (SD) process for\
      \ Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Summer Food Service Program\
      \ (SFSP) in a Proposed Rule. After the Proposed Rule was published in February\
      \ 2024, FNS hosted webinars and presentations at conferences attended by stakeholders.\
      \ The Proposed Rule’s public comment period ended May 21, 2024. At that point\
      \ FNS assessed the comments on the proposed rule and began drafting a Final\
      \ Rule. In addition, FNS began work on a companion application designed to help\
      \ State agency users apply the SD process when evaluating the performance of\
      \ CACFP program sponsors and facilities. Together, these will streamline the\
      \ SD process and provide a user-friendly method for accurately implementing\
      \ the process. This will improve our method for identifying and ultimately addressing\
      \ SDs in CACFP.\nChild Nutrition (CN) Program Integrity Rule \nFNS expects the\
      \ rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at all\
      \ levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to help\
      \ FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,\
      \ resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program\
      \ requirements. Of particular importance to the National School Lunch Program\
      \ (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP), the rule allows States to adopt\
      \ a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities (SFAs); previously\
      \ states reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years. States that adopt\
      \ a review cycle longer than three years must establish and apply risk-based\
      \ criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This change allows\
      \ states to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS released\
      \ guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023. The rule also formalizes\
      \ a framework for developing, testing, and introducing integrity-focused process\
      \ improvements to address improper payment challenges that cannot be remedied\
      \ through monitoring alone.\nCN Dashboards\nOn March 26, 2024, FNS made a set\
      \ of State Agency CN data dashboards available to State CN agencies. The tool\
      \ aims to promote state agency access to performance data for their own analysis.\
      \ To coincide with publishing the dashboards, FNS launched a CN dashboard user\
      \ group. Through the user group, FNS will provide support and analytic strategies\

    Answer: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs are State-managed federal
      programs. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors, and
      ultimately to program recipients. Improper payments identified during the course
      of a review, audit, or other operational oversight activities can be recovered
      either through direct billing or through an offset of future program payments
      earned. FNS has been advised by our Office of General Counsel that since program
      statutes are very specific in describing circumstances under which recoveries
      of improper payments are to be made, recoveries made on the basis of a statistical
      sample or estimation procedure would not be appropriate, and that FNS would
      need new statutory authority to pursue such collections.

    Answer: In order to ensure manager, program, and State-level accountability through
      annual performance appraisal criteria for payment integrity and meeting Improper
      and Unknown Payment reduction targets, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Child
      and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) has implemented binding agreements to operate
      program according to all program rules. FNS has a robust review process that
      includes state-level review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews
      of States to ensure program integrity within the program. Applicable for Fiscal
      Year (FY) 2023, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has issued a policy memo to
      State program operators of the CACFP entitled, "Area Eligibility for Summer
      2022 and School Year 2022-2023." The memo provides guidance on determining CACFP
      eligibility for at-risk afterschool centers, which relies on school data, when
      complete school data is unavailable due to waivers used during the pandemic.
      FNS Regional Offices are completing three (3) Management Evaluations (MEs) per
      region, each of which also includes a local level review where FNS staff accompany
      State agencies (SAs) on reviews of operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment
      of State agency operations and administration and can result in a report of
      findings, which require the SA to correct any problems. This helps to ensure
      that SAs are properly monitoring certification and meal counting at the local
      level and are working with local operators to reduce improper payments. In addition,
      FNS continues to provide technical assistance related to the $50M released in
      FY 2024 for non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds for Child
      Nutrition (CN) State agencies to improve information technology (IT) systems.
      Throughout FY 2023, FNS worked with grant recipients who are using funds to
      develop, improve, maintain CN IT systems. FNS expects that the overall improvement
      of information technology systems by nTIG recipients administering CACFP will
      improve the SAs ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and
      take corrective actions.

    Answer: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food
      Program (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      to calculate annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census
      approach. Instead, FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies.
      FNS has developed a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
      Tiering Decision component of the program, and a separate methodology for the
      remaining components of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via
      the Erroneous Payments in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements
      vary significantly by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the
      rate of improper payments is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative
      methodologies for developing a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision
      meal claims component. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order
      to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals that millions of children
      rely on at childcare. Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined
      a tolerable rate for CACFP that fully balances payment integrity risk and controls
      while executing the program's processes to maximum possible effect as allowed
      under statute.

    Answer: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs are State-managed federal
      programs. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors, and
      ultimately to program recipients. Improper payments identified during the course
      of a review, audit, or other operational oversight activities can be recovered
      either through direct billing or through an offset of future program payments
      earned. FNS has been advised by our Office of General Counsel that since program
      statutes are very specific in describing circumstances under which recoveries
      of improper payments are to be made, recoveries made on the basis of a statistical
      sample or estimation procedure would not be appropriate, and that FNS would
      need new statutory authority to pursue such collections.

    Answer: In order to ensure manager, program, and State-level accountability through
      annual performance appraisal criteria for payment integrity and meeting Improper
      and Unknown Payment reduction targets, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Tiering
      Decision has implemented binding agreements to operate program according to
      all program rules. FNS has a robust review process that includes State-level
      review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of States to ensure
      program integrity within the program. Applicable for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023,
      FNS has issued a policy memo to State program operators of the CACFP FDCH Tiering
      Decision entitled, "Area Eligibility for Summer 2022 and School Year 2022-2023",
      providing guidance on determining CACFP eligibility when school data is unavailable.
      FDCHs use school or census data to establish geographic eligibility. FNS Regional
      Offices are completing three (3) Management Evaluations (MEs) per region, each
      of which also includes a local level review where FNS staff accompany State
      agencies (SAs) on reviews of operators. MEs provide a periodic assessment of
      SA operations and administration and can result in a report of findings, which
      require the SA to correct any problems. This helps to ensure that SAs are properly
      monitoring certification and meal counting at the local level and are working
      with local operators to reduce improper payments. In addition, FNS continues
      to provide technical assistance related to the $50M released in FY 2024 for
      non-competitive Technology Innovation Grant (nTIG) funds for Child Nutrition
      (CN) State agencies to improve information technology (IT) systems. Throughout
      FY 2023, FNS worked with grant recipients who are using funds to develop, improve,
      maintain CN IT systems. FNS expects that the overall improvement of information
      technology systems by nTIG recipients administering CACFP will improve the SAs
      ability to train, monitor, provide technical assistance, and take corrective
      actions.

    Subheading: ''
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: USDA
    Answer: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food
      Program (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      to calculate annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census
      approach. Instead, FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies.
      FNS has developed a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
      Tiering Decision component of the program, and a separate methodology for the
      remaining components of Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities via
      the Erroneous Payments in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS). Because requirements
      vary significantly by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the
      rate of improper payments is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative
      methodologies for developing a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision
      meal claims component. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity in CACFP in order
      to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals that millions of children
      rely on at childcare. Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not yet determined
      a tolerable rate for CACFP that fully balances payment integrity risk and controls
      while executing the program's processes to maximum possible effect as allowed
      under statute.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      Through a rulemaking effective October 26, 2023, the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) lowered the eligibility threshold for school participation in the CEP
      from an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) of 40% to 25%. FNS research shows
      that schools participating in CEP have notably lower certification error than
      schools that do not participate. Based on these findings, FNS expects that increased
      CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction
      in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule
      was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we
      expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from
      this change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.  FNS released supporting
      guidance material, including a fact sheet, published February, 2024.


      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      FNS is engaged in research related to integrity in the National School Lunch
      Program(NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). APEC IV has completed data collection
      and will soon move on to analyzing data to establish an NSLP/SBP improper payment
      (IP) rate. With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use
      a new baseline estimate for IP in NSLP and SBP, improving our projected error
      rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study
      also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications.
      From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in
      online applications used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price
      meals.


      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and State administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.  FNS
      released guidance on the updated review cycle December, 2023.


      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address IP challenges that cannot
      be remedied through monitoring alone.


      Direct Certification with Medicaid Demonstration (DC-M)

      FNS approved 5 new states to participate in the DC-M Projects for school year
      (SY) 2024-2025. Once the 5 new states implement the DC-M matching, the total
      number of states participating in DC-M will be 43. FNS research confirms that
      participation in DC-M improves program integrity by replacing the traditional
      household application for school meal benefits with an automated data match
      against existing household income records.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: USDA
    Answer: Overpayments are outside of the agency's control because Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) programs are state-managed federal programs. As such, program
      payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies (SAs), which then pass
      through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The activity that gives rise
      to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies and sponsors (schools
      and school food authorities or school districts) determine children’s eligibility
      for program benefits and serve meals to children. All of this activity occurs
      prior to the point that states submit claims to FNS for federal payment. Although
      FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does engage in extensive training,
      issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity audits in an effort to help
      states, and the local organizations under their oversight, improve program performance
      and limit program error.

    Answer: 'Process Change - Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      The Food and Nutrition service (FNS) expects that increased CEP eligibility
      will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction in certification
      error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule was published
      after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we expect that the
      full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from change will
      not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.


      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use a new baseline
      estimate for improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and
      School Breakfast Program (SBP), improving our projected error rates by starting
      with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study also includes a
      component that examines integrity features of online applications. From this
      sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications
      used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.


      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs,
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.


      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges
      that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.


      Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)

      Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified
      for free meals without the need for a household application based on household
      participation in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct
      certification is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification
      error in Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.



      Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)

      FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by
      nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State''s ability to train,
      monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.


      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to
      encourage adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting
      of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is
      an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit
      data to their States.'

      Through a rulemaking effective October 26, 2023, the Food and Nutrition Service
      (FNS) lowered the eligibility threshold for school participation in the CEP
      from an Identified Student Percentage (ISP) of 40% to 25%. FNS research shows
      that schools participating in CEP have notably lower certification error than
      schools that do not participate. Based on these findings, FNS expects that increased
      CEP eligibility will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction
      in certification error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule
      was published after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we
      expect that the full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from
      this change will not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.  FNS released supporting
      guidance material, including a fact sheet, published February, 2024.

      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      FNS is engaged in research related to integrity in the National School Lunch
      Program(NSLP)/School Breakfast Program (SBP). APEC IV has completed data collection
      and will soon move on to analyzing data to establish an NSLP/SBP improper payment
      (IP) rate. With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use
      a new baseline estimate for IP in NSLP and SBP, improving our projected error
      rates by starting with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study
      also includes a component that examines integrity features of online applications.
      From this sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: USDA
    Answer: Overpayments are outside of the agency's control because Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) programs are state-managed federal programs. As such, program
      payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies (SAs), which then pass
      through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The activity that gives rise
      to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies and sponsors (schools
      and school food authorities or school districts) determine children’s eligibility
      for program benefits and serve meals to children. All of this activity occurs
      prior to the point that States submit claims to FNS for federal payment. Although
      FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does engage in extensive training,
      issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity audits in an effort to help
      States, and the local organizations under their oversight, improve program performance
      and limit program error.

    Answer: 'Process Change - Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) Expansion

      The Food and Nutrition service (FNS) expects that increased CEP eligibility
      will correspond with a rise in CEP participation, a reduction in certification
      error, and a reduction in improper payments. Because the rule was published
      after the CEP election date for School Year (SY) 2023-2024, we expect that the
      full magnitude of decreases in improper payments resulting from change will
      not fully be observed until SY2024-2025.

      Progress on Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV

      With this update to the APEC study series, FNS will be able to use a new baseline
      estimate for improper payments in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and
      School Breakfast Program (SBP), improving our projected error rates by starting
      with a more recent, more accurate starting point. The study also includes a
      component that examines integrity features of online applications. From this
      sub-study, FNS aims to gain clarity on quality of data collected in online applications
      used by students and families who apply for free and reduced-price meals.

      Child Nutrition (CN) Integrity Rule

      FNS expects the rule’s provisions to strengthen the administration of CN programs,
      at all levels, through enhanced oversight and enforcement tools designed to
      help FNS and state administering agencies to reduce program error of all types,
      resulting in more efficient operations and improved compliance with program
      requirements. Of particular importance to the NSLP and SBP, the rule allows
      states to adopt a 5-year administrative review cycle for School Food Authorities
      (SFAs); previously States reviewed SFAs a minimum of once every three years.
      States that adopt a review cycle longer than three years must establish and
      apply risk-based criteria to select SFAs for targeted follow-up reviews. This
      change allows States to direct limited resources where attention is needed most.

      The rule also formalizes a framework for developing, testing, and introducing
      integrity-focused process improvements to address improper payment challenges
      that cannot be remedied through monitoring alone.

      Direct Certification with Medicaid (DC-M)

      Direct certification is the process by which eligible children are certified
      for free meals without the need for a household application based on household
      participation in one or more means-tested Federal assistance programs. Direct
      certification is intended to reduce both household and administrative certification
      error in Local Education Agency (LEA) processing of household applications.

      Automation - Non-competitive Technology Innovation Grants (nTIGs)

      FNS expects that the overall improvement of information technology systems by
      nTIG recipients administering NSLP will improve the State''s ability to train,
      monitor, provide technical assistance, and corrective actions.

      Encourage state agency adoption of FNS-developed data validation service

      FNS modified its process of reviewing state agency management of the NSLP to
      encourage adoption of an FNS-developed tool to reduce error in the reporting
      of NSLP administrative data. The tool, the Data Validation Service (DVS) is
      an Application Programming Interface (API) that States can include in their
      platforms for collecting data from their school districts. The DVS provides
      real-time edit checks and error messages to school districts as they submit
      data to their States.'

      review of local program operators and FNS-level reviews of SAs to ensure program
      integrity in SBP. Additionally, at the federal level, senior executives are
      held responsible for program oversight and integrity via the annual strategic

    Answer: The School Breakfast Program (SBP) does not have an administrative infrastructure
      for producing yearly estimates of improper payment rates and dollar values.
      Therefore, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) uses periodic Access, Participation,
      Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) studies to provide baseline error rate
      estimates for SBP. In non-study years, FNS typically provides annual estimates
      using the baseline data from APEC, program administrative data, and macroeconomic

      by assessing WIC State agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating
      the accomplishment of WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance
      to State agencies and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2025-2027,
      FNS' ME target area for WIC is Food Delivery and Vendor Management. Food Delivery
      involves the security and accountability of food benefits, to include the process
      of managing and monitoring the disposition of all food benefits. Vendor management
      involves the ongoing management of selection, authorization, cost containment,
      training, monitoring, and sanctioning of vendors, to include claims against
      vendors as well as the conduct of vendor-related administrative appeal procedures.
      In addition to the ME target area, FNS also conducts a national risk-based ME
      assessment to identify State agencies with known program integrity issues. Program
      integrity issues include issues relating to improper payments, vendor management,
      certification/eligibility, fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary
      values risk to the Program. The target area supports the United States Department
      of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer
      service to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC
      Program through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS

    Answer: The agency has what is needed with respect to internal controls, human
      capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate. The Special Supplemental Nutrition
      Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program integrity is a priority
      for the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). FNS has the administrative infrastructure
      for meeting reduction targets, establishing and maintaining sufficient internal
      controls, and producing yearly estimates of WIC improper payment rates and dollar
      values. Management evaluations (MEs) are FNS's primary oversight mechanisms.
      MEs include onsite reviews of State and local agency operations, and reviews
      of program-specific documentation. FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related
      to program integrity and analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities
      to improve program administration and integrity.

    Answer: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is currently engaged in an effort
      to develop an improper payment estimate for the Summer Food Service Program
      (SFSP) in accordance with the Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP)
      guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). To assess the
      feasibility of proposed methodologies, FNS will collect data over a 5-year period
      that began in the summer of 2024. Upon completion of these studies and analysis
      of their data, FNS will provide an improper payment estimate using the piloted
      methodologies if they prove feasible. FNS anticipates reporting an estimate
      for Fiscal Year 2029 if a methodologically robust approach is established.

    Description_Action_Taken: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) entered into contracts
      to provide State Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administering
      agencies with access to two commercial databases of employment and earnings
      records. As of September 12, 2024, 27 states have onboarded to one or both vendors'
      services. States can use these services to verify earned income sources and
      amounts for SNAP households. Since income is a key factor in the SNAP benefit
      calculation, these efforts are expected to help improve payment accuracy.

    Description_Action_Taken: Since the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP) is administered by State agencies, who also determine the structure of
      SNAP amongst numerous policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects, corrective
      actions must originate in and be tailored to each individual State agency's
      circumstances and particular root causes of payment error. As such, the Food
      and Nutrition Service (FNS) is primarily focused on providing training and equipping
      State agencies with the knowledge and tools needed to individually develop meaningful
      root cause analysis and corrective action plans, including through the issuance
      of policy guidance. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, FNS developed tools to assist
      with conducting root cause analysis by State agencies, including publishing
      two dashboards for State Quality Control (QC) managers and staff to use to analyze
      causes of payment errors and trends over time and held two training sessions
      with both State and Federal users. FNS also introduced the new Keys to Payment
      Accuracy, that provides best practices to states on how to improve payment accuracy
      and began a series of webinars targeted to state and regional office staff to
      discuss how to use the Keys as they develop their payment accuracy related corrective
      action plans.

      are processed and administered by State agencies. FNS provides State agencies
      with guidance related to eligibility determinations, provides oversight and

      State agencies make decisions about how to administer the program amongst various
      policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects; directly determines eligibility
      for SNAP; and provides benefits to recipients. Therefore, FNS must work with
      its State agency partners to measure, monitor, and address improper payments.

    Answer: RMA's comprehensive analysis of improper payment criteria relates the
      root cause (i.e., the type of error that led to the improper payment, who was
      responsible for the improper payment, and at what stage of the crop insurance
      life cycle the improper payment occurred) of the improper payment directly to
      the amount of the improper payment.  This strategic assessment allows RMA to
      develop corrective action plans that address the root causes that result in
      larger amounts of improper payments. A continuous analysis of root causes and
      implementation of corrective actions that help remediate improper payments has
      allowed RMA to maintain a tolerable error for multiple years.  Federal Crop
      Insurance is a multi-billion-dollar program. RMA’s ability to maintain an improper
      payment error rate below three percent for ten consecutive years indicates the
      effectiveness of the measures we’ve taken to reduce improper payments.

    Answer: Risk Management Agency's (RMA's) Administrator and Deputy Administrators
      of Compliance, Product Management, and Insurance Services are held accountable
      through annual performance plans to establish internal controls that prevent
      improper payments from being made, maintain internal controls that prevent improper
      payments from being made, detect improper payments that are made, and recover
      improper payments.  The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center
      also provides oversight of RMA's internal controls.

    Answer: At this time, the agency has the necessary resources to maintain a tolerable
      improper payment rate.  This assumes that the program remains at the current
      size.  If the program expands, additional resources may be necessary.

    Answer: The agency’s most recent budget request includes funding to comply with
      A-123 and financial statement audit requirements, higher staffing and hiring
      needs, and improve programmatic compliance and oversight. The agency currently
      has enough resources to maintain a tolerable improper payment rate; however,
      additional resources are necessary to sustain program growth and increasing
      costs.
