    Accountability: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are the known as Beneficiary
      and Contributor Audit Program (BCAP). BCAP audits are designed to identify overpayments
      that must be recaptured, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter waste,
      fraud, and abuse. USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as Payment

      Quality Assurance (PQA). Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling methodology
      to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC, USF-LL, USF-RHC,
      and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan is to estimate an
      improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC rules. To recover
      improper payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery policy to standardize
      the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC improper payments
      are deemed collectible and USAC has either recovered or is in the process of
      recovering the improper payments.'
    Needs1: The High Cost program has the internal controls, human capital, information
      systems, and other infrastructure it requires to reduce improper payments to
      the target levels.  USAC continues to evaluate to ensure the proper infrastructure
      is in place.
    Needs2: The High Cost program team did not identify additional resources needed
      to improve the overall structure of the program in its most current budget submission.
      USAC continues to work with the FCC to determine the gaps in its overall requirements.
    Sufficiency: The High Cost Program will continue to focus on program integrity
      assurance (PIA) activities to mitigate improper payments. The PIA activities
      include collaborating with USAC's Audit and Assurance Division partners to provide
      the annual Circle of Life webinars, meeting with NECA monthly, and continue
      existing analysis and data validation for legacy funds. The annual Circle of
      Life webinar references FCC rules and provides common error examples and recommends
      best practices to avoid these findings.  The monthly NECA meeting is used by
      High Cost to evaluate processes based on audit finding feedback. With the annual
      data validation, High Cost compares projected and actual cost study data that
      determines carriers' support. The High Cost Program team will introduce a new
      compliance layer by developing additional PIA procedures leveraging enhanced
      analytics and testing capabilities on a sample basis to identify potential violations.

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: FCC
    Answer: The main cause of the overpayments is related to inadequate documentation-
      assets. The carrier is responsible for maintaining adequate documentation. Documentation,
      such as invoices, work orders and other documentation related to assets, should
      be maintained to verify the asset transactions were recorded in the proper amount.
      Documentation should be kept current and maintained by the carrier to allow
      for auditor review.

    Answer: USAC continues to work with states and territories to implement additional
      automated connections to eligibility databases.  Where a consumer’s eligibility
      cannot be confirmed automatically, USAC manually reviews appropriate documentation
      to confirm that a consumer is eligible to participate in the Lifeline program
      and is not receiving duplicative support.  USAC and its manual review vendor
      have robust Quality Assurance processes and continuously update training materials
      and resources for manual reviews.  The Lifeline Program will review the root
      cause of the errors identified in the assessments and will perform updates to
      training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation and

    Answer: Overpayments are outside of agency control because documentation is not
      required to receive payment.  Carriers are required to retain documentation
      and to make it available upon request.  To demonstrate how it evaluates the
      usage of it's subscribers.  USAC depends on the carrier to follow Commission
      rules related to non-usage.  The collection of documentation in advance would
      prevent timely payment and would be cost prohibitive.

      different Universal Service Fund (USF) program teams discussed strategic initiatives
      and risks that may impact USAC’s goals. The Risk Management Council meetings
      will continue to provide an opportunity to analyze and respond to identified
      changes and related risks to maintain an effective internal control system as
      well as effective enterprise systems management.

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Accountability: 'USAC’s payment recapture audits are known as Beneficiary and
      Contributor Audit Program (BCAP) audits. BCAP audits are designed to identify
      overpayments that must be recovered, assess compliance with FCC rules, and deter
      waste, fraud, and abuse. USAC’s improper payment testing program is known as
      the Payment

      Quality Assurance (PQA) program. Through PQA, USAC utilizes a statistical sampling
      methodology to estimate the annual amount of improper payments in the USF-HC,
      USF-LL, USF-RHC, and USF-S&L programs.  The goal of the PQA assessment plan
      is to estimate an improper payment error rate based on non-compliance with FCC
      rules. To recover improper payments, USAC has implemented an enterprise recovery
      policy to standardize the reporting and recovery of improper payments. All USAC
      improper payments are deemed collectible and USAC has either recovered or is
      in the process of recovering the improper payments.'
    Needs1: The Schools and Libraries program has the internal controls, human capital,
      information systems, and other infrastructure it requires to reduce improper
      payments to the target levels.  USAC continues to evaluate to ensure the proper
      infrastructure is in place.
    Needs2: The Schools and Libraries program team did not identify additional resources
      needed to improve the overall structure of the program in its most current budget
      submission. USAC continues to work with the FCC to determine any gaps in its
      overall requirements.
    Sufficiency: "The Schools and Libraries team is using data analytics to identify\
      \ potential competitive bidding issues.  Data analytics will be used to identify\
      \ potential conflicts of interest, prior to issuing funding commitments. The\
      \ team is also leveraging data analytics to improve competitive bidding training\
      \ and enhance compliance by adding content regarding the minimum 28 day waiting\
      \ period to select service providers, the factors for assessing responsive bids,\
      \ and document retention.  In addition, preventative controls have been added\
      \ to proactively identify and prevent the types of invoicing errors identified\
      \ in the PQA assessments from re-occurring in the future, and providing enhanced\
      \ training regarding the invoicing process. \n\nSchools and Libraries mitigation\
      \ strategy to reduce the improper payments have proven to be successful.  The\
      \ results of the strategy are clear with the reduction of the improper payment\
      \ rate to 1.27%, which is under the threshold of 1.50%."

    Answer: Invoicing Error and Internal Connections/Not Installed is the major cause
      of overpayments within agency control.  USAC’s Schools and Libraries Invoicing
      team is leveraging open data sets and coding capabilities to improve the efficiency
      of invoicing-related validations. In addition, the Schools and Libraries program
      team transitioned the invoicing process from the SL Legacy Systems to the E-Rate
      Productivity Center (EPC), which is expected to help identify invoicing errors
      before disbursements are issued.

    Answer: Competitive bidding is a formal process to identify and request the eligible
      equipment and/or services the applicants need, so that potential service providers
      can review those requests and submit responsive bids.  Schools and Libraries
      program applicants must conduct fair and open competitive bidding processes
      and select the most cost-effective equipment and services using the price of
      the eligible equipment and services as the primary factor. The applicant is
      responsible for ensuring that its competitive bidding process is compliant with
      FCC rules and free from any potential conflicts of interest.
