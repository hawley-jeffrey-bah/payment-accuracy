    Answer: 'Overpayments are outside of HHS''s control because the Child Care and
      Development Fund is a federally funded, state-administered block grant program,
      with funds awarded to states/recipients who then disburse funds to sub-recipients.
      Under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have

      flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including subsidy
      payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds
      for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments. Each state
      has maximum flexibility in developing the Child Care and Development Fund programs
      and policies that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.'

    Answer: HHS's planned actions for the Child Care and Development Fund program
      are adequate because HHS received specific root causes of errors and associated
      corrective actions identified by each reporting state under the policies unique
      to the state. HHS provided and will continue to provide targeted technical assistance
      based on the reported specific causes of errors for the state. Historically,
      training, and targeted technical assistance have been the primary methods used
      to address improper and unknown payments in the program. The reduction in the
      unknown payment rate from 2.41% in FY 2023 to 0% in FY 2024 and the maintenance
      of an error rate that is consistently below the statutory threshold indicates
      that this approach is adequate.

    Answer: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with
      the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
      Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
      Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this
      annual assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control
      and Risk Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable
      office. Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement
      which represents the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to
      the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating
      Division related to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal
      entities that receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes,
      and non-profit organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single
      Audit Act of 1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative
      Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that
      was in effect during FY 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities
      that expend $750,000 or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s
      fiscal year. With the Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released
      revisions to the Uniform Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective
      October 01, 2024.  In addition to the improper payment error rate calculation
      activities, overpayments are identified and recovered through Single Audits
      and HHS Office of Inspector General audits.  For each of the aforementioned
      activities, recipients are subject to disallowances for any expenditures not
      made in accordance with program regulations.

    Answer: HHS has resources to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to
      the tolerable rate for the Child Care and Development Fund program.  However,
      an increase in funding that includes a request to increase the federal administrative
      set-aside to improve accountability and oversight for the Child Care and Development
      Fund from one half of one percent to one percent  was requested in the HHS FY
      2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees to maintain and
      augment its ability to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to the
      tolerable rate.  Dedicated federal administrative funds are used for federal
      staff, program supports, IT/data systems modernization and maintenance, program
      oversight, and accountability, and overhead costs.  Further, up to one-half
      of one percent of the Child Care and Development Fund program funding is reserved
      for the provision of training and technical assistance.  ACF provides this technical
      assistance through targeted support, intensive and long-term engagement with
      recipients, peer-to-peer learning opportunities between the states, information
      briefs and toolkits, and other strategies that are responsive to recipient requests
      for support.  The increase in training and technical assistance funding in FY
      2023 resulted in continued investment in technical assistance to support recipients
      in improving their IT systems, including enrollment and eligibility tools for
      families and payments processes for providers, in order to improve the family
      and provider experience in the child care system. It also allowed for investments
      in other efforts to support recipients, including efforts related to payment
      practices, rate setting, and increasing access for families.

    Answer: Overpayments are outside of HHS's control because Title IV-E Foster Care
      Program is a federally funded, state-administered grant program, with funds
      awarded to states/recipients.  HHS administers formula and entitlement grants
      to support states and tribes in operating their child welfare systems, including
      foster care, and the information systems necessary to support these programs.
      States and tribes do not compete for these funds. Rather, they are distributed
      based on predetermined reimbursement rates and eligibility requirements, based
      on claims submitted by each jurisdiction to reimburse allowable costs the jurisdictions
      have certified as accurate.

    Answer: HHS anticipates that the level of planned or completed corrective actions
      will address the cause of the Improper Payments and potential Unknown Payments
      proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of the root cause.  During
      the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, HHS identified specific root
      causes of errors and associated corrective actions for each reviewed state.  In
      FY 2024, HHS resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E reviews, following a nearly
      four-year suspension due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the
      period of the suspension, HHS relied on previous data and experiences to develop
      and update its corrective action plans, which are designed to help states address
      the improper payments that contribute most to Title IV-E improper payments.  The
      adequacy of these actions is reflected in the low FY 2024 reported error rate
      of 4.82%.

      improper payments and unknown payments to the tolerable rate because HHS has
      not determined a tolerable rate for the Foster Care program.   In FY 2024, HHS
      resumed conducting onsite Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, following
      a nearly four-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The IV-E Review
      protocol is not conducted specifically for improper payment estimation but is
      instead governed by regulations authorizing federal monitoring of child welfare
      programs.  Data from the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews are used
      to calculate the Foster Care Error Rate.

    Answer: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees
      includes a request for $10.68 billion for the Payments for Foster Care, Prevention,
      and Permanency appropriation, which provides funding for the Title IV-E Foster
      Care  and other related programs.  This appropriation also supports administrative
      and training costs. This account is subject to sequestration of administrative
      costs in an otherwise exempt account in accordance with the Balanced Budget

      the funds within the parameters of approved budget categories. Periodically,
      Head Start funding recipients submit financial reports summarizing the cash
      transactions made for its federal award. Detail transaction level data is not
      submitted to HHS pre or post payment unless specifically requested by HHS in
      special circumstances, and even then, is limited to specific Head Start funding
      recipients and not across all Head Start funding recipients and/or payments.

    Answer: The causes of the technically improper payments in the Head Start program
      were primarily accounting related errors and missing required documentation
      in the records of the sampled Head Start funding recipients.  In several instances,
      payments were made from the incorrect account at the time of payment for which
      the allocation was corrected in a subsequent period.  Additionally, while the
      validity of some payments could be determined, all of the required supporting
      documentation was not maintained in the financial records.

    Answer: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of
      the HHS review, the available documentation was not available or sufficient
      to determine if the payments were proper or improper. For two large Head Start
      funding recipients selected for testing, the Head Start funding recipients were
      unable to provide sufficient documentation at the level of detail necessary
      to conduct the review. In other instances, the documentation provided was insufficient
      to support the calculations related to the payments.
    Heading: Causes of Improper Payments
    Key: cyp8

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: HHS
    Answer: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper
      Payments and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program because they not only
      focus on the specific errors identified during the improper payment review,
      but will also evaluate policies, processes, and procedures that could lead to
      improper payments. Targeted technical assistance will be provided to Head Start
      funding recipients to address the underlying causes of the errors. Planned corrective
      actions will also address not only areas warranting improvement at the Head
      Start funding recipient level, but also at the HHS level.  HHS also plans to
      monitor the implementation and interim effectiveness of the corrective actions
      to determine if additional corrective actions are warranted.  HHS's planned
      actions are proportional to the severity of the associated amount and rate of
      the root causes of errors in the Head Start program as they are based on the
      root causes of errors at both the recipient and federal level.

    Answer: HHS evaluates its processes and controls each year in accordance with
      the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management’s
      Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Controls, which includes
      Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement. As part of this
      annual assessment, HHS requires its offices to complete an Internal Control
      and Risk Management Certification that is signed by a senior member of the applicable
      office. Further, the HHS Operating Division prepares an assurance statement
      which represents the HHS Operating Division head's informed judgement as to
      the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Internal controls within the HHS Operating
      Division related to operations, reporting, and compliance. In addition, non-federal
      entities that receive federal funds, including states, local governments, tribes,
      and non-profit organizations, are subject to audit requirements under the Single
      Audit Act of 1984, as amended in 1996. The implementing guidance, Uniform Administrative
      Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, that
      was in effect during 2023, required Single Audits for nonfederal entities that
      expend $750,000 or more in federal awards during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal
      year. With the Office of Management and Budget's April 2024 released revisions
      to the Uniform Guidance, the threshold increases to $1,000,000 effective October
      01, 2024. In addition to the improper payment error rate calculation activities,
      overpayments are identified and recovered through Single Audits and HHS Office
      of Inspector General audits. Foreach of the aforementioned activities, recipients
      are subject to disallowances for any expenditures not made in accordance with
      program regulations.

    Answer: The HHS FY 2025 Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees
      request an increase for the Head Start program to support funding to stabilize
      their workforce through increased wages and benefits.  Qualified staff are leaving
      Head Start for better paying jobs, including in public school settings and in
      different sectors such as retail and hospitality. The staffing crisis is due
      to a confluence of factors, including persistently low and stagnant wages, particularly
      for frontline staff, lack of comprehensive benefits, and insufficient supports
      for staff health and wellness. This Budget request provides $543.7 million to
      account for a full Cost of Living Adjustment to support Head Start programs
      to keep pace with inflation. The lack of qualified staff is a contributing factor
      to limited understanding of financial and programmatic policies, processes,
      and procedures, which leads to an increase in the likelihood of improper and

    Answer: The overpayments identified under the EIPM program are considered to be
      within the agency's control because they resulted from the improper application
      of established policies and procedures. The majority of the overpayments identified
      resulted from the agency not following it's own guidance designed to help them
      complete their tasks. These actions include improper calculation of annual income
      amounts by not conducting those calculations in accordance with established
      guidelines and accepting documentation that does not meet requirements to resolve
      data matching issues. There are also system issues that lead to overpayments
      that can be addressed by the agency, such as failing to conduct periodic verifications
      of consumer eligibility due to technical problems interacting with trusted data
      sources.

      the improper payments that are recognized when a legally applicable requirement
      related to payment conditions is not satisfied by the Exchange, however, there
      was no impact on the total advance premium tax credit.  The cause of the Technically

      on the claim; enrolling a beneficiary when ineligible for CHIP; determining
      a beneficiary to be eligible for the incorrect eligibility category, resulting
      in an ineligible service or incorrect federal reimbursement amount being provided;
      not conducting beneficiary redeterminations timely or at all; or not performing,

      maintained documentation to show the screening requirements had been completed
      in accordance with regulations. During eligibility reviews, CMS was able to

      gathered around separate determinations (i.e., not a Medicaid/CHIP determination)

    Answer: Federal funds are dispersed to states for Medicaid program administration.
      States are then responsible for determining beneficiary eligibility and ensuring
      that claims are adjudicated properly. States mainly have issues with enrolled
      providers not appropriately screened by the state; providers not appropriately
      rescreened at revalidation; providers not enrolled; providers without the required
      NPI on the claim; enrolling a beneficiary when ineligible for Medicaid; determining
      a beneficiary to be eligible for the incorrect eligibility category, resulting
      in an ineligible service or incorrect federal reimbursement amount being provided;
      not conducting beneficiary redeterminations timely or at all; or not performing,
      completing, or providing sufficient documentation to support a required element
      of the eligibility determination process, such as income verification.

    Answer: States did not maintain documentation to support payment processing and

      independently verify risk based screening requirements around database checks
      to show that the provider would have been eligible for payment had the state
      maintained documentation to show the screening requirements had been completed
      in accordance with regulations. During eligibility reviews, CMS was able to
      independently verify certain eligibility requirements through review of information
      gathered around separate determinations (i.e., not a Medicaid/CHIP determination)
      for the beneficiary that provided reasonable support that the beneficiary was

      reviews to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage
      Organizations (MAOs) for risk-adjusted payments. HHS also performs audits of

      For example, in FY 2024, the primary drivers of the improper payment rate are
      Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), Hospital Outpatient, Inpatient Rehabilitation
      Facility (IRF), and Hospice claims. To drive down the improper payment rate,
      HHS continues nationwide prior authorization for hospital outpatient claims.
      Medicare review contractors continue to identify and prevent improper payments
      due to documentation errors in error-prone claim types, including SNF, hospital
      outpatient and IRF. HHS also revamped its hospice strategy to reduce the hospice
      error rate. HHS will continue to develop and prioritize additional CAPs in FY

    Answer: HHS will continue to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments and unknown payments
      agency-wide as evidenced by its lower error rate of 3.70%.  The actions taken
      and planned to address failure to access data are proportional to the improper
      payment rate and address the root causes of the improper payments. For example,
      HHS audits Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs and educate sponsors
      on fraud, waste, and abuse. These audits have varying scopes but share the goal
      of reducing and recovering improper Part D payments. Future audits may account
      for areas in which missing or invalid documentation has been found to be a persistent
      issue. HHS also uses education and outreach as a key tool to reduce improper
      payments. Annually, the agency identifies the root causes of improper payments
      and develops specific corrective actions to address them. This work is reported
      on through the AFR process.

    Answer: HHS reports the agency’s improper payment targets annually in the AFR.
      In addition, HHS sets annual Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals
      tied to reducing the improper payments. HHS managers are held accountable for
      assessing improper payment rates and taking meaningful steps to address the
      root causes of error. These efforts are reflected in each manager’s performance
      plan, as appropriate. HHS also reports quarterly on the specific actions taken
      to address the improper payment rates through the quarterly scorecard process

    Answer: A payment is considered “Unknown” when an agency is unable to obtain the
      documentation needed for a reviewer to determine whether the payment was made
      to the right recipient and/or for the right amount. Concerning FY24 UIP testing,
      HRSA had some “unknown payments” because health-care providers’ eligibility
      could not be verified due to the Tax Identification Number (TINs) per the sample
      data not matching the TINs in the supporting documentation, and HRSA could not
      determine if the payments were made the right health-care providers.

    Answer: Coupled with the historical records, HHS continues to work with the UIP

      assessments and has reprocessed claims that were incorrectly paid due to government
      error, such as internal adjudication or payment errors. Prior to the passage
      of the FRA, HHS had planned to reprocess claims that were underpaid as a result
      of the incorrect fee schedule used to pay certain services.
