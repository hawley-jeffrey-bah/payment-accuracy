    Description_Action_Taken: AmeriCorps had previously established a Payment Integrity
      Corrective Action Plan working group to address improper payment rates. This
      group identified the root cause drivers behind the improper and unknown payments.
      Based on this information, the group has created resources and delivered trainings
      focused on the identified improper payment root cause drivers. Those trainings
      are and have been available to grantees.  The agency also provided resolution
      packets to grantees at the conclusion of the FY 2024 assessment linking specific
      root cause drivers of improper payments to the corresponding applicable statute,
      regulation, and available trainings. This will continue for the FY 2025 assessment.

    Answer: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
      by grantees to support the selected federal expenses charged against the grant.
      There are situations where the grantee is unable to provide the required documentation
      to support the payment or the documentation provided is insufficient. In these
      situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation or
      adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as either
      proper or improper could have been made.

    Answer: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action
      plan group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group
      will be reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from
      offices across the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action
      plan development, the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary
      to reduce improper payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are
      made at the grantee level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control
      training to strengthen the control environment at the grantee level. Executive
      managers, programs, and other staff contribute to improper payment corrective
      action planning. Reduction in improper payments may be included in performance
      conversations for those accountable for the reduction.

    Answer: No resources were requested. The agency did not request resources because
      the payments are generally not made at the agency level and are made by individual
      grantees. Corrective actions to target grantees, such as trainings, can be developed
      and performed with resources available.

    Answer: The AmeriCorps Payment Integrity Assessment uses documentation submitted
      by grantees to support the selected federal expenses charged against the grant.
      There are situations where the grantee is unable to provide the required documentation
      to support the payment or the documentation provided is insufficient. In these
      situations, had the grantee been able to provide the missing documentation or
      adequately documented information a determination regarding the payment as either
      proper or improper could have been made.

      \ and FGP are made that the grantee level. The improper payments in ASN and\
      \ FGP are not made at the agency level and largely do not represent monetary\
      \ loss to the government. The majority are unknown payments for which the agencyâ€™s\
      \ grantees are unable to provide sufficient support documentation to determine\
      \ if the payment was proper or improper. Since the agency does not have direct\
      \ control over the payments, it has implemented updated trainings to ensure\
      \ the grantees have the requisite knowledge to appropriately support their payments.\n"

    Answer: The agency implemented an improper payment reduction corrective action
      plan group to develop actions to reduce the improper payments and this group
      will be reinstated in FY 2025. This group consisted of representatives from
      offices across the agency. Through root cause analysis and corrective action
      plan development, the agency is assessing where additional controls may be necessary
      to reduce improper payments. The improper payments reported for the agency are
      made at the grantee level, therefore the agency is developing an internal control
      training to strengthen the control environment at the grantee level. Executive
      managers, programs, and other staff contribute to improper payment corrective
      action planning. Reduction in improper payments may be included in performance
      conversations for those accountable for the reduction.

    Answer: No resources were requested. The agency did not request resources because
      the payments are generally not made at the agency level and are made by individual
      grantees. Corrective actions to target grantees, such as trainings, can be developed
      and performed with resources available.
