  Heading: List of Each Program That Was Determined To Not Be In Compliance

- Answer: 'The FY 2023 compliance audit identified six key areas of non-compliance,
    and the OIG provided recommendations for each, along with suggested actions and
    milestones by HHS to address the issues:


    1. CHIP''s Improper Payment Rate Exceeding 10%: The OIG recommended implementing
    more robust corrective action plans and providing technical assistance to states.
    HHS worked with states to create corrective action plans, combined with state
    flexibilities during the pandemic, resulting in CHIP''s improper payment rate
    dropping below 10%. HHS will continue to monitor compliance and work with states
    to address any emerging issues.


    2. Lack of Improper Payment Estimates for Risk-Susceptible Programs: The OIG advised
    that all programs identified as risk-susceptible should report improper payment
    estimates. HHS has begun addressing this by resuming measurement and reporting
    for the Foster Care program and launching the Improper Payment Pre-testing and
    Assessment program for State-based Exchanges. These efforts aim to establish more
    accurate and consistent reporting across all risk-susceptible programs.


    3. Limited Progress in Medicare Part C Payment Integrity: To improve payment integrity
    for Medicare Part C, the OIG recommended accelerating corrective actions and recovery
    audits. HHS responded by recovering overpayments from Medicare Part C''s Risk
    Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits, starting with payment year 2018. HHS
    plans to continue enhancing audit processes and refine corrective actions for
    future recovery efforts.


    4. Incomplete Risk Assessments for Programs with Outlays Over $10 Million: The
    OIG stressed the importance of conducting risk assessments for all such programs
    at least once every three years. In FY 2024, HHS significantly increased the number
    of programs assessed and plans to review all programs for significant improper
    payments by FY 2025, ensuring compliance with the three-year requirement.


    5. Delays in Medicare Part C Recovery Audits: The OIG recommended expediting the
    audit process for timely identification and recovery of improper payments. HHS
    has taken steps to finalize past RADV audits and will implement a more structured
    timeline for future audits to prevent delays.


    6. Methodology Issues in COVID-19 Uninsured Program Estimate: The OIG suggested
    refining the sampling and estimation methods to better capture program characteristics.
    HHS completed reporting for the COVID-19 Uninsured Program, providing a combined
    rate for the past two years of payments.


    These actions and planned milestones demonstrate HHS''s commitment to addressing
    the OIG''s recommendations and improving compliance with PIIA requirements.'
