- Answer: "The top root causes of Unemployment Insurance (UI) improper payments for\
    \ Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) 2023 (July 1, 2022 through June 30,\
    \ 2023), were: Benefit Year Earnings (BYE), Separation Issues, and Work Search.\
    \ \n\nThe frequency and complexity of fraud attacks, specifically identity (ID)\
    \ fraud, against state unemployment programs increased significantly during the\
    \ COVID-19 pandemic. A combination of decades of underfunding, outdated state\
    \ UI information technology (IT) systems, record claims volumes, and weaker integrity\
    \ controls in 2020, provided an opportunity for criminals to exploit vulnerabilities\
    \ in state UI systems, which resulted in elevated rates of improper payments.\
    \ State UI systems were, and continue to be, targeted by sophisticated and organized\
    \ fraud, perpetrated by domestic and international criminal organizations. While\
    \ states worked tirelessly to rapidly combat relentless fraud attacks, the fraud\
    \ schemes continue to evolve to circumvent prevention and detection tools and\
    \ strategies implemented by states. ETA and state UI agencies continue to work\
    \ collaboratively with the Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and\
    \ refer cases of UI fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct to the\
    \ Department’s OIG for investigation and prosecution.\n\nThe Department places\
    \ a heightened priority on program integrity and mitigating UI fraud risks. ETA\
    \ remains fully committed to reducing IPs and combatting fraud in the UI programs\
    \ and continues to make UI program integrity a top agency priority. In FY 2023,\
    \ the Department engaged in a fraud risk assessment project to ensure existing\
    \ fraud risk management activities are assessed, conducted, and evaluated in alignment\
    \ with the leading practices provided in the Government Accountability Office’s\
    \ (GAO) Fraud Risk Framework, which led to the documentation and development of\
    \ a UI Fraud Risk Profile.  ETA develops, updates, oversees, and communicates\
    \ UI antifraud strategies through a robust and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic\
    \ Plan, which continuously evolves and includes innovative strategies and antifraud\
    \ controls to combat emerging fraud schemes and address the highest residual risk\
    \ identified in the UI Fraud Risk Profile. ETA’s efforts to improve program integrity\
    \ in the unemployment compensation (UC) programs include providing guidance, technical\
    \ assistance, resources, and funding to support states in combatting fraud, strengthening\
    \ ID verification, reducing IPs, recovering overpayments, assessing and addressing\
    \ fraud risks, protecting victims of ID fraud, and evaluating data to ensure effectiveness\
    \ and equity in fraud prevention and detection efforts. The Department continues\
    \ to explore, research, identify, invest in, and provide states with new tools,\
    \ resources, strategies, and guidance to help states combat the continually changing\
    \ and new emerging types of sophisticated fraud impacting the UI system. For more\
    \ information on the Department’s UI antifraud strategy and actions to reduce\
    \ IPs in unemployment programs, please see the FY 2023 UI Integrity Strategic\
    \ Plan - https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/integrity_plan.asp\n\nState UI systems\

- Answer: "With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each\
    \ state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining\
    \ UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment,\
    \ and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments\
    \ for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of\
    \ New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity\
    \ Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases\
    \ such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such\
    \ as tips and leads.\n\nState UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states\
    \ are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing\
    \ recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection\
    \ and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments\
    \ established and recovered.\n\nStates are required to hold claimants liable to\
    \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper\
    \ payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds\
    \ and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must\
    \ be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities.  States\
    \ may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity\
    \ and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery\
    \ of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\
    \ Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment\
    \ Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances\
    \ may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.\n\nETA issued\
    \ UIPL No. 23-20 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity\
    \ functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment\
    \ compensation (UC) programs and consolidated, clarified, and expanded these activities\
    \ with the issuance of UIPL No. 11-23.   ETA requires states to use the overpayment\
    \ recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to\
    \ require such actions):\n•\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle\
    \ Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5\
    \ of UIPL No. 13- 20, Change 2);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable\
    \ covered debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);\n\
    •\tCross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\t\
    Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\n\
    ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery\
    \ activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment\
    \ recovery operation:\n•\tNegotiating repayment plans;\n•\tAccepting repayments\
    \ through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);\n•\tState Income\
    \ Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage garnishments;\n•\tProperty liens and assessments;\n\
    •\tOffsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;\n•\t\
    Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual\
    \ with an outstanding overpayment;\n•\tSkip tracing;\n•\tWork proactively and\
    \ collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity,\
    \ ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL\
    \ No. 19-21);\n•\tCivil actions;\n•\tCredit bureau referrals;\n•\tState/federal\
    \ prosecution;\n•\tPenalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state\
    \ and federal law; \n•\tCollection agency referrals when state staff is limited,\
    \ or debt is uncollectable by other means; \n•\tImplementing a voluntary fraud\
    \ self-disclosure program; and \n•\tOther recovery methods as determined by state\
    \ law or policy."

- Answer: State UI programs may write off an overpayment when they determine it as
    uncollectable. This means that all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted
    and the overpayment has been officially written off and/or authorized for removal
    from the active accounts receivable file and transferred to suspense (no further
    action to be taken).

- Answer: Prior to FY13, OCFO contracted with a recovery audit contractor - however
    that activity was determined not cost effective. This determination was reconfirmed

    excepting the Employment & Training Administration - Federal State Unemployment
    Insurance program which provides specific reporting in this DataCall and related
    Cares Act Benefit programs (PUA, FPUC, & PEUC) now expired in law.
