    Answer: The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data information.
      In order to fully mitigate these errors, program software will need to be modified,
      specifically to incorporate reading an applicant’s farm records to properly
      identify owners, operators, and other tenants and perform other cross checks
      to ensure the proper supporting documentation such as a lease or CCC-855 has
      been completed for the associated grazed acreage claimed.  Currently, Farm Service
      Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to enhance existing
      software.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit Corporation Section
      4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation budget
      request and Working Capital Fund request drills to support this effort.  Estimated
      funding requirements for this system enhancement is $2 million.

    Answer: The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data information.
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program is currently part of Farm Service Agency’s
      Internal Control roadmap to improve program processes.  1. Currently in development
      is an improper payment trend analysis tool that has Fiscal Year 2019-2023 improper
      payment data.  The tool will identify staff, county offices and states with
      continued improper payment findings.  The tool will allow the agency to target
      county offices and staff for targeted training along with holding employees
      accountable, if warranted after training has been provided.  2.  Standardized
      Training policy for Farm Programs is part of the internal control roadmap for
      Fiscal Year 2025.  Training guidance would provide standardization for Headquarters,
      State and County level training.

    Answer: "Serious Deficiency Proposed Rule\nThe Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)\
      \ anticipates that the Serious Deficiency (SD) Proposed Rule and companion application\
      \ will streamline the SD process and provide a user-friendly method for accurately\
      \ implementing the process. This will improve our method for identifying and\
      \ ultimately addressing SDs in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP).\n\
      Progress on CACFP Integrity Studies\nFNS is using the preliminary results of\
      \ the Erroneous Payments in Child Care Centers Study (EPICCS) as a base for\
      \ its Improper Payment (IP) estimates in CACFP centers. The study is pending\
      \ publication. In addition, FNS has continued to invest in the identification\
      \ of a feasible method for assessing meal claiming error in family daycare homes.\
      \ \nChild Nutrition (CN) Program Integrity Rule \nFNS expects the rule’s provisions\
      \ to strengthen the administration of CN programs, at all levels, through enhanced\
      \ oversight and enforcement tools designed to help FNS and State administering\
      \ agencies to reduce program error of all types, resulting in more efficient\
      \ operations and improved compliance with program requirements. Authorizing\

      \ and monitoring requirements and improve overall program management."

    Answer: As the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) receives the preliminary results,
      it will be able to review this first measure of program error since the COVID
      pandemic, when all meals were served free regardless of family income. Now that
      schools have returned to using the National School Lunch (NSLP) and School Breakfast
      Program (SBP) for determining household eligibility, serving healthy, nutritious
      meals, and claiming reimbursement for those meals, FNS is especially interested
      in Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV's results
      to help understand current NSLP/SBP operations as opposed to using pre-COVID
      improper payment baseline.

    Answer: 'To address improper payment associated with the inability to access/data
      information, RMA will conduct a program assessment of the Spot Check List procedures
      utilized and corrective actions carried out by the Approved Insurance Providers
      (AIPs). To execute this audit, RMA’s Northern Regional Compliance Office (NRCO)
      will obtain documentation used by the AIPs to conduct their reviews and support
      their determinations. Once obtained, the documentation will be reviewed to verify
      compliance with Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) policy and procedure.  The
      anticipated impact of this corrective action is to ensure that all AIPs are
      conducting Spot Check List reviews according to procedure.  In auditing AIP
      performance, RMA hopes to reduce potential program vulnerabilities, improper
      payments, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program.


      Improper payments associated with the failure to access data/information are
      often related to errors in which external stakeholders do not follow Federal
      Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)  policies and procedures.  To address these
      types of errors RMA’s Southern Regional Compliance Office (SRCO) will be conducting
      a Cotton Loss Adjustment Program Review.  This review will determine if AIPs
      are following approved FCIC loss adjustment procedures ensuring the accuracy
      of the indemnities being issued.'
