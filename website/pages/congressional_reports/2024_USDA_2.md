    Answer: 'The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data.
      The Farm Service Agency’s Internal Review Documentation and Tracking System
      officially records the results of internal program reviews. The Program Manager
      is able to review and analyze the data collected during a review and develop
      report findings. During meetings held with the State Executive Directors and
      State Office staff, Farm Service Agency’s Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs
      will communicate compliance updates.

      The updates can include the following:

      1.  Reports of internal and external compliance reviews.

      2.  A summary of the findings, including the types of errors found.

      3.  Corrective actions to be taken, as applicable.

      Program Managers will evaluate the progress of the corrective actions with timely
      follow-up and status updates of any corrective actions.

    Answer: The root cause of these improper payments was failure to access data information.
      In order to fully mitigate these errors, program software will need to be modified,
      specifically to incorporate reading an applicant’s farm records to properly
      identify owners, operators, and other tenants and perform other cross checks
      to ensure the proper supporting documentation such as a lease or CCC-855 has
      been completed for the associated grazed acreage claimed.  Currently, Farm Service
      Agency’s information technology budget is not adequately funded to enhance existing
      software.  Farm Service Agency will request Commodity Credit Corporation Section
      4 and 11 funding during the Fiscal Year 2025 Commodity Credit Corporation budget
      request and Working Capital Fund request drills to support this effort.  Estimated
      funding requirements for this system enhancement is $2 million.

    Answer: As the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) receives the preliminary results,
      it will be able to review this first measure of program error since the COVID
      pandemic, when all meals were served free regardless of family income. Now that
      schools have returned to using the National School Lunch (NSLP) and School Breakfast
      Program (SBP) for determining household eligibility, serving healthy, nutritious
      meals, and claiming reimbursement for those meals, FNS is especially interested
      in Access, Participation, Eligibility, and Certification (APEC) IV's results
      to help understand current NSLP/SBP operations as opposed to using pre-COVID
      improper payment baseline.

    Answer: The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has implemented several opportunities
      of training for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
      and Children (WIC). Annual training is provided on FNS’ National Management
      Evaluation (ME) guidance to regional office staff who conduct MEs. The goal
      of this training is to establish standards for FNS to effectively communicate
      findings and corrective action expectations to State agencies, to provide necessary
      technical assistance, and to support State agency program improvements. Additional
      WIC specific ME training is conducted throughout the year to support regional
      staff by holding bi-monthly meetings to discuss best practices and provide technical
      assistance, as well as specific technical assistance as needed to improve understanding
      and compliance of ME activities. Additional training is provided to State agencies
      through specific technical assistance during oversight activities. Training
      activities for State agency staff are further identified through the results
      of an annual target area report. This report looks at national trends of program
      integrity issues as well as programmatic deficiencies across all State agencies
      to issue technical assistance, policy memos, and training as needed. FNS has
      also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target
      improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources
      include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit
      on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool
      for assessing WIC Vendor Cost Neutrality.

    Answer: A prime example of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) implementing corrective
      actions is through WIC oversight. FNS uses management evaluations (MEs) as its
      primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing WIC State
      agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of
      WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance to State agencies
      and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2025-2027, FNS' ME target
      area for WIC is Food Delivery and Vendor Management. Food Delivery involves
      the security and accountability of food benefits, to include the process of
      managing and monitoring the disposition of all food benefits. Vendor management
      involves the ongoing management of selection, authorization, cost containment,
      training, monitoring, and sanctioning of vendors, to include claims against
      vendors as well as the conduct of vendor-related administrative appeal procedures.
      In addition to the ME target area, FNS also conducts a national risk-based ME
      assessment to identify State agencies with known program integrity issues. Program
      integrity issues include issues relating to improper payments, vendor management,
      certification/eligibility, fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary
      values risk to the Program. The target area supports the United States Department
      of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer
      service to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC
      Program through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS
      continues to analyze ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
      and integrity. This includes addressing certification and vendor issues that
      could result in improper payments.

    Answer: 'To address improper payment associated with the inability to access/data
      information, RMA will conduct a program assessment of the Spot Check List procedures
      utilized and corrective actions carried out by the Approved Insurance Providers
      (AIPs). To execute this audit, RMA’s Northern Regional Compliance Office (NRCO)
      will obtain documentation used by the AIPs to conduct their reviews and support
      their determinations. Once obtained, the documentation will be reviewed to verify
      compliance with Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) policy and procedure.  The
      anticipated impact of this corrective action is to ensure that all AIPs are
      conducting Spot Check List reviews according to procedure.  In auditing AIP
      performance, RMA hopes to reduce potential program vulnerabilities, improper
      payments, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program.


      Improper payments associated with the failure to access data/information are
      often related to errors in which external stakeholders do not follow Federal
      Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)  policies and procedures.  To address these
      types of errors RMA’s Southern Regional Compliance Office (SRCO) will be conducting
      a Cotton Loss Adjustment Program Review.  This review will determine if AIPs
      are following approved FCIC loss adjustment procedures ensuring the accuracy
      of the indemnities being issued.'
