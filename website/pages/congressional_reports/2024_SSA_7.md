- Answer: 'The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity
    Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY)
    2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory
    threshold, our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental
    Security Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security
    OIG concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements,
    but we did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements
    to payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment
    rate for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated,
    “While SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper
    payments, it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included
    the following recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments]
    alignment strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”


    We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our
    corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the
    OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we identify the root causes and
    evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally,
    we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes
    of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  IPAS
    is the process that we use to obtain agency wide engagement and agreement on actions
    needed to remedy improper payment issues.  In FY 2025, we will complete the IPAS
    for OASDI computations and draft a new IPAS on relationship.


    OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access
    data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or
    third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to
    accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information
    needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent
    these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures, and
    we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation
    solutions to improve accuracy when possible.  We will continue to improve technician
    tools and processes and strengthen our training to better equip our workforce.


    OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to
    access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party
    either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information
    necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these
    overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment.  To
    reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information,
    we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment
    information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information
    exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue
    to have a high payment accuracy rate.


    For the SSI program, of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately
    $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data
    or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist
    or is inaccessible to us.  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both
    overpayments and underpayments.  We will continue to improve notices to make it
    easier to understand.  As of September 30, 2024, as part of the SSI regulation
    simplification in-kind and maintenance updates, we removed a significant burden
    to report receipt of food assistance and reduced reporting burdens for individuals
    living in public assistance households.  Additionally, the expansion of the rental
    subsidy may increase the benefit amount some people are eligible to receive and
    will allow more people to qualify for critical SSI payments.


    Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages,
    we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment
    information from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February
    2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans
    for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper
    payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The
    public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering
    the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication
    in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting
    notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage
    and employment information from PIE doesn''t automatically post to the SSI record,
    requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through
    a phased approach after a final rule is published.  We continue to work on training,
    marketing, designing a phased approach, and updating policy in preparation for
    implementation.

- Answer: 'We hold managers, program officials, and senior executives accountable
    for reducing improper payments.  These employees’ annual performance plans reflect
    their responsibility to support efforts to maintain sufficient internal controls
    to prevent, detect, and recover improper payments and meet targets to reduce improper
    payments.


    Senior Executive performance plans must clearly align with organizational goals
    and objectives under the Results Driven Critical Element, and the performance
    levels in the performance requirements must reflect agency targets.


    To further our focus on reducing improper payments, in fiscal year 2019, we established
    an Improper Payments Prevention team in the Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight
    (OARO).  The team works with key agency stakeholders to develop Improper Payment
    Alignment Strategies that outline innovative and effective strategies to mitigate
    the root causes of improper payments.  We also reestablished the Deputy-Commissioner
    level Improper Payments Oversight Board (IPOB), which is responsible for reviewing,
    approving, and implementing all improper payment initiatives.  The Deputy Commissioner
    of OARO serves as the executive chair for the IPOB.
