- Answer: The OMB guidance addresses implementing payment recapture audits, for programs
    and activities that expend $1 million or more annually, provided it is cost-effective
    to do so. In accordance with the OMB guidance, the EEOC reviewed its programs
    and activities and determined that none of the agency’s programs or activities
    was susceptible to making significant improper payments and that the implementation
    of a payment recapture audit would not be cost-effective.
