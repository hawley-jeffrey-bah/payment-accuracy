- Answer: 'It was recommended that EEOC implement agency-wide Improper Payment Risk
    Assessment Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) based on OMB A-123 Appendix C guidance
    and identify a responsible point of contact for each significant program. The
    responsible party should report results of their risk assessment to the EEOC responsible
    official.   It was also recommended to implement an SOP to ensure annual compliance
    with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements.   The agency developed
    and implemented an agency-wide PIIA policy on December 28, 2023, to address compliance
    with OMB A-136 PIIA review and reporting requirements and risk assessment procedures.  The
    agency has also conducted an Improper Payment risk assessment of the Pay and Benefits
    (Payroll) Program and concluded that the Pay and Benefits (Payroll) Program is
    not susceptible to significant improper payments or unknown payments.  The agency
    will also report the results of the Pay and Benefits risk assessment in the agency''s
    financial report.
