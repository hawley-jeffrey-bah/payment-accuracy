- Answer: We have a robust, multi-faceted review process in place that is an effective
    approach for evaluating payment accuracy in the Railroad Retirement and Railroad
    Unemployment Insurance Act programs and identifying and preventing improper payments.  The
    RRB notified OMB of our approach in August 2011.  The agency is diligent in its
    recovery efforts for overpayments.  The agency conducts numerous quality assurance
    reviews focused on detecting improper payments in the vendor and employee payment
    programs.  The reviews constitute a robust monitoring program for improper payments
    and consistently return a zero percent error rate.  The most recent Fiscal Years
    (2022 and 2023) results concluded that there was no indication of improper payments.  In
    addition, we perform a bi-weekly review of payroll which includes a HR Links report
    of hours certified by surpervisors and a General Services Administration's report
    which identifies the payroll amount for the same period.  A comparison of the
    two reports is completed to verify that the two totals reconcile.  Based on the
    comparisons, results have not returned any indication of improper payments related
    to payroll.  Thus, no recapture audit program or alternative method for vendor
    and employee payments would be deemed cost effective as current management controls
    are proving effective.  Taken as a whole, our full range of current activities
    constitutes an effective alternative to a formal payment recapture program.  However,
    despite the agency's best efforts to prevent improper payments, some will always
    occur due to lack of timely information, etc.
