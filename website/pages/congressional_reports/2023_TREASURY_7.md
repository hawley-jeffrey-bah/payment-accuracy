- Answer: 'The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its payment program to an
    improper rate of less than 10 percent.  The IRS captures metrics related to pre-refund
    activities and works closely with internal and external partners to expand outreach
    efforts.  Many of these metrics are tied to the pre-refund examination program
    and are highly dependent on assumptions such as available staff. The Refund Integrity
    and Compliance Services (RICS) Director conducts quarterly operational reviews
    with Refundable Credits Examination Operations (RCEO) and Refundable Credits Program
    Management (RCPM) on the refundable credits program. The RICS and RCPM Directors
    and managers have performance plan commitments that address enhancements to the
    program such as increasing refundable credit awareness, encouraging eligible taxpayers
    to apply for those credits, and emphasizing tax return accuracy. As noted, taxpayers
    self-certify eligibility for refundable tax credits and that the return is accurate.


    The IRS performance plans also balance the outreach and awareness component with
    its examination program. Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer
    experience and improve the efficiencies in its processes and enhance case selection.  These
    plans are tied to management’s ratings ranging from Not Met to Outstanding and
    utilizes the SMART approach to ensure tangible results.'
