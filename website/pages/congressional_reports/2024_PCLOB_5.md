SurveyData:
- Answer: Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are subject
    to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for that
    month.  Invoices not processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) in
    excess of $2,500.00 are subject to secondary review before being paid.  Invoices
    under $2,500.00 are subject to review through statistical sampling procedures.  Travel
    vouchers processed through the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel system are
    subject to a post payment audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements
    under $2,500.   All payments of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population.
    These payments require a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed
    through the MoveLINQ system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review.   For
    payment customers, once the vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment,
    they are interfaced to Oracle the financial system where they are paid.
