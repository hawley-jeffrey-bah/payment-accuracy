    Answer: 'In May 2024, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program was determined
      to be susceptible to significant improper payments for the fiscal year 2023
      OMB A-123 assessment period. In response to the May 2024 determination, the
      Office of Capital Access (OCA) is evaluating options to address the potential
      and actual improper payments and any unknown payments in ERA. OCA is coordinating
      with Treasury''s Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer in establishing
      next steps for these programs, including timelines.


      In August 2022, Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these
      programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the
      root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors
      in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources.
      Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would
      not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report
      or on paymentaccuracy.gov. In addition, because the ERA program has concluded
      almost all of its disbursements, there is no basis for improper payment estimates
      going forward.'

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Additional
      Child Tax Credit (ACTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next filing
      season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune criteria
      used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from prior
      filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters, the
      IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. Due to the taxpayer’s
      misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility requirements,
      especially for self-employment or other income not reported to the IRS by third-parties,
      and reliance on taxpayer self-certification, errors (both unintentional and
      intentional) can occur. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting helps to
      mitigate the refundable tax credits improper payment primary root causes (1)
      data/information needed does not exist at the point of return filing and (2)
      inability to access data/information at the time the return is filed. Improved
      compliance filters can identify non-compliance issues after returns are filed
      but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary
      result of this effort enhances allocating resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur.

    Action_Type: Cross Enterprise Sharing
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements
      with the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and the Social Security
      Administration (SSA) to access critical information that aids in validating
      eligibility for the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). This data-sharing involves
      the exchange of key data points, such as income verification, household composition
      and income limits and the eligibility to claim certain dependents. With this
      information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether taxpayers meet the eligibility
      requirements for the ACTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing allows the IRS to detect
      discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as misreported income or invalid dependent
      claims, and prevent improper payments during the return processing stage. Another
      root cause of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) is taxpayer
      misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility requirements. Given that RTCs
      rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information, taxpayers may inaccurately
      claim the ACTC due to misunderstanding income limits or dependency. By leveraging
      third-party data sources from OCSE and SSA, the IRS can verify key elements
      of returns. This is especially important given the lack of a pre-approval process
      for these credits. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts to further its strategic
      initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer outreach and education,
      in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits. By helping taxpayers file
      accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring
      taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible, the
      IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially increasing the
      burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Accountability: "The IRS has a strong internal control environment around refundable\
      \ credit programs administered and makes decisions based on overall cost-benefit\
      \ considerations.  The IRS annually reviews and enhances its refundable credits\
      \ compliance plan that addresses erroneous claims.  Each year the IRS updates\
      \ its strategy using the most recent research findings, prior year audit results,\
      \ TIGTA/GAO audit findings and legislative updates.  The IRS also submits legislative\
      \ proposals which, if approved by Congress, may further enhance efforts to address\
      \ areas of risk and reduce improper payments. \n \nThe IRS reviews and updates\
      \ Internal Revenue Manuals throughout the year and ensures that IRS employees\
      \ who administer refundable credits receive annual training and have the requisite\
      \ knowledge to address the evolving nature of improper payments and fraud. \
      \ Employees are also encouraged to recommend changes that may further strengthen\
      \ the IRS's internal controls and procedures.\n \nThe IRS performance plans\
      \ also balance the outreach and awareness component with its examination program.\
      \ Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve\
      \ the knowledge of taxpayers and paid return preparers of the eligibility and\
      \ criteria for RTCs.\n\nReducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent\
      \ would require significant restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative\
      \ action."
    Needs1: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
      (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Inspector
      General of Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported that the issue
      with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
    Needs2: "Further improving the integrity of RTC programs will take actions beyond\
      \ the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) control. The IRS has proposed various\
      \ legislative changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools\
      \ for managing RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration\
      \ included the following proposals in its Budget submission: \n\n1. Expand and\
      \ increase Penalties for Return Preparation and E-filing - The proposal would\
      \ increase and expand the IRS’s authority to address noncompliance or inappropriate\
      \ behavior by paid tax return preparers and e-file providers.  First, it would\
      \ increase the penalty amounts that apply to paid tax return preparers for willful,\
      \ reckless or unreasonable understatements, as well as for forms of noncompliance\
      \ that do not involve an understatement of tax.  Second, the proposal would\
      \ establish new penalties for the appropriation of Preparer Tax Identification\
      \ Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification Numbers (EFINs) and for\
      \ failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.  Third, the proposal\
      \ would increase the limitations period during which the penalty for a failure\
      \ to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be assessed from three years\
      \ to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify the Secretary’s authority\
      \ to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons who participate in the\
      \ authorized e-file program, including setting standards and imposing sanctions\
      \ to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\n2. Increase Oversight\
      \ of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend Title 31, U.S. Code\
      \ (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit authority to regulate\
      \ all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including by establishing mandatory\
      \ minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory changes may help reduce\
      \ RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful reduction in the estimated\
      \ error rate is unlikely without independent data sources through which the\
      \ IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and additional time and resources\
      \ for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    Sufficiency: 'The primary challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs),
      such as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), is the complexity of the credits''
      statutory eligibility requirements.  The fundamental root causes of the Additional
      Child Tax Credit improper payments are as follows: (1) there is a statutory
      lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale deny
      payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims
      of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data
      source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer
      self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed
      within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement.
      At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a)
      there is an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series
      of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing
      many nuances); (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported,
      particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported
      to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayer who receive
      certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements
      of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does
      not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math
      authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes a number
      of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility
      rules and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings,
      collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education
      efforts aid the IRS in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the
      IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: TREASURY
    Answer: The overpayments outside of the agency control include the inability to
      authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      also include the inability to authenticate data due to program design limitations.
      Barriers caused by program design occur when information needed to confirm payment
      accuracy is not available at the time the return is processed.

    Needs1: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
      (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Treasury
      Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported
      that the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
    Needs2: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs\
      \ will take actions beyond our control.  We have proposed various legislative\
      \ changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing\
      \ RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the\
      \ following proposals: \n\n1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation\
      \ and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority\
      \ to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers\
      \ and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply\
      \ to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements,\
      \ as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement\
      \ of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation\
      \ of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\
      \ Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.\
      \  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the\
      \ penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be\
      \ assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify\
      \ the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons\
      \ who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards\
      \ and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\
      \n2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend\
      \ Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit\
      \ authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including\
      \ by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory\
      \ changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
      \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data\
      \ sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and\
      \ additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    Sufficiency: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is
      that RTCs do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The
      fundamental root cause of RTC improper payments are as follows: (1) there is
      a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability to wholesale
      deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify taxpayer claims
      of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any third-party data
      source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the IRS to rely on taxpayer
      self-certification that all return information is accurate. RTCs are managed
      within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration and enforcement.
      At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of filing/payment: (a)
      there is an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically due to a series
      of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency tests containing
      with many nuances); (b) there are instances where taxpayer income is misreported,
      particularly related to self-employment income and other income not reported
      to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there is turnover of taxpayers who receive
      certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex requirements
      of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally does
      not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of math
      authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes a number
      of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of compliance with eligibility
      rules and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings,
      collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies, and outreach/education
      efforts aid the IRS in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly, the
      IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'

    Answer: These overpayments outside of agency control include the inability to
      authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      outside of agency control also include the inability to authenticate data due
      to program design limitations. Barriers caused by program design occur when
      information needed to confirm payment accuracy is not available at the time
      the return is processed.

    Answer: The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) became refundable only
      for Tax Year (TY) 2021, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), as
      part of the COVID-19 pandemic assistance programs. The changes to the CDCTC
      were temporary, applying only to TY 2021. The short-term nature of this program
      limits the IRS’s ability to calculate improper payment estimates. To generate
      an improper payment estimate, the IRS needs to conduct comprehensive audits
      over a large sample of tax returns, requiring at least three years’ worth of
      data to ensure accuracy. However, because ARPA’s changes to the CDCTC were limited
      to TY 2021, there isn’t enough time or data to create an estimate before the
      refundable nature of this program ends. Accordingly, the credit has no basis
      for improper payment estimates. In August 2022 Treasury determined that due
      to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate
      of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action
      plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and
      be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief
      programs Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either
      in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. However, these programs
      will remain on the three-year risk assessment rotation.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS
      refines the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods
      of errors; this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the
      process. As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit
      management, the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper
      payments are reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and
      the lack of a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove
      their eligibility for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional)
      can occur. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.
      The primary result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas
      in which errors are most likely to occur. The IRS is re-aligning its efforts
      to further its strategic initiatives; accordingly, the IRS is investing in taxpayer
      outreach and education, in lieu of conducting additional pre-refund audits.
      By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront, quickly fixing errors that
      delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which
      they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy issues without substantially
      increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Earned
      Income Tax Credit (EITC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next
      filing season. This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune
      criteria used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from
      prior filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters,
      the IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and
      prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned,
      throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary
      root causes of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) are reliance
      on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval
      process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs
      upfront (as would be the case with a traditional payment program), errors can
      occur due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of
      eligibility. Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns
      are filed but before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to leverage data-sharing agreements
      with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services (CMS) to access critical information that aids in validating
      eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit (PTC). This data-sharing involves the
      exchange of key data points, such as income thresholds and enrollment in a qualified
      health plan. With this information, the IRS can more accurately assess whether
      taxpayers meet the eligibility requirements for the PTC. Cross Enterprise Sharing
      allows the IRS to detect discrepancies in taxpayer filings, such as the taxpayer
      not being in a qualified health plan and prevent improper payments during the
      return processing stage. An additional root cause of improper payments of refundable
      tax credits (RTCs), in addition to data needed does not exist and inability
      to access data, is taxpayer misreporting or misunderstanding of eligibility
      requirements. Given that RTCs rely heavily on taxpayer self-reported information,
      taxpayers may inaccurately claim the PTC due to misunderstanding income limits
      or dependency. By leveraging third-party data sources from CMS, the IRS can
      verify key elements of returns. This is especially important given the lack
      of a pre-approval process for these credits.

    Action_Type: Change Process
    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database
      (DDb) meetings with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self
      Employed, and Information Technology divisions, to review and adjust the value
      of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the
      Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Based on analysis of prior-year data, the IRS refines
      the IRS filters to better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors;
      this helps prevent improper payments by intervening earlier in the process.
      As mentioned, throughout the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management,
      the primary root causes of refundable tax credit-related improper payments is
      reliance on taxpayer self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of
      a pre-approval process. Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility
      for RTCs upfront, errors (both unintentional and intentional) can occur. Improved
      compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but before
      payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary result
      of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which errors
      are most likely to occur. By helping taxpayers file accurate returns upfront,
      quickly fixing errors that delay refunds and ensuring taxpayers claim the credits
      and deductions for which they are eligible, the IRS will correct payment accuracy
      issues without substantially increasing the burden on taxpayers and the IRS.

    Description_Action_Taken: The IRS held its annual Dependent Database (DDb) meeting
      with stakeholders in Taxpayer Services, Small Business & Self Employed, and
      IT divisions, to evaluate the effectiveness of prior-year compliance filters
      and enhance future filters for audit selection of returns claiming the Premium
      Tax Credit (PTC) and to identify improvement opportunities for next filing season.
      This process involves analyzing data from prior years to fine-tune criteria
      used to flag potentially erroneous returns. For example, patterns from prior
      filing seasons can reveal common errors, and by refining the IRS filters, the
      IRS can better prioritize returns with higher likelihoods of errors and prevent
      improper payments by intervening earlier in the process. As mentioned, throughout
      the IRS's history of refundable tax credit management, the primary root causes
      of improper payments of refundable tax credits (RTCs) are reliance on taxpayer
      self-certification of an accurate return and the lack of a pre-approval process.
      Because taxpayers are not required to prove their eligibility for RTCs upfront
      (as would be the case with a traditional payment program), errors can occur
      due to taxpayer misrepresentation or misunderstanding of key points of eligibility.
      Improved compliance filters can catch these issues after returns are filed but
      before payments are issued, helping to reduce improper payments. The primary
      result of this approach is enhanced targeting of resources to areas in which
      errors are most likely to occur.

      \ also balance the outreach and awareness component with its examination program.\
      \ Again, the IRS looks to find ways to enhance the taxpayer experience and improve\
      \ the knowledge of taxpayers and paid return preparers of the eligibility and\
      \ criteria for RTCs.\n\nReducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent\
      \ would require significant restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative\
      \ action."
    Needs1: 'The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Refundable Tax Credits
      (RTCs) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with RTCs is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around RTCs and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff whose tenure far exceeds that of other agencies. The Treasury
      Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has traditionally reported
      that the issue with improper payments is not an internal control deficiency.


      Reducing the improper payment rate to less than 10 percent would require significant
      restructuring of the RTC programs, to include legislative action.'
    Needs2: "Further improving the integrity of refundable tax credit (RTC) programs\
      \ will take actions beyond our control.  We have proposed various legislative\
      \ changes over the years aimed at providing more effective tools for managing\
      \ RTCs.  For the FY 2025 budget submission, the Administration included the\
      \ following proposals:\n\n1. Expand and increase Penalties for Return Preparation\
      \ and E-filing - The proposal would increase and expand the IRS’s authority\
      \ to address noncompliance or inappropriate behavior by paid tax return preparers\
      \ and e-file providers.  First, it would increase the penalty amounts that apply\
      \ to paid tax return preparers for willful, reckless or unreasonable understatements,\
      \ as well as for forms of noncompliance that do not involve an understatement\
      \ of tax.  Second, the proposal would establish new penalties for the appropriation\
      \ of Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTINs) and Electronic Filing Identification\
      \ Numbers (EFINs) and for failing to disclose the use of a paid tax return preparer.\
      \  Third, the proposal would increase the limitations period during which the\
      \ penalty for a failure to furnish the preparer’s identifying number may be\
      \ assessed from three years to six years.  Fourth, the proposal would clarify\
      \ the Secretary’s authority to regulate the conduct and suitability of persons\
      \ who participate in the authorized e-file program, including setting standards\
      \ and imposing sanctions to protect the integrity of the e-file program.  \n\
      \n2. Increase Oversight of Paid Tax Return Preparers - The proposal would amend\
      \ Title 31, U.S. Code (Money and Finance) to provide the Secretary with explicit\
      \ authority to regulate all paid preparers of federal tax returns, including\
      \ by establishing mandatory minimum competency standards. \n\nThese statutory\
      \ changes may help reduce RTC errors to some degree.  However, a meaningful\
      \ reduction in the estimated error rate is unlikely without independent data\
      \ sources through which the IRS can verify taxpayer-provided information and\
      \ additional time and resources for the IRS to address any issues identified."
    Sufficiency: 'The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is
      that RTCs do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The
      fundamental root causes of the Premium Tax Credit improper payments are as follows:
      (1) there is a statutory lack of a required pre-approval process; (2) an inability
      to wholesale deny payments (refunds) and (3) the information needed to verify
      taxpayer claims of eligibility belongs primarily to the taxpayer without any
      third-party data source available at the time of filing, thus requiring the
      IRS to rely on taxpayer self-certification that all return information is accurate.
      RTCs are managed within and follow the regulatory scheme of tax administration
      and enforcement. At a lower level, the root causes are that, at the time of
      filing/payment: (a) there''s an inability to authenticate eligibility (typically
      due to a series of complex eligibility rules, many with relationship and residency
      tests containing with many nuances); (b) there''s instances where taxpayer income
      is misreported, particularly related to self-employment income and other income
      not reported to the IRS by a third party; and (c) there''s a turnover of taxpayer
      who receive certain credits for the first time and fail to understand the complex
      requirements of claiming the credit. Pursuant to federal statute, the IRS generally
      does not have the capability to deny even incorrect claims, given the lack of
      math authority. However, the IRS''s information technology platform includes
      a number of filters that the IRS uses to monitor the accuracy of eligibility
      rules compliance and payment certification. The annual Dependent Database (DDb)
      meetings, collaborations/data sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education
      efforts aid the Service in mitigating the impact of these root causes. Lastly,
      the IRS has a number of outreach and education programs in place, to help taxpayers
      and tax preparers understand the program eligibility rules and file accurate
      returns claiming RTCs.'

    Answer: These overpayments outside of the agency control include the inability
      to authenticate data, primarily because the data does not exist.  Authentication
      is difficult because the IRS relies primarily on self-reported information from
      taxpayers, and there is a lack of internal or external databases available with
      information that would help the IRS determine eligibility.  These overpayments
      outside of the agency control also include the inability to authenticate data
      due to program design limitations. Barriers caused by program design occur when
      information needed to confirm payment accuracy is not available at the time
      the return is processed.
