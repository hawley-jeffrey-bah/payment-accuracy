Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The Department enhanced its methodology to assess the fraud
    risk factor in FY 2023. We added flexibility that enables DOT programs and activities
    to tailor the fraud risk factor by fraud schemes and other program-specific characteristics.
    The new approach encourages program officials to gain a better understanding of
    their vulnerabilities by 'thinking like a fraudster.' The remaining risk factors
    for our qualitative improper payment risk assessment remained the same as prior
    years.
