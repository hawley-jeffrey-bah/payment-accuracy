SurveyData:
- Answer: The agency employs various methods to recover improper payments identified
    in recovery audits. For Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS), CMS issues a demand letter,
    and the amount owed can be offset from future payments or refunded directly by
    the provider. For Medicare Part C, contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation
    (RADV) audits are used to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare
    Advantage Organizations, with overpayments recovered based on audit findings.
    In Medicare Part D, improper payments are identified through audits focusing on
    high-risk and high-cost drugs, and sponsors must recoup payments unless supporting
    documentation is provided. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Recovery Audit Contractor
    issues demand letters to debtors, with interest accruing on unresolved balances,
    and may refer debts to the Department of the Treasury if not resolved.
