      Care and Development Fund program include continuing to provide targeted technical
      assistance based on the reported specific causes of errors for the states. Some
      states reporting in FY 2024 have planned corrective actions that include fixing
      system errors and implementing new, enhanced systems; providing guidance, training,
      and technical assistance to eligibility staff; reviewing and updating policies
      and procedures manuals and providing policy clarifications to eligibility staff;
      meeting with state eligibility agencies to discuss errors; and continuing audit,
      monitoring, and review efforts.

    Answer: HHS’s corrective actions include identifying and remediating system defects
      within the Exchanges that may impact APTC payments.  These defects become known
      through various mechanisms, including internal quality control activities and
      external reviews of APTC eligibility determinations made by the Exchanges. HHS
      continually evaluates the policies and procedures that underlie the automated
      processes associated with APTC to identify and address weaknesses that may surface
      as they become operationalized.  HHS also proactively improves its automated
      processes, e.g., the Verify Lawful Presence service with the Department of Homeland
      Security was upgraded to ensure more accurate and timely lawful presence verifications.
      HHS implemented process automation to reduce human error introduced during adjudication
      and processing of supporting documentation.  HHS will continue to encourage
      and require that additional tasks be automated to further reduce manual errors
      and improve the accuracy and quality of required adjudication tasks. HHS plans
      to continue these actions in FY 2025 but will not finalize this decision until
      the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: Both the automated and the manual processes of the Exchanges are subject
      to rigorous annual testing of key internal controls as required by Appendix
      C of OMB Circular A-123.  External audits by OIG and GAO are another common
      mechanism that help to identify potential payment integrity risks within the
      Exchanges, specifically by evaluating APTC eligibility determinations made by
      the Exchanges within the context of federal statute and regulations. HHS plans
      to continue these actions in FY 2025, but will not finalize this decision until
      the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

    Answer: The Marketplace Program Integrity Contractor implemented a risk model
      that incorporates many risk factors that may indicate potential fraud or misconduct
      by agents or brokers.  The result is a risk profile and weighted risk score
      for each agent or broker.  Those that pose the highest risk, based on weighted
      risk score, are prioritized for investigations.  The risk profile is also leveraged
      as part of a prioritized investigation and significant discoveries may be used
      to inform interview questions or as supporting evidence in overall case findings.
      HHS plans to continue these actions in FY 2025, but will not finalize this decision
      until the APTC Error Rate data analysis is complete.

SurveyData:
- Answer: The agency employs various methods to recover improper payments identified
    in recovery audits. For Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS), CMS issues a demand letter,
    and the amount owed can be offset from future payments or refunded directly by
    the provider. For Medicare Part C, contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation
    (RADV) audits are used to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare
    Advantage Organizations, with overpayments recovered based on audit findings.
    In Medicare Part D, improper payments are identified through audits focusing on
    high-risk and high-cost drugs, and sponsors must recoup payments unless supporting
    documentation is provided. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Recovery Audit Contractor
    issues demand letters to debtors, with interest accruing on unresolved balances,
    and may refer debts to the Department of the Treasury if not resolved.
