  - Agency: TREASURY
    Answer: The IRS will continue to hold the annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings
      with stakeholders in the Wage & Investment, Small Business & Self Employed,
      and IT divisions, with the goal of increasing voluntary taxpayer compliance,
      to evaluate the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of
      (1) the inability to authenticate eligibility; (2) taxpayer income misreporting
      related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported
      to the IRS by a third party; and (3) the many taxpayers who claim and receive
      EITC for the first time, who have to understand and apply the complex eligibility
      requirements. The IRS will analyze returns claiming the EITC and identify improvement
      opportunities for next filing season.

SurveyData:
- Answer: 'Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are subject
    to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for that
    month. Invoices not processed through the IPP in excess of $2,500.00 are subject
    to secondary review before being paid. Invoices under $2,500.00 are subject to
    review through statistical sampling procedures. Travel vouchers processed through
    the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel system are subject to a post payment
    audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements under $2,500. All payments
    of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population. These payments require
    a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed through the MoveLINQ
    system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review. For payment customers,
    once the vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment, they are interfaced
    to Oracle, the financial system, through which they are paid.


    The DNP portal implementation has provided a way for our procurement and payable
    offices to review vendor files prior to disbursement. It has also given us an
    opportunity to review the monthly payment file results to identify any improper
    payments made to a vendor in the DNP portal.'
