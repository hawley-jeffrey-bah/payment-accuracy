    Answer: "For the agency's Grants program, overpayments occur when a recipient\
      \ erroneously overdraws funds in advance of immediate cash needs or uses funds\
      \ for unallowable costs. \nThe EPA seeks to prevent improper payments through\
      \ mechanisms such as:  (Prior to the issuance of a grant award,) the agency’s\
      \ Compliance Team conduct pre-award certification of non-profit recipients that\
      \ receive awards in excess of $200K to ensure their written policies and procedures\
      \ specify acceptable internal controls for safeguarding federal funds. Re-certifications\
      \ are conducted every four years. Grants Management Officers (GMOs) concur on\
      \ all certifications. EPA conducts annual baseline monitoring reviews of all\
      \ recipients to ensure overall compliance with assistance agreement terms and\
      \ conditions, as well as all applicable federal regulations. If deemed necessary,\
      \ recipients can be placed on a reimbursement payment plan which requires submission\
      \ of cost documentation (receipts, invoices, etc.) for review and approval prior\
      \ to receiving reimbursement."

    Answer: 'The agency anticipates the steps taken in FY 2024 along with the planned
      activities in the forthcoming fiscal year will be adequate. As the agency Grants
      Program has a combined improper payment questioned cost rate below the 1.5%
      threshold rate, no additional efforts are planned.

      How the corrective action plan affects "unknown payments" is not certain because
      the agency did not have any this year.'
