- Answer: 'The Commission determined that implementing a payment recapture audit program
    for contract payments is not cost-effective. In making this determination, the
    Commission considered its low improper payment rate based on testing conducted
    over the previous three years and determined that the costs of implementing and
    overseeing a payment recapture audit program, including staff time and payments
    to contractors, would exceed any benefits or recaptured amounts that might result.


    The Commission utilizes cost-efficient matching techniques to review all vendor
    payments to identify significant overpayments at a low cost per overpayment. The
    Commission has not identified a significant number or amount of improper payments
    since it began its analysis. In addition to contract payments, recapture auditing
    may also be considered for the Commission’s monetary awards to whistleblowers,
    if determined to be cost-effective, when payments to whistleblowers total more
    than $10 million annually. The amount of whistleblower awards will vary depending
    on the number and amount of covered enforcement actions in a given year, as well
    as the extent of original information provided by whistleblowers that led to the
    actions. However, the Commission has determined that implementing a payment recapture
    audit program for monetary awards to whistleblowers would not be cost-effective
    due to the effective design and operation of the internal controls in place for
    the program.


    As noted above, the review of each individual award by the Commission’s Claims
    Review Staff and multiple approval levels limit the likelihood that the whistleblower
    award program would be susceptible to significant improper payments or that payment
    recapture audits would be beneficial.


    The Commission will continue to monitor the potential for improper payments across
    all programs and activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment
    recapture audits for each program would be cost-effective.'
