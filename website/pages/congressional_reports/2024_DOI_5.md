SurveyData:
- Answer: In FY 2014, the DOI conducted payment recapture audits for payments made
    in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 that resulted in a recapture rate of 0.0004
    percent. Based on the low rate of improper payments, DOI concluded that the cost
    of executing a payment recapture audit program outweighed the benefits of finding
    and recovering erroneous payments. The staff resources needed to conduct the program,
    sustain the contract, and oversee vendor payments were a significant drain on
    limited agency resources with minimal benefits to the government. In April 2014,
    OMB was notified that DOI discontinued the payment recapture audit program. The
    DOI continues to have a low improper payment rate and circumstances have not changed
    within our programs to make a payment recapture audit cost effective. As such,
    DOI did not perform recapture audits for improper payments this fiscal year. The
    DOI will continue complying with PIIA through the OMB Circular A-123 process as
    a more cost effective and efficient use of agency resources to identify, reduce,
    and recover improper payments.
