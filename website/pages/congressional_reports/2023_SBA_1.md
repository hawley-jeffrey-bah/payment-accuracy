  AdditionalInformation: To ensure that the updates made in FY 2023 to the qualitative
    risk assessment did not materiality impact the results of the risk assessments
    completed in FY 2022, the SBA conducted risk assessment mock-ups for every single
    program that was risk assessed in FY 2022 to determine if the new risk assessment
    made a material difference in the risk rating for those programs.  Of the total
    risk assessments completed in FY 2022, only two programs had a difference in the
    risk assessment results - the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program and the Shuttered
    Venue Operators Grant program.  In anticipation of the potential risk of improper
    payments within these two programs, the SBA proactively conducted improper payment
    testing on a statistical sample of the outlays for these two programs, and are
    reporting improper payment estimates for these two programs in FY 2023.
