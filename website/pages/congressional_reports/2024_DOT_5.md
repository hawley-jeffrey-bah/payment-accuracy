SurveyData:
- Answer: Grant payments continue to represent the greatest proportion of overpayments
    identified through the recovery audit. DOT attributes the cause for grant-related
    overpayments to administrative errors made by entities external to the Department.
    In particular, administrative errors made by grant recipients identified when
    closing grant agreements funded by COVID relief sources. Since FY 2021, DOT has
    sought to conduct quantitative improper payment risk assessments (Phase 1) of
    COVID relief payments along with our annual estimates (Phase 2). The reviews reinforce
    DOT program oversight controls over relief funds administered by grant recipients
    and provide targeted actions for identified errors. The recovery audit provides
    an additional layer of detective controls to assess and confirm whether DOT’s
    improper payments remain within tolerable ranges.

- Answer: Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed the recovery
    audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2023 through March 2024. DOT
    considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal year 2024 audit to be
    recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s service provider, typically
    recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly from the payee, by offsetting
    a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt to the Department of Treasury’s
    Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover overpayments directly from the
    payees. In fiscal year 2024, recaptured overpayments resulting from DOT errors
    were returned to the program or activity’s original purpose.
