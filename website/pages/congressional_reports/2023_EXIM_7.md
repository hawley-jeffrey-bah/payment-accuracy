- Answer: 'Executive managers are held accountable through regular performance appraisal
    for establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls, including an appropriate
    control environment, that effectively prevents improper payments from being made
    and promptly prevent and detect improper payments. EXIM incorporates into regular
    performance reviews an evaluation of how each individual has contributed to creating
    an appropriate workplace environment in line with the entity’s values and its
    Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and create incentives through the evaluation
    of its employee’s annual performance.


    EXIM annual performance elements include a goal on “Protect U.S. Taxpayers Through
    Good Governance” written into employee performance plans and appraisals. Good
    governance would include ensuring compliance with PIIA while establishing procedures
    and assessments which would prevent or mitigate any agency improper payments.
    In addition, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics contains clauses related
    to commitment related to professionalism and behavior maintaining the highest
    standards of integrity, accountability, stewardship, commitment to excellence,
    customer focus, and innovation in their work.
