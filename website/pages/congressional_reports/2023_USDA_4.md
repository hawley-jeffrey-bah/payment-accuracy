    Answer: Statutory requirements of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program were
      not met due to program requirements of completing re-delegation of authority
      to County Executive Director, obtaining approval signatures and collecting payment
      eligibility documentation.  Agency determined that findings associated with
      proper approval authority caused the largest percentage of improper payments.  In
      addition, transactions were determined improper due to a lack of payment eligibility
      documents not filed or not timely filed according to policy requirements.

    Answer: The Farm Service Agency administers all of its programs within the agency.
      Livestock Forage Disaster Program overpayments within the agency’s control are
      the result of Failure to access data/information.  The overpayments are due
      to County Office staff did not adhere to first level controls to prevent improper
      payments to ensure the correct carrying capacity is used for the specific forage
      and pasture type.  To prevent the improper payments for occurring, District
      Directors are required to review the first five program applications received
      in the Service Center.  Farm Service Agency has implemented a SharePoint system
      in fiscal year 2023 for those reviews to be documented and to report any identified
      program weaknesses to the National Office.  The agency's National Office Program
      Manager will monitor the SharePoint system to proactively identify any program
      weakness throughout the current program year application period.

      post Coronavirus Disease of 2019.  There are multiple acreage reporting deadlines
      throughout the year depending on the crop.  Due to the many acreage reporting
      deadlines in county offices, additional emphasis on accountability is necessary
      and will be communicated to state offices through acreage reporting training
      tentatively scheduled for fiscal year 2024.

    Description_Action_Taken: 'The majority of incorrect acreage findings were related
      to grazing acres. Many factors determine animal units and if determined incorrectly,
      or data is erroneously entered in the worksheet or payment software, the payment

      was conducted during agency’s call with State Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance
      Program specialists to instruct them on accurately converting animal units into
      payment acres in the Grass for Grazing worksheet.

      Determining a crop’s production can be complex. Production may include, or be
      a combination of, harvested, appraised, and assigned production of a crop within
      a county, which may also include production from multiple farms with multiple
      fields. If one of the three types are determined incorrectly, the sum of the
      three will be incorrect, leading to an improper payment.  Training on how to
      determine production was provided in January 2023 in Dallas TX.'

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program does not have sufficient resources
      to add needed internal controls, human resources, and information systems to
      reduce the improper payment and unknown payments.  Noninsured Crop Disaster
      Assistance Program leverages the existing internal controls environment and
      accountability processes to provide reasonable assurances that internal controls
      are in place and operating effectively.  A continuous evaluation system which
      monitors the effectiveness of internal controls is in place but is not sufficient
      to reduce improper payments rates.
    Needs2: The fiscal year 2024 President’s Budget and the fiscal year 2025 Department
      Estimates submitted to Office of Management and Budget does not include funding
      levels to support the required software enhancements to increase application
      controls.  Due to budget constraints for the agency approved funding levels,
      the funding required to build automated internal controls within the existing

    Needs1: Given the highly decentralized nature of the Child and Adult Care Food
      Program (CACFP), it is cost prohibitive for Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
      to calculate annual improper payment rates and dollar values using a census
      approach. Instead, FNS must rely on estimates developed through periodic studies.
      FNS has developed a measurement methodology for the Family Day Care Home (FDCH)
      Tiering Decision component of the program and is in the process of measuring
      errors or determining the feasibility of measuring errors in the remaining components
      - Child Care Centers and Adult Day Care Facilities. Because requirements vary
      significantly by program component, a full and rigorous assessment of the rate
      of improper payments is extremely complex. FNS continues to explore alternative
      methodologies for developing a reliable measurement for the FDCH Tiering Decision
      meal claims component. FNS has also completed data collection on a study to
      measure program error in childcare centers. FNS is committed to ensuring integrity
      in CACFP in order to protect taxpayer dollars and safeguard the meals that millions
      of children rely on at child care. Therefore, FNS is reporting that it has not
      yet determined a tolerable rate for CACFP that fully balances payment integrity
      risk and controls while executing the program's processes to maximum possible
      effect as allowed under statute.
    Needs2: "In order to establish and maintain internal controls in the Child and\
      \ Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has requested\
      \ the following budget increases to the Child Nutrition Block, of which CACFP\
      \ is included (Source:  2023 USDA Explanatory Notes - Food and Nutrition Service):\
      \ \n\n(14) An increase of $11,782,000 for Training and Technical Assistance\
      \ ($34,214,000 estimated in FY 2022). Effective and continual training and technical\
      \ assistance are necessary to help States properly administer the Child Nutrition\
      \ Programs (CNPs) and to ensure States are equipped to identify and prevent\
      \ fraud and abuse. A change of $808,000 is due to pay cost and a change of $974,000\
      \ reflects increases to state and local index trends. \nAn additional $10 million\
      \ increase is for three current law proposals:\n• The first current law proposal\
      \ increases funding by $3 million for Child Nutrition Customer Service and Integration.\
      \ While FNS provides tools, training, and resources to help state and local\
      \ operators deliver specific programs, both within and beyond FNS. Because this\
      \ is a cross-program proposal, the costs of this initiative are being shared\
      \ with the SNAP, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,\
      \ and Children (WIC) and Nutrition Program Administration (NPA) accounts. The\
      \ full proposal can be referenced for more detail under the NPA section of this\
      \ document. \n• The second proposal is for $6 million for FNS to restore the\
      \ ability to provide timely program technical support. This proposal addresses\
      \ ability to better respond to state and local policy and operational issues\
      \ and questions. Please refer to the “Restore FNS’ Ability to Provide Timely\
      \ Program Technical Support” current law proposal for more details. \n• The\
      \ third proposal is for $1 million and is for more dedicated grants management\
      \ and contract resources. Currently FNS manages 700 active CNP grants and expects\
      \ to award another $100 million in new grants to States, tribes, schools and\
      \ districts, non-profit organizations, and agricultural producers in \nFY 2023.\
      \ The proposal, entitled, “Provide Dedicated Staff for Development, Management\
      \ and Oversight of Program Specific Grant Programs and Procurements” addresses\
      \ this need and can be referenced further within this document.    \n\n(15)\
      \ An increase of $5,706,000 for Child Nutrition (CN) Studies ($15,299,000 estimated\
      \ in FY 2022). FNS conducts a variety of studies, evaluations, and related activities\
      \ that respond to the needs of policy makers and managers and help ensure that\
      \ nutrition assistance programs achieve their goals effectively. This line supports\
      \ the critical evaluations needed for the CNP, including the federal staff needed\
      \ to oversee this vital work. The change consists of $87,000 for pay costs,\
      \ $619,000 to match state and local index trends, and $5 million for a current\
      \ law proposal titled, “Feasibility study for a national system for State reviews\
      \ of CNPs,” to complete a feasibility study for a national system for State\
      \ reviews of CNPs. \n\n(16) An increase of $888,000 for CN Payment Accuracy\
      \ ($11,427,000 estimated in FY 2022). This funding supports FNS’ robust Federal\
      \ oversight, monitoring and technical assistance, which are essential to the\
      \ identification, prevention and resolution of erroneous payments. The increase\
      \ consists of $462,000 to match state and local index trends and $426,000 due\
      \ to pay cost."

    Answer: Overpayments are outside of the agency's control because Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a state-managed federal
      program. As such, program payments provided by FNS go to various State agencies
      (SAs), which then pass through the funds to local agencies and sponsors. The
      activity that gives rise to overpayments occurs at the point where local agencies
      and sponsors (schools and school food authorities or school districts) determine
      children’s eligibility for program benefits and serve meals to children. All
      of this activity occurs prior to the point that states submit claims to FNS
      for federal payment. Although FNS cannot prevent these errors, the agency does
      engage in extensive training, issuance of technical assistance, and post-activity
      audits in an effort to help states, and the local organizations under their
      oversight, improve program performance and limit program error.

      implementing corrective actions are through WIC oversight. FNS uses management
      evaluations (MEs) as its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity
      by assessing WIC State agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating
      the accomplishment of WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance
      to State Agencies and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024,
      FNS' ME target area for WIC is Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition
      services is essential to carrying out the Program's mission. The Nutrition Services
      ME examines how State agencies plan for and deliver nutrition services, including
      nutrition and breastfeeding education. In addition to the ME target area, FNS
      also conducts a national risk-based ME assessment to identify State agencies
      with known program integrity issues. Program integrity issues include issues
      relating to improper payments, vendor management, certification/eligibility,
      fraud, or any other issue that poses a high monetary values risk to the Program.
      The FY 2020-2024 Target Area also include a focus on updating existing ME materials
      and technology. The target area supports the United States Department of Agriculture
      (USDA) and FNS priorities related to providing high quality customer service
      to WIC State agency partners, as well as ensuring integrity in the WIC Program
      through the timely resolution of issues identified through MEs. FNS continues
      to analyze ME data to identify opportunities to improve program administration
      and integrity. This includes addressing certification and vendor issues that
      could result in improper payments.

      Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Annual training is provided on FNS’ National
      Management Evaluation (ME) guidance to regional office staff who conduct MEs.
      The goal of this training to establish standards for FNS to effectively communicate
      findings and corrective action expectations to State agencies, to provide necessary
      technical assistance, and to support State agency program improvements. Additional
      WIC specific ME training is conducted throughout the year to support regional
      staff by holding bi-monthly meetings to discuss best practices and provide technical
      assistance, as well as specific technical assistance as needed to improve understanding
      and compliance of ME activities. Additional training is provided to state agencies
      through specific technical assistance during oversight activities. Training
      activities for State agency staff are further identified through the results
      of an annual target area report. This report looks at national trends of program
      integrity issues as well as programmatic deficiencies across all State agencies
      to issue technical assistance, policy memos, and training as needed. FNS has
      also recently released several resources for WIC State agencies that target
      improvement in the areas of vendor management and certification. These resources
      include the WIC Vendor Management and Food Delivery Handbook, a new toolkit
      on assessing and developing WIC Vendor Peer Group Systems, and an updated tool

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
      for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has what is needed with respect to internal
      controls, human capital and information system and other infrastructure to reduce
      Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable rate.  WIC program integrity
      is a priority for FNS. FNS WIC has the administrative infrastructure for meeting
      reduction targets, establishing and maintaining sufficient internal controls,
      and producing yearly estimates of WIC improper payment rates and dollar values.
      Management evaluations (MEs) are FNS's primary oversight mechanisms. MEs include
      onsite reviews of State and local agency operations, and reviews of program-specific
      documentation. FNS focuses WIC MEs on key areas related to program integrity
      and analyzes the resulting ME data to identify opportunities to improve program
      administration and integrity.
    Needs2: The expectation is to continue the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
      for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) funding at a level that will allow monitoring
      via Management Evaluations (MEs), provide technical assistance, and Electronic
      Benefits Transfer (EBT) support.
    Sufficiency: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
      for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) uses Management Evaluations (MEs) as
      its primary oversight tool. MEs assure program integrity by assessing WIC State
      agency compliance with Program requirements, evaluating the accomplishment of
      WIC Program objectives, and providing technical assistance to State agencies
      and supporting efforts to improve and innovate. In FY 2020-2024, FNS' ME target
      area for WIC is Nutrition Services. Delivering high quality nutrition services
      is essential to carrying out the Program's mission. The Nutrition Services ME
      examines how State agencies plan for and deliver nutrition services, including
      nutrition and breastfeeding education. The FY 2020-2024 Target Area also include
      a focus on updating existing ME materials and technology. The target area supports
      the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FNS priorities related
      to providing high quality customer service to WIC State agency partners, as
      well as ensuring integrity in the WIC Program through the timely resolution
      of issues identified through MEs. FNS continues to analyze ME data to identify
      opportunities to improve program administration and integrity. The FY 2020-2024
      target area and ongoing ME data analysis support integrity in the WIC Program
      through the timely resolution of issues identified through reviews. This includes
      addressing certification and vendor issues that could result in improper payments.

    Answer: Overpayments outside the Agency’s control occur when the program’s failure
      to access data/information due to human errors effect the determination of whether
      or not a beneficiary or recipient should be receiving a payment. Food and Nutrition
      Service (FNS) provides State agencies with grants to administer the Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC,
      as established by statute, is a state-managed federal program. The nature of
      FNS programs, as established by statute, inherently makes all overpayments outside
      of Agency control.

      State agencies with the knowledge and tools needed to individually develop meaningful
      root cause analysis and corrective action plans, including through the issuance
      of policy guidance. In FY 2023, FNS conducted a root cause analysis training
      series that provided training to State agencies on how to conduct a root cause
      analysis using FNS-provided and widely available tools (such as Excel). The
      series featured policy staff at FNS that explored different policy responses
      and resources available to address root causes of payment error. Several State
      agencies presented throughout the series on approaches they took and the results
      they saw. All sessions offered a question and answer component as well, allowing
      State agencies to ask questions tailored to their situation. FNS also developed
      tools to assist with conducting root cause analysis by State agencies, created
      dashboards for FNS to better identify State agencies struggling with payment
      errors, and issued guidance to State agencies on improving verification procedures
      and developing corrective action plans. FNS verification guidance documents
      related to income verification sources and using information received from other
      public assistance programs. FNS also provided significant guidance and technical
      assistance to assist States in managing the transition from COVID-19 related
      administrative flexibilities back to normal processes while keeping a focus
      on payment accuracy.

    Needs1: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are processed
      and administered by State agencies, with FNS oversight. State policy options,
      organizational structures, and use of technology vary from State to State. FNS
      provides oversight and technical assistance to States in measuring and reporting
      improper payments. Because FNS does not provide benefits directly to recipients,
      the Program must work through its State administering agencies to measure, monitor,
      and address improper payments and is not positioned to determine or control
      each State agency's internal controls, human capital, or information systems.
    Needs2: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

    Answer: Overpayments related to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
      are outside of FNS' control because SNAP benefits are processed and administered
      by State agencies. FNS provides State agencies with guidance related to eligibility
      determinations, provides oversight and technical assistance to States, and measures
      and reports improper payments. State agencies make decisions about how to administer
      the program amongst various policy options, waivers, and demonstration projects;
      directly determines eligibility for SNAP; and provides benefits to recipients.
      Therefore, FNS must work with its State agency partners to measure, monitor,

    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q3
    Description_Action_Taken: A large amount of RMA's improper payments resulting
      from the inability to access data/information are situations where policyholders
      could not support certifications with acceptable production evidence/records.  As
      a result, RMA Compliance worked with the Product Management Branch to update
      the Apple Crop Policy record requirements in for vertically integrated or direct-marketing
      perennial producers.

  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Audit
    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: One type of error leading to improper payments for failure
      to access data/information resulted from policies established under a unit structure
      that did not meet the qualifications.  RMA policy and procedure outlines criteria
      that must be met in order to qualify for the unit structure being requested.  When
      these qualifications are not met the result is an improper payment. To further
      assess improper payments associated with unit structure, RMA will conduct a
      program review in order to determine if Approved Insurance Providers are appropriately
      applying unit structure requirements.

  - Action_Taken: Completed
    Action_Type: Audit
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: Improper payments resulting from a failure to access
      data/information are often the result of process and/or administrative type
      errors (i.e., keying errors, calculation errors, process errors, etc.,) To address
      these types of errors, RMA Compliance reviewed Approved Insurance Provider's
      (AIP's) quality control processes as part of the AIP Performance Review (APR)
      allowing RMA to identify potential vulnerabilities that may lead to improper
      payments.  If vulnerabilities are identified, RMA issues APR outcomes and/or
      observations in which the AIP must respond with a corrective action and a timeframe
      for completion.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp6_1
  - Action_Taken: Planned
    Action_Type: Behavioral/Psych Influence
    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: A majority of the improper payments related to the inability
      to access data/information were the result of policyholders over-reporting insurable
      acres on rainfall index plans of insurance.  RMA will issue an Informational
      Memorandum reminding external stakeholders of procedural requirements related
      to acreage reporting and reiterate the importance of applying these procedures
      accurately to prevent improper payments.

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: At this time, the agency has the necessary resources to reduce improper
      payments.  This assumes that the program remains at the current size.  If the
      program expands, additional resources may be necessary.
    Needs2: The agency’s most recent budget request includes funding to comply with
      A-123 and financial statement audit requirements, higher staffing and hiring
      needs, and migrate and modernize information technology systems. The agency
      currently has enough resources to reduce improper payments; however, additional
      resources are necessary to sustain program growth and increasing costs.
    Sufficiency: RMA's comprehensive analysis of improper payment criteria relates
      the root cause (i.e., the type of error that led to the improper payment, who
      was responsible for the improper payment, and at what stage of the crop insurance
      life cycle the improper payment occurred) of the improper payment directly to
      the amount of the improper payment.  This strategic assessment allows RMA to
      develop corrective action plans that address the root causes that result in
      larger amounts of improper payments. A continuous analysis of root causes and
      implementation of corrective actions that help remediate improper payments has
      allowed RMA to maintain a tolerable error for multiple years.  Federal Crop
      Insurance is a multi-billion-dollar program. RMA’s ability to maintain a improper
      payment error rate below three percent for the past nine years indicates the
      effectiveness of the measures we’ve taken to reduce improper payments.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: USDA
    Answer: Overpayments within the agency's control are the result of errors that
      occurred when the data/information needed exited and could be accessed, however,
      a breakdown in an administrative or procedural process caused the payment to
      become improper.  Due to the nature of these types of errors (i.e., inadvertent
      keying errors, calculation errors, process errors, etc.) Risk Management Agency
      has the ability to identify root causes and address deficiencies in the quality
      control processes at the Approved Insurance Provider (AIP) level resulting in
      fewer improper payments within our control.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: USDA
    Answer: The Risk Management Agency (RMA) partners with private insurance companies,
      Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs), to deliver the federal crop insurance program
      through agents who sell policies directly to producers.  The Standard Reinsurance
      Agreement which is an agreement between RMA and the AIPs restricts agents and
      AIPs from influencing the premium for a given policy, such as a producer's certification.  Overpayments
      outside the agency's control typically consist of certification errors by the
      policyholder.  These errors include, but are not limited to; inadvertent errors,
      misinterpretation of policy, calculation errors, or the inability to support
      certifications when documentation is requested.  These types of errors are determined
      to be outside the agency's control or unavoidable because they take place during
      certification stages of the crop insurance program.
