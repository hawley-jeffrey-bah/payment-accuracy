    Description_Action_Taken: "ETA continued to support expansion and updates to the\
      \ State Information Data Exchange System (SIDES). SIDES improves the timeliness\
      \ and quality of job separation information from employers, thus reducing the\
      \ number of improper payments to claimants who are determined to be ineligible\
      \ for UI due to disqualifying job separations, such as quitting without good\
      \ cause or being discharged for misconduct. \n\nAnother key antifraud and improper\
      \ payment reduction strategy includes exploring and pursuing additional data\
      \ sources and services that could be made available to state UI agencies to\
      \ support states with identifying and preventing fraud, reducing improper payments,\
      \ and ensuring timely and accurate eligibility determinations. \n\nThe Department\
      \ is also using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to make available to states\
      \ (for up to two years subject to available funding) both in-person and digital,\
      \ government-operated,\nID verification services, known as the National ID Verification\
      \ Offering (NIDVO). NIDVO provides a remote, mobile ready digital ID verification\
      \ solution through Login.gov, in partnership with GSA’s Login.gov. In-person\
      \ ID verification is available to participating states at over 19,000 retail\
      \ post office locations across the country in partnership with USPS. \nThe Department\
      \ also used ARPA funds to provide states with implementation grants to automate\
      \ and improve business processes identified through recent Tiger Team engagements\
      \ with 36 state UI agencies. \n\nETA develops, updates, oversees, and communicates\
      \ UI antifraud strategies and program integrity controls through its robust\
      \ and dynamic UI Integrity Strategic Plan.  While this plan provides a detailed\
      \ accounting of ETA’s FY 2024 actions, the plan is not made publicly available,\
      \ as it contains confidential or sensitive information regarding the Department’s\
      \ UI fraud risk mitigation and improper payment reduction activities to strengthen\

      \ fraudulent activity and prevent improper payments. Leveraging a multi-layered\
      \ approach means states are using multiple defense strategies to address fraud.\
      \  \n\nThe Department considers NIDVO one of many the tools available to support\
      \ states with the multi-layered approach, by offering government-operated ID\
      \ verification options.  ETA also continued to support and provide funding for\
      \ enhancements to the UI Integrity Center’s IDH, which is a secure, robust,\
      \ centralized, multi-state data system that allows participating states to cross-match,\
      \ compare, and analyze UC claims data against a variety of datasets for enhanced\
      \ prevention and detection of improper payments and fraud in UC programs.  In\
      \ FY 2024, the Department and Treasury jointly announced an exciting new data\
      \ sharing partnership between Treasury’s Fiscal Service and the UI Integrity\
      \ Center to make DNP data sources and services available to the IDH to further\
      \ support states in identifying fraud, preventing and detecting improper payments,\

    Description_Action_Taken: "In its FY 2025 budget submission, the Department proposed\
      \ a comprehensive package of provisions designed to provide new and expanded\
      \ tools and controls for states to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers\
      \ are properly paid and to prevent fraud and improper payments in the UI system.\
      \ The package includes the following components:\n\n•\tRequire states to use\
      \ system(s) designated by the Secretary for cross-matching claimants to prevent\
      \ and detect improper payments, including fraud, which would currently include\
      \ the IDH.\n\n•\tRequire states to use system(s) designated by the Secretary\
      \ for electronic transmission of requests for information relating to UC and\
      \ the provision of such information between the state UI agency and employers\
      \ or their agents, which would currently include SIDES.\n\n•\tRequire states\
      \ to cross-match against the NDNH to better identify individuals continuing\
      \ to claim UC after returning to work, which is one of the leading root causes\
      \ of UI improper payments.\n\n•\tRequire states to cross-match with a system(s)\
      \ designated by the Secretary that contains information on individuals who are\
      \ incarcerated, such as the Social Security Administration’s PUPS or other systems\
      \ for crossmatching incarceration data. This should result in increased prevention\
      \ and detection of improper and fraudulent payments. \n\n•\tRequire states to\
      \ disclose information to the DOL-OIG to conduct audits and investigations to\
      \ discover fraud, waste, and abuse or inefficiencies in the UC programs.\n\n\
      •\tProvide the Secretary with meaningful enforcement authority and the ability\
      \ to reward good performance. This proposal would create a new remedy so that\
      \ instead of withholding a state’s entire administrative grant for failing to\
      \ meet the performance measures or achieve minimum technology standards, the\
      \ Secretary can require a portion of the state’s administrative grant be used\
      \ to correct failing performance and/or have the state participate in required\
      \ technical assistance activities offered by the Department.\n\n•\tAllow states\
      \ to retain up to five percent of recovered fraudulent UI overpayments for program\
      \ integrity use.\n•\tRequire states to use penalty and interest collections\
      \ solely for UI administration.\n\n•\tAllow states the authority to issue a\
      \ formal warning when claimants are unclear on the work search requirements.\n\
      \n•\tAllow states to use contract support in recovery efforts under the Treasury\
      \ Offset Program (TOP).\n\nThe Department issued a UI Transformation Plan (Building\
      \ Resilience: A plan to transform unemployment insurance) on April 5, 2024.\
      \  The plan included a compilation of legislative reforms needed to support\
      \ transformation of the UI system. See Appendix III of the plan  https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/transformation_plan.asp.\

    Needs1: While the Department has determined a fraud risk tolerance level for the
      UI program, OUI has not yet determined an IP tolerable rate for this program.
      Setting a tolerable rate will need to take the states' operations into account.
      The National overpayment, unknown, and underpayment rates (improper payments)
      are driven on the processes and performance of the states. During the pandemic,
      states transitioned experienced staff from their normal duties to assist with
      the unprecedented claims volume to operate the regular UI programs as well as
      implementing and administering the temporary pandemic UI programs. Other factors
      that prevented states from reducing improper payments include such factors such
      as outdated IT systems, loss of experienced staff, new inexperience staff, and
      the reduction of administrative funding, which significantly impacted resources
      and staffing level. A "tolerable rate baseline" couldn't be derived during the
      historic spike in claims during the Pandemic. As the program enters a post-pandemic
      environment, OUI can begin to examine a baseline to determine a tolerable rate
    Needs2: The FY 2025 President’s Budget request proposes a comprehensive package
      of provisions designed to provide new and expanded tools and controls for states
      to help improve efforts to ensure entitled workers are properly paid and to
      prevent fraud and improper payments in the UI system. This includes a number
      of provisions to improve the administration and integrity of the UI program.
      The budget submission includes requested increases in UI administrative funding,
      UI National Activities funding for program integrity and anti-fraud activities
      to support ID verification services in the states, and funding to support technology
      modernization that will improve states’ abilities to detect and prevent fraud
      and other improper payments in the program.
    Sufficiency: The Department will continue to provide legislative technical assistance
      on proposed UI Integrity legislation as needed and promote the Department’s
      UI integrity legislative package as set out in the FY 2025 budget proposal.
      In addition, ETA will continue its progress to make changes to the UI confidentiality
      regulations at 20 CFR Part 603, that would, in part, address the issue of providing
      the DOL-OIG with access to state UI data, including for investigations and audit.

    Answer: 'The state agency identified an issue but did not properly follow procedures
      or complete required forms and/or provided incorrect information or did not
      resolve the issue(s). Alternatively, the issue could have been the result of
      a third-party error/incorrect information.


      In addition, these issues may involve instances where the state agency was resolving
      the error or had detected the error as a result of a crossmatch with National
      Directory of New Hire (NDNH) or wage records and an issue was detected after
      the payment was issued.


      State agencies operate the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. Thus, overpayments
      originate from state agency administration issues and are not within the Federal
      agency’s control. Report headings referring to activities “within the agency’s
      control” reflect matters within state agencies’ control.

    Answer: "The UI program is a unique federal-state partnership based on Federal\
      \ law but administered through individual state laws by 53 state UI agencies.\
      \ States vary in their information technology (IT) systems, level of automation,\
      \ staffing capacity, and methods and strategies for prevention, detection, and\
      \ recovery of improper payments and fraud. Additionally, no two states' written\
      \ laws, regulations, and policies specifying eligibility conditions are identical,\
      \ and differences in these conditions influence the potential for error and\
      \ improper payments. Two states could have identical laws but may interpret\
      \ them quite differently. States with stringent or complex provisions tend to\
      \ have higher improper payment rates than those with simpler, more straightforward\
      \ provisions.\n\nFurthermore, Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (SSA)\
      \ requires UI payments to be made “when due” and, once a person is determined\
      \ eligible, this law prohibits states from suspending payments until an official\
      \ determination has been made that payments are no longer due. This statutory\
      \ factor requires states to make payments that may later be determined as improper\
      \ as a result of obtaining new information. For good policy reasons, states\
      \ must continue paying benefits until due process occurs (notice and an opportunity\
      \ for a hearing is provided before benefit payments are stopped). This UI program\
      \ structural feature is a primary driver for top root causes of UI improper\
      \ payments.  Moreover, unlike many other benefit programs, eligibility for UI\
      \ benefits is determined on a weekly basis.  There are more opportunities to\
      \ make errors and for improper payments to be created.  \n"

    Answer: Unknown payments were caused due to insufficient staff due to retirement,
      staff turnover, and lack of experienced staff to complete investigations. In
      addition, staff continued to work on backlog reduction resulting from the temporary,
      pandemic-related unemployment compensation (UC) programs and to assist in fraud
      detection and identity (ID) verification in the UC programs.

    Answer: In order to determine if a payment is proper or improper, state staff
      must obtain the required information (including ID verification, employment
      and wage history, separation information, etc.) to make a decision of eligibility.
      The state must verify the accuracy of the information received by the claimant,
      employers, and/or third parties. The failure to document the results of any
      step in the process or the failure to obtain the information results in a question
      of whether the correct person and correct amount were paid.

    Accountability: The program has staff responsible for establishing and maintaining
      sufficient internal controls toward the reduction of IPs.  The program incorporates
      internal controls into the annual performance standards of agency managers and
      subordinate staff to ensure focus on understating and preventing IPs.  Agency
      managers are held responsible and accountable for meeting proper payment rates.  On
      a monthly basis, managers are required to submit results of IPs identified through
      audit results and supervisor reviews.  The program also conducts quarterly meetings
      with the OIG and the medical bill contractor's staff to discuss the identification
      of potentially fraudulent activity.
    Needs1: The agency has sufficient resources to reduce improper and unknown payments.  There
      is sufficient staff to conduct the necessary audits and reviews as well as the
      necessary infrastructure to update information systems.  Additionally, the agency
      has working arrangements with other federal agencies to provide the information
      needed to issue payments.
    Needs2: The budget submission includes a request for funds for human capital.
    Sufficiency: The program plans to continue to utilize resources provided by Treasury's
      program integrity center.  It will continue to utilize its current audit corrective
      actions with its staff and current medical bill pay contractors.  As needed,
      the program may add additional auditing actions to identify areas that may be
      of concern to stakeholders.  Additionally, the agency will fully cooperate with
      the OIG's auditing program as part of the department's annual financial reporting
      requirements.  Unit/Office level actions will focus on issues that cause IP's/UP's
      such as compensation rate reviews and official pay rate determinations.  Use
      of Treasury's program will help the program's effort to focus on the cause of
      eligibility issues such as offsetting and deceased persons.  Monthly medical
      bill pay audits ensure the program's medical bill contractors are processing
      payments consisted with program requirements.  The course of action planned
      allows the agency to monitor payments and identify potential IP/UP's and their
      root causes at multiple levels.  Additionally, the use of data allows the program
      to combine individual audit findings into trends to perform a root cause analysis.  This
      multilayered approach can lead to identifying trends, which will lead to better
      training and potentially automated controls to reduce future improper payments.  The
      agency will continue to prioritize payment processing and the identification
      of improper payments.  Each week, the program makes millions of dollars of payments,
      and regular monitoring is key to future root cause analysis.  The agency will
      also look for opportunities that may lead to implementation of systematic controls
      as well as its efforts to address over and under payments after they have been
      identified.

    Answer: Payments are within agency control because they are either issued directly
      by program staff or through the agency’s contractor, which utilizes a system
      programmed to the specifications of the agency.  Throughout the year, the agency

    Answer: Beneficiaries who are totally disabled and receive periodic roll payments,
      are required to submit medical documentation to support ongoing disability from
      work.  If a beneficiary fails to submit requested medical reports, or the medical
      evidence shows the beneficiary can return to work or full recovered, the program
      may suspend or terminate benefits.  However, statutory and regulatory barriers
      limit the program’s ability to stop or adjust payments based on medical review
      without due process.  The compensation payments would continue until a final
      decision is issued.
