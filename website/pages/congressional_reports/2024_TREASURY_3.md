    Answer: 'In May 2024, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program was determined
      to be susceptible to significant improper payments for the fiscal year 2023
      OMB A-123 assessment period. In response to the May 2024 determination, the
      Office of Capital Access (OCA) is evaluating options to address the potential
      and actual improper payments and any unknown payments in ERA. OCA is coordinating
      with Treasury''s Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer in establishing
      next steps for these programs, including timelines.


      In August 2022, Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these
      programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the
      root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors
      in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources.
      Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs Treasury decided it would
      not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report
      or on paymentaccuracy.gov. In addition, because the ERA program has concluded
      almost all of its disbursements, there is no basis for improper payment estimates
      going forward.'

  Program: Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit

  - Agency: TREASURY
    Answer: The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) became refundable only
      for Tax Year (TY) 2021, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), as
      part of the COVID-19 pandemic assistance programs. The changes to the CDCTC
      were temporary, applying only to TY 2021. The short-term nature of this program
      limits the IRS’s ability to calculate improper payment estimates. To generate
      an improper payment estimate, the IRS needs to conduct comprehensive audits
      over a large sample of tax returns, requiring at least three years’ worth of
      data to ensure accuracy. However, because ARPA’s changes to the CDCTC were limited
      to TY 2021, there isn’t enough time or data to create an estimate before the
      refundable nature of this program ends. Accordingly, the credit has no basis
      for improper payment estimates. In August 2022 Treasury determined that due
      to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate
      of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action
      plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and
      be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief
      programs Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either
      in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. However, these programs
      will remain on the three-year risk assessment rotation.
