    Description_Action_Taken: "The identified Training corrective actions aim to reduce\
      \ the unknown payments. Eligibility Tier testing revealed significant difficulties\
      \ in retrieving evidence from the contract administrators to timely support\
      \ tenant eligibility and any error rate estimation would be misleading based\
      \ on a lack of precision in an extrapolating error rate. As corrective actions,\
      \ HUD continued its training efforts to improve contract administrators’ timely\
      \ evidence organization, retention, collection, and submission through training\
      \ and outreach. The identified corrective actions will provide knowledge to\
      \ the Owners/Agents on their role in the testing process. Due to the absence\
      \ of adequate documentation from the Owners/Agents to substantiate the payments,\
      \ $45.24 million of unknown payments are being reported in FY24. With improved\
      \ understanding and support regarding the documentation requirements, Owners/Agents\
      \ will have additional knowledge to furnish the correct documents timely and\
      \ reduce the extrapolated error.  \n\nEligibility Tier payments are not being\
      \ reported in the FY 2024 Payment Integrity. Therefore, root cause and corrective\
      \ action determinations would be premature in this reporting cycle. That said,\
      \ HUD will utilize the lessons learned during the Payee Tier testing during\
      \ the Eligibility testing."

    Accountability: "In HUD's Audit Management Systems (AMS), for Single Audit Act\
      \ (SAA) audits Headquarters' Primary Organization Heads (HPOH) are responsible\
      \ for assigning Program Office Management Points of Contact and Audit Liaison\
      \ Officers.  Assigned Program staff are responsible for developing and submitting\
      \ management letters to auditees regarding resolution findings in their single\
      \ audit report associated with an Assistance Listing Number (ALN) and working\
      \ with auditees to ensure reports are submitted timely and findings are resolved.\
      \  Audit Liaison Officers are responsible for approving the closure of findings\
      \ where applicable.   \nAudits performed in accordance with the SAA. Of 1984\
      \ (31 USC 7501-7505) and OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments,\
      \ and Non-Profit Organizations” are usually prepared by Independent Auditors\
      \ (IAs). The submission, monitoring, and tracking of findings resulting from\
      \ these audit reports are under the direct authority and responsibility of each\
      \ applicable HPOH and are tracked in HUD’s audit tracking system’s SAA module.\
      \ HUD adopted a Departmental Single Audit Policy that requires the use of the\
      \ SAA module for all HUD program documentation of Single Audit reviews as of\
      \ March 2024.   SAA audits can involve more than one program, agency, or State\
      \ and local governments, etc. Entities receiving federal financial assistance\
      \ may be required to have an audit performed in accordance with the SAA of 1984\
      \ as amended and the OMB Circular A-133. The HUD program also conducts oversight\
      \ through REAC Inspection Reports, Management Occupancy Reviews (MORs), Qualitative\
      \ Assessment Scoreboard (QAS) and monitoring of EIV Reports. Single audits include\
      \  Audited Financial Statements and for entities that do not meet the requirements\
      \ for a single audit most are still required to submit unaudited financial statements\
      \ to REAC. \n"
    Needs1: 'As a result of extraordinary level of effort by HUD and contract administrators,

    Needs2: 'As a result of extraordinary level of effort by HUD and contract administrators,
      HUD was able to  measure that the IP and UP rates are under the tolerable rate
      for the Payee Tier of this program (7%). HUD requested resources to support
      technology modernization efforts. These modernization efforts will help HUD
      measure improper payments in the Eligibility Tier. Housing will benefit from
      modernization of EIV and eLOCCS and would benefit from modernization of TRACS

    Sufficiency: 'Training will provide knowledge to the Owners/Agents on their role
      in the testing process. If Owners/Agents understand and are able to timely provide
      the correct documents this could potentially reduce the extrapolated error.
      D With improved understanding and support regarding the documentation requirements,
      Owners/Agents will have additional knowledge to furnish the correct documents,
      thereby significantly reducing the number of unknown payments.


      After receiving training, the Owners/Agents will better understand the documents
      and timeline required from them for testing. Additionally, when the request
      was made to the Owners/Agents in FY24 they were often able to timely provide
      correct documentation after failing to do so initially.'

    Answer: 'During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned
      improvements to establish effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental
      Assistance (TBRA) program. The goal is to prevent and detect improper payments,
      as outlined in the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan. Currently,
      HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO)
      uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification
      (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards,
      income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public
      housing agenciey’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed
      both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD evaluated existing reports
      for estimating improper payment rates but found they did not meet the stringent
      requirements set by the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA). Additionally,
      these reports could not generate reliable error estimates with sufficient precision
      to cover the entire payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to
      PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.


      Looking ahead to FY 2025 and beyond, and as funding is available, HUD will continue
      implementing the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and will explore
      testing methods for sub-populations within the TBRA portfolio. By exploring
      other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations,
      HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts
      and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit from
      efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers
      through the following initiatives:


      •The Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) is set to significantly improve
      the administration of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. It will modernize
      how HUD records monthly HCV performance and automate cash management transactions
      as well as financial reporting. eVMS will enhance the accuracy and timeliness
      of housing assistance payments (HAPs), thereby reducing prepaid expenses and
      accounts payables. This will be achieved by using real-time family-level data
      that PHAs submit to HUD via the HUD-50058 through IMS PIC. The system will also
      perform month-to-month reconciliations for retroactive adjustments due to annual
      income certifications or changes in family composition. Moreover, eVMS will
      calculate and track administrative fees across all voucher programs, simplifying
      decision-making for PHAs regarding voucher issuance and other program needs
      by providing daily online views of PHA funding balances. Overall, eVMS will
      automate cash management payments and reconciliations, streamline reporting
      for HUD’s financials, and generate data to test elements within payee and eligibility
      tiers.


      •HUD is also advancing one key project, a beta version of the Enhanced EIV tool,
      which uses business intelligence and predictive analytics to identify income
      trends and changes. The system improvements will strengthen preventative controls
      at the time of initial applications and renewals, with a focus on eligibility.
      The Enhanced EIV tool will help identify income discrepancies during tenant
      applications and renewals, providing PHAs with immediate access to income data
      reported by other partners. This proactive approach aims to reduce the risk
      of improper payments resulting from income discrepancies. By leveraging both
      current and historical data alongside predictive analytics, HUD will be able
      to pinpoint trends and forecasts concerning family income. The enhancements
      will eventually expand to involve multiple stakeholders, including all housing
      authorities. The Enhanced EIV tool will offer a comprehensive view across the
      department for all PHAs, ensuring that accurate tenant-level information is
      used for determining Voucher Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) eligibility.
      This holistic perspective will aid in identifying discrepancies between tenant-reported
      income and data from other partners and federal agencies, such as the National
      Database of New Hires from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).


      These initiatives reflect HUD''s commitment to enhancing the integrity and efficiency
      of the TBRA program, ultimately benefiting the communities we serve and demonstrating
      a strong commitment to payment integrity.
