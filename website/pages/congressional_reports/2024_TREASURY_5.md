SurveyData:
- Answer: 'Many of Treasury''s overpayments are payroll related. These overpayments
    include issues such as corrected timecards, FEGLI corrections, duplicate cash
    awards, etc. Treasury also had contract

    overpayments which include duplicate amounts or incorrect amounts. Many of these
    overpayments were identified and recovered through post payment audits.'

- Answer: "Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are subject\
    \ to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for that\
    \ month.  Invoices not processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP)\
    \ in excess of $2,500.00 are subject to secondary review before being paid.  Invoices\
    \ under $2,500.00 are subject to review through statistical sampling procedures.\
    \  Travel vouchers processed through the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel\
    \ system are subject to a post payment audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements\
    \ under $2,500.   All payments of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population.\
    \ These payments require a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers\
    \ processed through the MoveLINQ system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit\
    \ and review. For payment customers, once the vouchers have been pre-audited and\
    \ approved for payment they are interfaced to Oracle the financial system where\
    \ they are paid. \n  \nThe DNP portal implementation has provided a way bureau's/office's\
    \ procurement and payable offices to review vendor files prior to disbursement.\
    \  It has also given them an opportunity to review the monthly payment file results\
    \ to identify any improper payments made to a vendor in the DNP portal."

- Answer: 'Majority of these cases were erroneous personnel actions that when corrected
    resulted in overpayment to the employee.


    5 U.S.C. Section 5584 authorizes waivers of debt claims due to the United States
    if it can be shown there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault,
    or lack of good faith on the part of the employee. Since the debt was established
    due to a corrected personnel action, the decision to grant or deny the waiver
    turns on fault. Fault exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is found
    that the individual knew or should have known that they received an erroneous
    payment.'

- Answer: 'Fiscal Service management has determined that conducting recovery audits
    for its programs would not be cost effective. Fiscal Service makes payments based
    on the public law, adjudications, or payment certification from Federal Agencies.
    Although, a formal recovery audit is not performed, internal reviews are conducted
    before all payments are made. A justification was submitted to OMB in 2018 to
    request exemption for reporting recovery audits for this fund group.* Per OMB''s
    letter to Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, dated March 20, 2014, the
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) custodial/bond programs are exempt from Payment
    Recapture Auditing. Treasury considers these payments negative revenue receipts,
    not outlays, and thereby exempt them from improper payment requirements. OMB agreed
    that this is a reasonable approach, however these custodial/bond programs are
    still required to conduct risk assessments. IRS submitted a justification to OMB
    in 2016 to exempt its non-custodial/bond programs from recovery auditing. The
    five-year average cost of recovery auditing far exceeded the average improper
    payments identified. No improper payments were recaptured through recovery auditing;
    all funds recaptured were identified through normal operating processes and collected
    through established procedures. Pre-payment reviews are conducted for the purposes
    of preventing, identifying, and recovering improper payments for contracts, modifications,
    and task orders. For its fund groups relating to the COVID-19 pandemic relief
    programs, including the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, IRS provided a justification
    for determination that recovery auditing is not cost effective in FY 2023. Current
    business practices (e.g., audit reports, self-reported overpayments, statistical
    samples conducted under PIIA) provide an efficient and effective means for identification
    of overpayments. The IRS''s robust information technology platform includes several
    filters to monitor the accuracy of eligibility rules and payment certification
    for the various tax credits.* The Office of International Assistance provided
    a cost-effective justification to OMB for recovery auditing in 2018. Payments
    for this fund group can be in two forms: payment vouchers on letter of credit
    which are administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and direct cash
    payments via the Secure Payment System. Internal reviews are performed before
    all payments are made. Management has determined that it would not be cost-effective
    to perform formal recovery auditing on this fund group. * The Office of the Comptroller
    of the Currency (OCC) submitted a cost-effective justification for recovery auditing
    to OMB in 2018. The justification was based on the following: The OCCs improper
    payment risk assessment for the five categories of payments (contract payments,
    invoices, travel card, purchase card, payroll and benefits) has resulted in a
    low-risk rating since at least FY 2012. The OCC has strong internal controls over
    payments as validated by A-123 testing. The OCC conducts ongoing internal reviews
    of travel vouchers, purchase cards, and other transactions. The OCC performs an
    annual review of contract payments using analytic techniques to identify potentially
    fraudulent activity or other payment anomalies. The OCC has very low delinquency
    and unauthorized use rates for government travel and purchase cards and for expenditures
    of OCC funds outside of prescribed policies and procedures. The most recent payment
    recapture audit activities required a higher cost in employee resources than the
    amount recovered. * The Treasury Franchise Fund submitted a cost-effective justification
    to OMB in 2018. The qualitative risk assessments for this fund group have been
    low risk since 2013. Prior fiscal year recovery audits before the justification
    was established yielded .01% of disbursements for this fund group. This fund group
    conducts pre-payment and post-payment reviews. Because of these reasons, management
    determined it would not be cost-effective to conduct recovery audits on this fund
    group. * The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) submitted a cost-effective
    justification for recovery auditing to OMB in 2019. The basis of the justification
    was that BEP''s risk assessments are consistently low risk for improper payments.
    Prior fiscal years found that the improper payment dollar amount for BEP equates
    to .004% of the total disbursements for the program. BEP continues to do pre-payment
    and post-payment reviews. * Treasury’s Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation
    Services (CERTS) program identified one instance of overpayment, and one instance
    of ineligibility, both of which were 100% recaptured, and represented less than
    0.1% of the total program awards. As of August 2022, the CERTS program had completed
    all its awards to recipients and shifted to the recipient monitoring phase of
    the program. Since there was a low prevalence of overpayments and payments to
    ineligible recipients, and a 100% recapture rate, the cost of performing a recapture
    audit would outweigh any potential benefit. * Treasury’s Coronavirus State and
    Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) identified three overpayments, which were 100%
    recaptured, and represented less than 1.0% of the total program awards. In each
    of these three cases, recipients notified Treasury of the overpayments and were
    provided instructions on how to return funds to Treasury. Since the program has
    implemented multiple levels of control activities to enhance the frequency and
    quality of payment integrity reviews, the risk of improper payments is low. Therefore,
    the cost of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential
    benefit. * Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) consulted, during
    the application phase, with the primary federal regulators for each applicant
    (being a regulated financial institution) to confirm that it was eligible to receive
    funding. The underwriting process was conducted in coordination with teams of
    community development finance and financial institutions and external financial
    advisers. ECIP program management was required to approve each investment decision,
    based on established procedures which incorporated risk management controls and
    included multiple layers of review. Since the program has implemented multiple
    levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risk
    of improper payments is low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate
    payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative. * Treasury’s Local
    Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF) has maintained its own listing
    and database of eligible primary recipients, and therefore, the eligibility risk
    of primary recipients is essentially zero. Since LATCF has multiple levels of
    internal/quality controls to enhance the frequency and quality of the payment
    integrity review, the risk of improper payments is low. * Treasury’s State Small
    Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) program team relies on a vigorous SSBCI application
    review process and conducts post-approval procedures through SSBCI''s  Compliance
    Program. The application process includes checks to validate identity, confirm
    eligibility, and ensure accurate inputs for the payment (grant sizing) formula,
    as well as verify that the applicant is not on exclusion lists (including the
    Do Not Pay Portal) dedicated to preventing improper payments.  * For the Capital
    Projects Fund (CPF), Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA), and Homeowners Assistance
    Fund (HAF), Treasury has implemented multiple levels of control activities including:
    (1) reviews of single audit reports which facilitates the identification and prevention
    of costs that may ultimately result in improper payments if not remedied;  and
    (2) a standardized, cross-program compliance program that includes established
    compliance testing procedures as well as recipient self-identified reporting,
    through which improper payments are identified and documented in accordance with
    non-compliance remediation procedures and remediation action taken. * The Special
    Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) has an established inter-agency
    agreement and service level agreement in place with the Treasury''s Administrative
    Resource Center (ARC) Financial Services program for providing financial support
    services. As it relates specifically to recovery processes this includes but is
    not limited to activities such as performing funds control reviews and maintenance
    on a weekly basis and review recovery analysis. ARC has processes in place for
    financial reporting and reconciliations on a routine basis to identify, prevent
    and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. SIGPR has also
    developed and implemented policies and procedures to ensure controls over payments
    are implemented, including daily financial reporting and reconciliations to identify,
    to prevent and/or recover improper payments based on established thresholds. Since
    there are payment recovery processes included within the policies and multiple
    levels of review involving multiple outside and independent assessments, the risks
    of improper payments are low and the potential benefit of conducting a separate
    payment recapture audit is minimal and would be duplicative.  Therefore, the cost
    of performing a payment recapture audit would outweigh any potential benefit.
    * The Treasury Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) has analyzed several
    factors and reviewed several current procedures for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund
    to determine if implementation of payment recapture auditing is cost effective
    These include: a low risk assessment determination, EOAF staff reviews monthly
    payments for accuracy, obligations are established at a very low detail levels
    to provide easier control and review of payment activity, the nature of the program
    payments being made to state and local law enforcement agencies minimizes improper
    payments, and improper payment review yielded no improper payment issues. Therefore,
    EOAF has determined the additional cost for staff and resources to conduct payment
    recapture audits would not be cost effective. * The Office of DC Pensions’ (ODCP)
    largest payment area is benefits and has a robust multi-tier quality review program
    that includes in-depth annuitant case review as a part of its normal course of
    business. Through ODCP''s quality review program, significant numbers of annuitant
    cases are reviewed monthly and when errors are detected, benefit payments are
    corrected and debt collection activities begin, as applicable. In addition, all
    contract payments and Federal Employee Payments include a second level review
    prior to payment submission.  As such, ODCP had determined that a payment recapture
    audit is not cost effective as it is very unlikely that any additional overpayments
    would be identified, i.e., the cost would exceed the benefit.'
