- Answer: "The FCC had two program that were not compliant for the most recent reporting\
    \ period.  Those programs were the USF-Lifeline program which is in phase 2 since\
    \ it does not meet the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million in outlays.\
    \  The other program that was not in compliance in the Affordable Connectivity\
    \ program (ACP) which is currently in phase 1 reporting requirements.  \nUSF-Lifeline\
    \ - The Commission did not concur with the non-compliance finding for the Lifeline\
    \ program. The auditors’ recognized that no further action is required going forward.\
    \ However, we respectfully disagreed with the reasoning and conclusions that were\
    \ reached. The auditors based their finding on dated inputs (namely, an initial\
    \ response that gave a preliminary estimate done by our Administrator of what\
    \ might be a “potential” overpayment). In addition, the auditors appeared to consistently\
    \ disregarded subsequent written responses by the agency itself indicating that\
    \ the Commission had determined that the “potential” overpayment estimate the\
    \ auditors were relying on was vastly overstated. The consequence of the auditor’s\
    \ approach was to require the agency to report a substantial amount as improper\
    \ which the agency had repeatedly determined (as a regulatory matter) was not\
    \ in fact improper, undermining the accuracy of improper payment reporting.\n\
    As the FCC previously explained at length, this matter involved an unusual regulatory\
    \ wrinkle. The Commission had been considering a pending request from an eligible\
    \ telecommunications carrier (ETC) for a correction to the appendix to the June\
    \ 13, 2012 order granting it an ETC designation. The consideration of that request\
    \ was an exercise of the Commission’s regulatory authority, and a decision on\
    \ the application had to be made before a determination was made regarding whether\
    \ any payments were improper. The basic substance of that decision was made in\
    \ 2020—namely that the particular circumstances justified a nunc pro tunc grant\
    \ of authorization that would substantially reduce or eliminate any overpayment—and\
    \ was communicated to the auditors. Ultimately, on May 7, 2024, the agency issued\
    \ an order granting the request nunc pro tunc to June 13, 2012, the date of the\
    \ original grant. The effect of the order corrected the clerical filing error\
    \ made by the ETC and was retroactive to the date the original order and was issued.\
    \ Moreover, because the order was effective to the date of the original June 2012\
    \ order, the ETC provision of service in the relevant areas has giving rise to\
    \ the audit finding was authorized. Thus there were no improper payments and there\
    \ was never a need to report such. Per the auditors, on May 7, 2024, the FCC issued\
    \ two Orders and a related Consent Decree regarding this matter. The Orders and\
    \ Consent Decree had the effect of retroactively expanding the ETC’s jurisdiction\
    \ to the full area for which they had been operating. Therefore, the Orders had\
    \ the effect of retroactively making the balance of payments valid.\nACP - The\
    \ FCC underreported improper payment amounts of $6 million in its FY23 data that\
    \ was published on paymentaccuracy.gov. The recommendation by the auditors was\
    \ to develop and implement policies and procedures to identify, quantify, and\
    \ report any downward revisions that are submitted by providers resulting from\
    \ provider non-compliant conduct on paymentaccuracy.gov. Corrective actions will\
    \ include: 1) Every month, our Administrator will compile and report to the Office\
    \ of the Managing Director all ACP and EBB downward revisions received the prior\
    \ month that fall outside of the administrative filing window and 2) Develop an\
    \ ACP procedure to identify and report downward revisions that are submitted by\
    \ providers resulting from non-compliant conduct.\n"

- Answer: The FCC is committed to continually improving and strengthening the program
    integrity of its operations and the programs it oversees.  The Managing Director's
    performance plan will be modified to include measures related to strengthening
    program integrity and ensuring compliance with improper payment related laws and
    guidance.  Over the last several years the FCC has made numerous improvements
    in its programs to reduce improper payments.  This is reflected in the number
    of phase 2 programs the FCC has at this time.  A couple of years ago the FCC had
    four programs in phase 2 but next year we will only have two.
