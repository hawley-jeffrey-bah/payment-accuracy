- Answer: The NRC conducted a risk assessment in FY 2023 and discovered no significant
    improper payments and no high/ medium risk programs. Based on those results and
    the substantial cost of conducting recapture audits, the agency determined that
    recovery or recapture audits are not cost effective. The NRC conducts risk assessments
    every 3 years as required by PIIA.
