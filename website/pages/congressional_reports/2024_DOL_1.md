  Type: ITALICIZED
- Indent: 1
  Text: (i) a listing of each program or activity (with annual outlays greater than

  Text: (ii) a listing of any program or activity for which the executive agency makes

  Type: REGULAR
Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: 'Previously reporting programs are automatically risk assessed
    as "susceptible for significant IP" until or unless they report outlays or IP
    rates below the reporting threshold. PEUC and FPUC have been reported as part
    of the Federal-State Unemployment Insurance program per OMB instruction in previous
    years. FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering
    the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through
    its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the
    program earlier). Latent outlays for these temporary programs were all negative
    in FY24 due to overpayment recoveries and reconciled account adjustments. DOL
    is reporting these negative FY24 outlays here:

    FPUC = $-1,852.87M

    PEUC = $-269.75M

    PUA = $-1,737.83M


    DOL notified OMB of the decision to reclassify FPUC, PEUC, and PUA as Phase 0
    and is not expected to provide further reporting under M-21-19.


    See the Payment Integrity section of DOL''s Agency Financial Report for more information.'
