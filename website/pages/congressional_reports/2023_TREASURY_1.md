  Text: (ii) a listing of any program or activity for which the executive agency makes

  Type: REGULAR
Risks:
  AdditionalInformation: The IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CTC) conducted
    a risk assessment in FY 23 and although the risk assessment yielded a non-susceptible
    rating the IRS deems this program as susceptible to improper payments due to the
    similarity of this program with other programs that have high improper payment
    error rates. Tax year (TY) 2021 CTC was designed and implemented as part of the
    COVID-19 assistance programs; thus, the credit is similarly temporary in nature
    and has no basis for future improper payment estimates.  To estimate improper
    payment rates for refundable tax credits, the IRS must perform comprehensive audits
    over a large sample of tax returns.  Given the statutory timelines, IRS needs
    a minimum of three years to calculate an estimated improper payment rate for a
    given program, which in this case will be long after the TY 2021 CTC has ended.
