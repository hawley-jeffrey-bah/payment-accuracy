- Answer: 'Please see Management’s response to OIG’s FY23 PIIA Compliance Report,
    p.24-27: https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2024/22-24-007-13-001.pdf


    As described in the Executive Summary above, FY23 Payment Integrity reporting
    for PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility
    of the program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6,
    2021 (though many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program
    is expired in law and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is
    possible, nor is it possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under
    the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report  and PaymentAccuracy.gov
    reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further
    annual payment integrity reporting is possible. The amount of FY24 PUA outlays
    is $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which
    was developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this
    is not applicable to negative outlays.

- Answer: The OUI Administrator’s Performance Management Plan includes a Performance
    Requirement focused on Unemployment Compensation Program Integrity. It includes
    a state core performance measure for the UI Improper Payment rate whereby states
    are held to the federal expectation of an Improper Payment Rate that is less than
    10 percent. States failing to meet this expectation are subject to corrective
    action in order to correct the deficiency. A critical part of the agency’s approach
    to improving state performance is providing technical assistance and resources
    to support states in reducing the state Improper Payment rate, that contributes
    to the reduction in the federal Improper Payment rate.
