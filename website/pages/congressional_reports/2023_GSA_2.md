SurveyData:
- Answer: GSA's Recovery Audit contractor uses lease contracts and other lease documents
    to develop a detailed monthly rental schedule from lease commencement to most
    recent rent payment. This schedule is then compared to actual payments by month
    to determine if there are any discrepancies. If discrepancies are discovered,
    they are quantified and identified as to the nature and origin. A review of real
    estate tax adjustments is also done for each lease. Tax adjustments are reviewed
    for accuracy on the part of the Lessor’s submission of tax bills.
