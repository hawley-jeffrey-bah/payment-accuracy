  AdditionalInformation: 'The Department conducts comprehensive risk assessments on
    unique data characteristics and subpopulation groups.  Most of these groups are
    not expected to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments due
    to the strength of their internal controls which mitigate risk.  Programs deemed
    susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments must transition to Phase
    2.


    Actions were initiated in FY 2022 and built upon in FY 2023 through the successful
    restructuring of the Defense Health Agency Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The
    restructuring involved dividing the large Military Health Benefits program into
    six smaller, more manageable programs.  This strategic division allowed the Department
    to concentrate on the unique risks and controls associated with each program.  As
    a result of the restructure and targeted focus on program-specific risk factors
    and mitigating controls, the Department achieved PIIA compliance for the first
    time in the Military Health Benefits portfolio.  The Department then examined
    all programs to understand the correlation between individual subgroup error rates
    and their combined program error rates.  The Department found that robust internal
    control processes directly contributed to the individual program’s lower projected
    improper and unknown payment rates.  The Department-wide efforts in FY 2024 were
    focused on performing comprehensive risk assessments to document, identify, and
    classify the inherent risks and mitigating factors of payment types. As such,
    the Department leveraged this reorganization (16 total programs in FY 2023; 8
    Phase 1 and 8 Phase 2 to 42 Phase 1 and 6 Phase 2 programs in FY 2024) to develop
    and implement appropriate internal controls to reduce improper and unknown payments
    and uphold financial stewardship of taxpayer money. This strategy aligns with
    the OMB’s Joint Financial Management Improvement Program and demonstrates that
    PIIA compliance is achievable through the Department’s current internal control
    environment.
