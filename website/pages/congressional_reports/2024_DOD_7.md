- Answer: 'The DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) evaluated the compliance of the
    DoD’s 16 programs with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The
    audit for fiscal year (FY) 2023 revealed that eight Phase 1 programs successfully
    met the PIIA requirements. It also found that the eight Phase 2 programs were
    compliant with only five out of the six PIIA requirements.  On the sixth requirement,
    the DoD IG found the Department lacked an adequate methodology to ascertain the
    completeness of the DoD’s universe of transactions. Consequently, the Department
    was unable to publish reliable estimates.


    To address this, the Department is adopting two strategic paths to achieve PIIA
    compliance, incorporating the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123,
    Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches.
    These phases are not necessarily sequential or obligatory. A program can achieve
    and maintain PIIA compliance in either phase. This is accomplished by implementing
    corrective actions aimed at reducing both improper payments and unknown payments.
    The goal is to bring these payment rates below the PIIA statutory threshold or
    to a tolerable level.


    Path 1: Risk Assessments for PIIA Compliance (Phase 1)


    This path involves conducting comprehensive risk assessments on unique data characteristics
    and subpopulation groups. These groups are not expected to be susceptible to significant
    improper and unknown payments due to their internal controls designed to mitigate
    risk. In FY 2024, we restructured the department’s entire Payment Integrity portfolio
    based on the results and recommendations from the DoD OIG’s previous audits and
    interagency lessons learned.


    Path 2: Sampling & Estimation for PIIA Compliance (Phase 2)


    This path targets programs anticipated to exceed the OMB statutory threshold and
    likely to have significant improper and unknown payments. In FY 2023, the DoD
    OIG found that the Department produced unreliable improper payment and unknown
    payment estimates for the 13th consecutive year. Despite having statistically
    valid sampling plans, the Phase 2 programs failed due to the unsubstantiated payment
    population used to create the test samples.


    To rectify these deficiencies, the Department will establish a Payment Integrity
    Universe of Transactions (UoT) working group. This group aims to report reliable
    estimates by the FY 2025 reporting cycle, which will include a complete and reconciled
    payment population along with the previous valid sampling methodology. The working
    group’s goal is to develop and implement a standardized process to identify each
    program’s UoT population data characteristics, validate the completeness of the
    UoT payment population, and produce reliable improper and unknown payment estimates.

- Answer: 'The Department has appointed Senior Accountable Officials (SAO) who are
    collectively responsible for bringing the Payment Integrity programs into compliance
    with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Department’s Payment
    Integrity SAO Steering Committee (the Committee) is chaired by the Office of the
    Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial Officer and co-chaired
    by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy Director of Operations.
    The Committee also includes Senior Executive Service and Primary Action Officer
    Representatives from the Military Services and defense agencies. Officials with
    a direct role in the annual financial statement audit are incentivized and face
    consequences of program compliance through their performance agreements, which
    include compliance with policy and regulations, documenting transactions, identifying
    process and system weaknesses / reportable conditions, identifying root cause(s)
    of issues, and continuous process and internal control improvement. Officials
    with an indirect role in the annual financial statement audit are incentivized
    and face consequences of program compliance through their performance agreements
    which include: performing quarterly testing, reporting weaknesses, implementing
    timely corrective action plans and maintaining documentation to support financial
    transactions, implementing internal controls to ensure proper business procedures,
    supporting business improvement and accountability, and ensuring the workforce
    is trained on business effectiveness and accountability.'
