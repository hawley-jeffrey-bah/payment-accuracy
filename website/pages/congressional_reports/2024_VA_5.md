- Answer: "VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency;\
    \ therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered\
    \ using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail\
    \ below.\n\nVeterans Health Administration\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration\
    \ utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian\
    \ Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community\
    \ Care, and Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the\
    \ reimbursement was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical\
    \ records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.  The VA\
    \ Community Care review also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United\
    \ States Code § 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered\
    \ is in compliance with the authorization/referral.\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration\n\
    \nThe Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and\
    \ payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority\
    \ of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly\
    \ selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing,\
    \ and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration\
    \ performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other\
    \ potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and\
    \ recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the\
    \ Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional\
    \ Offices. \n\nOffice of Revolving Funds\n\nThe Office of Revolving Funds collaborates\
    \ with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply\
    \ Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and\
    \ a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with\
    \ appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of\
    \ collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution."

- Answer: VA programs that have determined that it is not cost-effective to conduct
    recovery audits have documented their justifications through a cost benefit analysis.
    For FY 2024, VA had 64 programs where conducting recovery audits would not be
    cost-effective. Whenever possible, VA utilizes quantitative factors, such as recovery
    amounts and actual costs incurred in recovery audits to determine if the benefits
    of a payment recovery audit program would exceed the costs associated with identification
    and recovery of overpayments. Lacking full quantitative data, VA will also utilize
    qualitative factors to determine if the benefits of a payment recovery audit program
    would exceed the costs associated with identification and recovery of overpayments.
    Qualitative factors evaluate the likelihood that identified overpayments would
    be recovered and the likelihood that the expected recoveries would be greater
    than the costs incurred to identify and recover overpayments. Each of the 64 programs
    determined that conducting a recovery audit would not be cost effective due to
    the costs or expected costs of the related recovery audit outweighing the collectable
    overpayments.
