    Description_Action_Taken: TRSUI calculates the provider distribution amounts based
      upon the minutes submitted and the current rate in the database. Calculations
      are randomly checked by signers when reviewing distribution documents. TRS will
      continue to rely on the system calculations unless errors arise.

    Description_Action_Taken: A discussion took place with the process owner of the
      TRS Provider Distribution process in September 2023. The process owner was instructed
      to update all TRS signers who approve payments when any file intervention must
      take place. It is rare for manual overrides to be made on the payment files
      but in the situation where it must be done, they must notify the signers of
      what manual overrides had to be performed as well as the impact of those overrides
      to ensure signers recalculate any calculations a 2nd and 3rd time.

    Mitigation_Strategy: app3_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: The error found was a result of manual intervention which is rare in the
      regular course business. TRS has adequate systems, human capital and internal
      controls over this process. The changes implemented will help to open communication
      for further questions and analysis if manual intervention is needed in the future.
    Needs2: No resources were requested in the most recent budget submission of the
      agency to establish and maintain the current internal controls.
    Sufficiency: The actions taken were aimed at making the Distribution signers responsible
      for approving payment aware when manual intervention takes place. Manual intervention
      is typically needed roughly once a year therefore automation is relied upon
      the majority of the time. Due to the limited times that this happens as well
      as the severity of the finding, no further automation or action is needed at
      this time.

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: FCC
    Answer: The main cause of the overpayments is related to inadequate documentation-
      assets.  The carrier is responsible for maintaining adequate documentation.  Documentation,
      such as invoices, work orders and other documentation related to assets, should
      be maintained to verify the asset transactions were recorded in the proper amount.  Documentation
      should be kept current and maintained by the carrier to allow for auditor review.

    Answer: Overpayments are outside of agency control because documentation is not
      required to receive payment.  Carriers are required to retain documentation  and
      to make it available upon request.  to demonstrate how it evaluates the usage
      of its subscribers.  USAC depends on the carrier to follow Commission rules
      related to non-usage. The collection of documentation in advance would prevent
      timely payment and would be cost prohibitive.

    Description_Action_Taken: The FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding in December
      2021 regarding the establishment of a USF Schools and Libraries Bidding Portal
      to enhance competitive bidding compliance. The Competitive Bidding Portal (WC
      Docket No. 21-455) rulemaking proceeding remains open at this time.

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: The Schools and Libraries program has the internal controls, human capital,
      information systems, and other infrastructure it requires to reduce improper
      payments to the target levels.
    Needs2: The Schools and Libraries program team did not identify additional resources
      needed to improve the overall structure of the program in its most current budget
      submission. USAC continues to work with the FCC to determine the gaps in its
      overall requirements.
    Sufficiency: "The top two causes for this year’s Improper Payments are related\
      \ to competitive bidding and invoicing error issues . As corrective actions,\
      \ the Schools and Libraries team is using data analytics to identify potential\
      \ competitive bidding issues, including potential conflicts of interest, prior\
      \ to issuing funding commitments. The team is also leveraging data analytics\
      \ to improve competitive bidding training and enhance compliance by adding content\
      \ regarding the minimum 28 day waiting period to select service providers, the\
      \ factors for assessing responsive bids, and document retention. \n\nThe Schools\
      \ and Libraries team is also adding additional preventative controls to proactively\
      \ identify and prevent the types of invoicing errors identified in the PQA assessments\
      \ from re-occurring in the future, and providing enhanced training regarding\
      \ the invoicing process.  To further address invoicing-related issues, USAC\
      \ is transitioning the Schools and Libraries program invoicing from the current\
      \ SL legacy systems to EPC, which is expected to help with identifying invoicing\
      \ issues before disbursements are issued.  The transition will occur between\
      \ November 3 and 7, 2023. \n\nThe current improper payment rate of 1.59% is\
      \ the lowest rate in the past eight years. From FY 2016 through FY 2022, the\
      \ Schools and Libraries program’s improper payment rate fluctuated from 2.97%\
      \ to 6.33%. When considering the overpayments within agency control, the Schools\
      \ and Libraries program’s improper payment rate is under the 1.5% threshold.\n"

    Answer: The majority of overpayments within the agency’s control stem from invoicing
      errors. The Schools and Libraries Program has taken a strategic, multi-pronged
      approach to reducing the risk around invoicing errors through realizing enhancements,
      and applying risk-based strategies to invoice procedure reviews and processes
      improvements. USAC’s Schools and Libraries Invoicing team is also leveraging
      open data sets and coding capabilities to improve the efficiency of invoicing-related
      validations.  In addition, the Schools and Libraries program team is also transitioning
      the invoicing process from the SL Legacy Systems to the E-Rate Productivity
      Center (EPC), which is also expected to help identify invoicing errors before
      disbursements are issued.  This systems consolidation transition is scheduled
      to occur between November 3 and 7, 2023.
