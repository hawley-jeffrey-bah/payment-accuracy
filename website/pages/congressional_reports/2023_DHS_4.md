    Description_Action_Taken: "The National Emergency Management Information System\
      \ (NEMIS) is a database system used to track disaster data for FEMA and recipient\
      \ emergency management offices. NEMIS supports emergency management at a disaster\
      \ site and enables FEMA to integrate mitigation and planning operations with\
      \ FEMA programs and disaster assistance. NEMIS enables data to be coordinated\
      \ throughout a disaster, from monitoring an incident to providing assistance\
      \ to communities affected by a disaster. \n\nThe NEMIS HMGP System is the Mitigation\
      \ module of NEMIS. This module provides a way to administer HMGP information\
      \ and grant applications. It interacts with some of the other NEMIS modules\
      \ such as Declaration, Preliminary Damage Assessment, and Emergency Support.\
      \ The NEMIS HMGP System can track project applications through workflow processes\
      \ and work packets. For each task in a workflow process, the system generates\
      \ a work packet. Users access the work packet to accomplish the steps in the\
      \ process. The NEMIS HMGP System executes work packets and workflow to assist\
      \ in automating the Eligibility Determination, Project Review and Approval,\
      \ Application Review and Approval, etc."

    Description_Action_Taken: Effective March 2023, FEMA released the updated Hazard
      Mitigation Assistance Program and Policy Guide (HMA Guide).  The purpose of
      the HMA Guide is to outline the policy and procedural requirements of FEMA’s
      mitigation grant programs over the lifecycle of a project or activity. The 2023
      HMA Guide update incorporates existing policies and guidance materials issued
      since 2015, simplifies and clarifies guidance, and incorporates strategic mitigation
      priorities.

    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2024
    Description_Action_Taken: FEMA will continue to provide regular training opportunities
      for regional partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.
      Training is specifically tailored to each audience and will continue to range
      from webinar recordings to on-demand workshops. Training offered through the
      Emergency Management Institute will also continue to offer self-paced courses,
      with a certificate of completion provided at the end. By continuing to train
      relevant parties and stakeholders, FEMA can continue to sustain and enhance
      program performance going forward, including the assurance that sufficient documentation
      is readily available.

    Action_Type: Audit
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA)
      requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities they administer
      and identify those determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments,
      estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates
      to Congress. In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular
      A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement, federal agencies
      are required to assess improper payments and report annually on their efforts.
      As a result of the testing procedures performed on the statistical sample of
      payments, FEMA identified minimal errors in the HMGP – Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program selected samples. Based on the extrapolated results, the program
      is not susceptible to significant improper payments as the estimated results
      are below both the 1.5% error rate and the $10M error amount thresholds established
      by OMB.


      In addition, FEMA performed an assessment of internal control over financial
      reporting including performing tests of operating effectiveness, for the FY
      2023 performance period. These internal control assessments included a review
      over Grants Management with no significant or material internal control issues
      arising related to HMGP.'

    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: 'Trainings are available and are designed to help FEMA
      regional partners and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments create
      effective hazard mitigation plans that meet FEMA’s requirements and reduce risk
      in their communities. Training is specifically tailored to each audience. Additionally,
      several advanced trainings and technical assistance related to pertinent areas
      in hazard mitigation assistance are available. These range from webinar recordings
      to on-demand workshops.


      FEMA continues to provide both classroom and online independent study courses
      for staff, as well as state, local, territorial, and tribal government employees
      to register for training through the Emergency Management Institute or through
      their State Mitigation Officer.


      The Emergency Management Institute serves as the national focal point for the
      development and delivery of emergency management training to enhance the capabilities
      of federal, state, local, tribal and territorial government officials, volunteer
      organizations and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters.
      Training classes through the Emergency Management Institute offer self-paced
      courses, with a certificate of completion provided at the end.'

    Answer: 'Payments are considered unknown payments when the associated recipient,
      and if applicable sub-recipient(s), fail to provide adequate supporting documentation
      in accordance with the grant agreement, such as amendments or price tables,
      or to support the disbursement drawdown amount. Without adequate supporting
      documentation, FEMA is unable to discern whether the payments were proper or
      improper as the disbursement could not reconciled to the terms and conditions
      of the agreement.  In order to assert to the appropriateness of the payment,
      FEMA generally requests the following information from the recipients:

      • FEMA State Agreement or Tribal Agreement

      • Completed Application (digital or otherwise) to include: the Application for
      Federal Assistance, Eligibility and Completeness Review Checklist for Project
      Sub-applications, and Any additional Required Attachments.

      • Supporting Payment Documentation


      FEMA conducted testing over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the Hazard Mitigation
      Grant Program - Disaster Supplemental Funds program between October 2022 and
      September 2023. During that review period, FEMA was unable to obtain sufficient
      documentation for three (3) transaction samples, related to Georgia and the
      U.S. Virgin Islands, out of the total sample size of 129 transactions. This
      inhibited FEMA''s ability to fully ascertain whether the payment for these specific
      transactions was proper or improper. These sample results were then extrapolated
      to the entire program population in accordance with the DHS statistical methodology.'

    Answer: "FEMA has engaged with recipients and process owners in monthly remediation\
      \ meetings to ensure that appropriate accountable officials are actively taking\
      \ actions to reduce improper payments and identify and categorize unknown improper\
      \ transactions as either proper or improper. If a transaction is deemed proper,\
      \ no further action is taken. If a transaction is deemed technically improper,\
      \ FEMA requires a corrective action be put in place in order resolve issues\
      \ surrounding procedures, policies, and trainings. If a transaction is deemed\
      \ improper and is associated with monetary loss, then the transaction is submitted\
      \ through the FEMA debt collection process including Notice of Potential Debt\
      \ Letters and Treasury Offset, if applicable. \n\nAs seen by the year over year\
      \ improvement in the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program - Disaster Supplemental\
      \ Funds program payment integrity reporting, these actions have been effective\
      \ and are expected to remain effective in mitigation of improper payments and\

    Answer: As indicated by the publication of no identified improper payments and/or
      unknown payments, the program has sufficiently proven that it is being executed
      with strong internal controls and sufficient human capital, information system,
      and infrastructure support. With no substantial changes to the program anticipated,
      CBP is confident that the current resourcing and internal control environment
      relevant to the Procurement, Construction, And Improvements - Disaster Supplemental
      Funds program will remain adequate to prevent and/or reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments.
