- Answer: To employ one GS 12 FTE to perform recapture audits will cost $93K to $122K
    per year. Given that the CSOSA has a very low risk of improper payment as a result
    of risk assessments done in FY2023, it is not cost beneficial for the CSOSA to
    employ an FTE to perform recapture audits. Another option is to contract out the
    recapture audits, below is a cost analysis using GSA contract rates for Castro
    & Company, LLC.  Based on the analysis below, it would cost CSOSA $41K to recapture
    any improper payments.  It is our determination then that it is not cost beneficial
    for the CSOSA to employ a contractor to perform recapture audits.
