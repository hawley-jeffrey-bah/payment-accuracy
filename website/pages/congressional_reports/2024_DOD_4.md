    Description_Action_Taken: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed
      civilian pay personnel offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are
      signed by their Command partners. The reason this is still causing technically
      improper payments is that the employee’s current three to five year tour includes
      prior year SF1190s that are not being properly signed.

    Completion_Date: The corrective action was not fully completed this reporting
      period
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The majority of the technically improper and unknown
      payments were due to Standard Form (SF) 1190s with missing authorizing signatures.
      SF-1190s substantiate overseas entitlements like the Living Quarters Allowance
      and the Foreign Post Allowance. The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency
      (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian pay personnel offices to ensure
      that block 25 of SF-1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses and block 26
      on all SF-1190 forms are signed by their Command partners. This is a requirement
      aligned with the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation Volume
      8, Chapter 3, subparagraph 4.1.1.  This mandate will prevent overseas entitlements
      from paying out to an employee without a properly signed SF1190; thus, substantially
      reducing (if not eliminating), technically improper and unknown payments in
      the coming years.


      Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly coordinated
      with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue to review
      and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with Command partners to resolve
      discrepancies as they are identified.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The overpayments annotated as ‘Monetary Loss within Agency Control’ (MLA)
      are within the  Army’s control because the root cause of the overpayments is
      the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) processing the incorrect information on
      standard HRC personnel actions on the Standard Form (SF); specifically, the
      Standard Form (SF) 50, “Notification of Personnel Action” and/or the SF1190,
      “Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report” required to authorize the
      payment(s).  In many of these cases a retroactive personnel action can be processed
      to correct the employees pay record and recoup the over payments.  The Army
      can avoid this type of overpayment by ensuring the information on the SF50 and/or
      SF1190 contain the accurate pay information and personal information prior to
      sending the information to the payroll system for payment.  The root cause is
      human error through the lack of attention to detail when reviewing the personnel
      actions.  The Army prevents the majority of these similar errors by double checking
      the personnel actions and ensuring the appropriate signatures are on the required
      forms prior to sending to the payroll system.

    Subheading: Technically Improper Payments
    Type: PERCENTAGE

    Answer: The technically improper payment errors for Army were caused by payments
      received from improperly signed Standard Forms (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances
      Application, Grant and Report” that are required to authorize the payment(s)
      for submission into the payroll system for processing.  The employees were all
      entitled to receive the payments; however, because the SF1190 was not signed
      by all required parties, the payment was improper.  From the Department of Defense
      (DoD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 8 , Chapter 3 in subparagraph
      4.1.1, “Foreign differentials and allowances are paid upon receipt through the
      interface of a properly completed and signed SF 1190, Foreign Allowances Application,
      Grant, and Report.” In 2021, at the direction of senior leadership in Human
      Resource, SF1190s did not require all signatures because the information was
      being sent from the Army Human Resource Command (HRC) system to the payroll
      system.  This guidance was not accurate and could not be authorized because
      it was not in alignment with DoD FMR Volume 8 “Civilian Pay Policy.”

    Subheading: Technically Improper Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The Army’s unknown payments are very similar in nature to the technically
      improper payment errors for Army and were caused by payments received from an
      improperly signed Standard Form (SF) 1190, “Foreign Allowances Application,
      Grant and Report” that were sent to the payroll system for payment but also
      were missing additional key supporting documentation (KSD) required to authorize
      and substantiate these payment types.  The employees were all entitled to receive
      the payments, however technically, because the SF1190 was not signed by all
      required parties, the payment is improper.  From the DoD Financial Management
      Regulation (DoD FMR) Volume Civilian Pay Policy. Foreign Area. Allowances and
      differentials payable to employees officially stationed in foreign areas are
      established by the Secretary of State and published in the Department of State
      Standardized Regulations (DSSR).

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
      offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
      partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is
      that the employee’s current three-to-five-year tour includes prior year SF1190s
      that not being properly signed. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed
      will be quickly coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct.
      CHRA will continue to review and correct existing SF 1190s, and coordinate with
      Command partners to resolve discrepancies as they are identified. Another strong
      indicator of the effectiveness of the planned corrective actions is they align
      with prior efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments. Specifically, the
      Army’s portion of the previous Department wide Civilian Pay program prior to
      the FY 2024 restructure was $108.57 million in FY 2023. In FY 2024 the restructured
      Army Civilian Pay program successfully reduced improper and unknown payments
      by $61.62 million down to $46.95 million. It is through this significant reduction
      in improper payments and subsequent ending amounts which are below the OMB statutory
      threshold that the Department is confident in the Army’s Civilian Pay corrective
      actions planned based off prior success.

    Answer: The Department of Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials
      Steering Committee (the Committee) was created in FY 2018, and it institutionalized
      a forum of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required
      by Appendix C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with
      the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired
      by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial
      Officer and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy
      Director of Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives
      from the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The Committee provides oversight
      to the DoD Payment Integrity program and drives action for compliance with the
      PIIA. More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of improper payments
      testing, the root causes of improper payments and appropriate actions to reduce
      them, payment recovery activities, and solutions to resolve DoD-wide audit findings
      and recommendations related to improper payments. Additionally, the Committee
      supports audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations,
      performance of risk assessments and oversees the identification of root cause(s)
      and the development and implementation of corrective actions to address areas
      of noncompliance.

    Answer: 'Internal Controls:

      The Army has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
      payments in its Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.
      Moreover, Federal Civilian Pay Service, which support the end-to-end delivery
      of payroll processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational
      Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements
      (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2024.


      Human Capital:

      The Army has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Civilian
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as the Army’s
      Civilian Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets
      and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Army has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has
      targeted. However, as technology advances, the Army and the Department continue
      to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Civilian Pay. Lastly, the Automated
      Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing
      System (which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department) received
      an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2024.

    Completion_Date: FY2025
    Description_Action_Taken: 'The Department’s unknown payments within the Civilian
      Pay Other Defense Organization were primarily a result of the lack of sufficient
      key supporting documentation (KSD) to substantiate whether payments were proper
      or improper at the time of post-payment reviews. Specifically, with payments
      related to the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense Health
      Agency (DHA), the Department was undergoing a consolidation of components at
      the DHA and the Civilian Humans Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the transition,
      certain individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed. This
      meant that the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting
      documentation, such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper
      and unknown payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024 who were unfamiliar
      with the procedure and process of procuring and providing supporting documentation.
      As a result, the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became
      arduous and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain,
      review, and ultimately provide KSD to substantiate payments. Examples of the
      missing KSDs are travel orders, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report
      (SF-1190), and Standard Form 50 (SF-50) Notification of Personnel Action to
      validate alimony garnishments, child support garnishments, market pay validation,
      location information, living quarters allowance (LQA).


      In FY 2025 DHA-MTF will evaluate and develop new processes to ensure the auditors
      and/or DFAS reviewers receive the correct key supporting documentation for the
      samples in a timely manner based off of the deliverable schedule.'

      year.


      2) This manual process carries a large risk of PII data spillage as the information

    Answer: The Department’s unknown payments were primarily a result of the lack
      of sufficient key supporting documentation (KSD) to substantiate whether payments
      were proper or improper at the time of post-payment reviews. Specifically, with
      payments related to the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense
      Health Agency (DHA), the Department was undergoing a consolidation of components
      at the DHA and the Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the
      transition, certain individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed.
      This meant that the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting
      documentation, such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper
      and unknown payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024. As a result,
      the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became arduous
      and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain, review,
      and ultimately provide KSD's to substantiate payments. Examples of the missing
      KSDs are travel orders, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report (SF-1190),
      and Standard Form 50 (SF-50) Notification of Personnel Action to validate market
      pay validation, location information and living quarters allowance (LQA).

    Answer: 'In regard to unknown payments above the statutory threshold of $100M
      under the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense Health Agency
      (DHA), the Department underwent a consolidation of components at the DHA and
      the Civilian Humans Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the transition, certain
      individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed. Due to a lack
      of training, the new personnel responsible for providing supporting documentation,
      such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper and unknown
      payments in FY 2024 were not sufficiently prepared to do so in a timely manner.


      DoDEA has a PIIA CAP written to address a lack of adequate key supporting documentation.  This
      corrective action is in process.  DoDEA is in the process of completing a system
      modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System (DAPS) which is to be
      housed on its internal ServiceNow network. With the upgrade, DoDEA will be adding
      the ability for CAC enabled signatures and dates. The completion of the system

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The Department’s Payment Integrity Commercial Pay – Mechanization of Contract
      Administration Services (MOCAS) program focuses on commercial vendors who deliver
      goods to or perform services for the DoD. The Department’s contractual payments
      require a three-way match between contract, invoice, and goods receipt and acceptance.
      Through internal controls and prepayment authorizations, overpayments are usually
      prevented. The Department's overpayments within the agency control under the
      Commercial Pay – MOCAS program in FY 2024 were mainly attributed to human input
      error. During the FY 2024 post-payment reviews of the program, it was found
      that payment terms were entered incorrectly into MOCAS when contract modifications
      were implemented. These overpayments are classified as within agency control
      because the contract input team has responsibility for ensuring that the payment
      terms are entered timely and accurately when a new contract or modification
      is received. The contract input team is also responsible for verifying the accuracy
      of the payment, to include payment terms, prior to release. The Department has
      several controls in place to prevent overpayments from occurring, including
      requiring that prior to payment, entitlement technicians complete a review of
      the contract and supporting documentation.  In addition, a procedure is in place
      for any payments greater than $1 million to undergo secondary review to ensure
      entitlements are legal, proper, and correct.  The contract input team also utilizes
      a daily report to track contracts and modifications received to ensure timely
      input into the system.  The above controls that failed are being reviewed to
      determine how they can be strengthened and to determine if additional training
      or controls are needed.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) overpayments are within the
      ARNG control to mitigate because the root cause of the overpayments is attributed
      to the state pay offices processing incorrect payment amounts. The ARNG is mitigating
      the risk of continued overpayments by providing virtual comprehensive training
      which is regularly attended by over 200 participants throughout the 50 States,
      U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia. Daily reviews are conducted
      by ARNG Financial Services to prevent these overpayments and in many of these
      cases a retroactive pay action can be processed to correct the service members
      pay record and recoup the overpayments. The vast majority of the ARNG overpayments
      are attributed to Basic Pay and Basic Allowance for Housing entitlements where
      the service member payment was incorrect due to the wrong rank and/or dependent
      status information. The ARNG in conjunction with United States Army Reserve
      (USAR) will start a Military pay certification program in quarter two of FY
      2025 to provide baseline Military pay training to new state pay technicians.
      In FY 2024, ARNG established two memorandums of agreement (MOAs) between the
      US Army Financial Management Command and the Defense Finance and Accounting
      Service to address service member payments processed by Army Military Pay Offices
      (AMPOs). Both MOAs stress the need for proper document retention to substantiate
      pay and the prevention of improper payments. MOAs also clearly outline what
      functions are the responsibility of state pay offices and AMPOs while a ARNG
      service member is on active duty or in a deployment status.

    Answer: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) payments annotated as technically
      improper payment errors were caused by housing allowance payments that were
      made without a current DA Form 5960 - Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH) Authorization
      And Dependency Declaration. DA Form 5960s were subsequently produced after the
      entitlement was fully substantiated; however, they were provided after the sampled
      payment was made, thus resulting in a technically improper payment. Additionally,
      in a few samples, while the correct key supporting documentation was provided,
      the signature on the forms were dated after the sampled payment date. In both
      examples, the entitlements that were attributed to the payment were corroborated;
      however, the process followed was not in adherence with Department of Defense
      polices and procedures. When this occurs, the Army takes the appropriate steps
      to correct the Soldier's pay record based on the Army regulations.

    Answer: The Military Pay Army National Guard (ARNG) program scenarios are broad
      and complex based upon the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction.
      For example, an unknown sample covering Military pay and allowances, could be
      for multiple reasons. ARNG payments are identified as unknown due to appropriate/applicable
      key supporting documents (KSDs) not readily available to be reviewed. The KSDs
      were not in the designated repositories and subsequently could not be provided
      prior to the review period ending. The ARNG will continue to research the appropriate
      repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve these errors.

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The vast majority of the Military Pay - Army National Guard are due to
      technical improper payments. The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) reduced
      its processing error rate from 10.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2023 to 5.1% in FY
      2024.  This error rate is well below the 10% acceptable risk by the Department.
      To continue to mitigate improper payment error rates, monthly virtual training
      will continue to be provided by ARNG Financial Services to the 50 States, Territories
      and the District of Columbia. These corrective action events trainings have
      been instrumental in the overall reduction of the improper and unknown payment
      error rates from FY2023 to FY2024. These events provide in-depth Military pay
      training and provide pay technicians with the information needed to accurately
      and efficiently process Military pay. Extra emphasis will be placed on the processing
      of housing allowances and the subsequent requirement to properly retain applicable
      documents. Additionally, ARNG in conjunction with the United States Army Reserve,
      will start a military pay certification program in Q2 of FY2025 to provide in
      person baseline military pay training to new state pay technicians. This training
      will be offered quarterly to maintain pay proficiency across the 50 States,
      Territories, and the District of Columbia (in addition to the virtual monthly
      trainings that are already provided).

    Answer: The Defense Payment Integrity Senior Accountable Officials Steering Committee
      (the Committee) was created in fiscal year 2018 and it institutionalized a forum
      of accountability to oversee and guide the Department’s actions required by
      Appendix C of the OMB Circular Number A-123 to achieve full compliance with
      the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA). The Committee is chaired
      by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial
      Officer and co-chaired by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Deputy
      Director, Operations. It also includes Senior Executive Service representatives
      from the Military Services and defense agencies. The Committee provides oversight
      to the Department of Defense (DoD) Payment Integrity programs and drives action
      for PIIA compliance. More specifically, the Committee evaluates the status of
      improper payments testing; the root causes of improper payments and the appropriate
      actions to reduce them; payment recovery activities; and solutions to resolve
      DoD-wide audit findings and recommendations related to improper payments. Additionally,
      it supports audits related to improper payments, reviews audit recommendations,

    Answer: 'Internal Controls: The Army National Guard (ARNG) has internal controls
      in place that support the reduction of improper payments in its program to the
      levels the Department has targeted. Moreover, the ARNG pay offices support the
      end-to-end delivery of payroll processing services, received a modified System
      and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards
      for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in fiscal year (FY) 2024.


      Human Capital: The ARNG has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments
      in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. As the
      ARNG''s Military Pay program evolves and Department of Defense operations change,
      additional skill sets, and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and
      advance the program. However, implementing the new strategy for achieving compliance
      will necessitate a considerable increase in payment sampling which will require
      additional human capital working hours to implement.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure: The ARNG has the information systems
      and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. However, as technology
      advances, the Army and the Department continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency
      of Military Pay through implementation of new integrated pay and personnel processing
      systems. The Army continues to make progress towards fully implementing the
      Integrated Pay and Personnel System – Army (IPPS-A) in the future. Under IPPS-A,
      improper payments will be reduced because entitlements will be directly inputted
      into the Military Pay payroll system by an authorized personnel source thereby
      eliminating all manual processing. Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System,
      the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System, which
      are the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received an unmodified

    Answer: 'The primary cause for technically improper payments was travelers, reviewing
      officials, and approving officials/certifying officers not attaching or ensuring
      valid receipts were uploaded in the Defense Travel System (DTS) to support travel
      expenses claimed (e.g., airfare, rental car, and lodging). The receipts were
      invalid because they did not contain the elements for a valid receipt in accordance
      with the Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 9, "Travel
      Policy" and the Defense Travel Management Office’s DTS Guide 3: Vouchers.


      Another cause was the Army Command’s travel personnel overlooked the travel

    Answer: "The root cause for unknown payments were the travelers’ Defense Travel\
      \ System (DTS) claims did not contain the corroborating key supporting documentation\
      \ (KSD). Without the travel claim KSDs, the validity of the payment can not\

      \ orders to perform TDY missions at other location(s), statement or certificate\
      \ for non-availability (SNA/CNA) or DD Form 1351-5, for lodging/meals; lodging\

      \ and a furnished memorandum instead of the actual deployment order. At the\
      \ time of the voucher review, the accuracy of these TDY claims could not be\

      and lodging) while on temporary duty. However, the DTS approving officials/certifying
      officers approved these DTS vouchers as pay-ready for reimbursement when the
      vouchers lacked proper documentation in accordance with the DoD FMR. In Review

    Answer: Overpayments associated with the Department of the Air Force (DAF) Defense
      Travel System (DTS) vouchers are within the DAF’s overall control and responsibility.   The
      DAF is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of its payments to include DTS
      travel vouchers.  There were several contributing factors identified. The DAF’s
      current construct does not allow for a centralized approach to DTS authorization
      and voucher management for Temporary Duty (TDY) members.  The agency has adopted
      a decentralized approach to allow each unit to handle their own travel needs.  Unfortunately,
      we have discovered this approach correlates to an increased number of approving
      officials (AOs) who are not fully aware of the requirements for validating meal
      authorizations and appropriate lodging rates in the per diem screen of DTS,
      which make up a large portion of our overpayments. The DAF has taken action
      to ensure all newly appointed AOs and all AOs identified as having approved
      3 or more improper payments receive mandatory initial and/or remedial AO training
      to reduce improper payments.  Further, all AOs who do not comply with the training
      requirements, will have their AO permissions removed within 10 days of the established
      training deadline.

    Answer: "The primary cause for the Department of the Air Force (DAF)'s Defense\
      \ Travel System (DTS) technically improper payments was the submission of invalid\
      \ receipts.  Hotel, airline, rental car, and other receipts were not in the\
      \ proper format or were missing critical information as required by the Department\
      \ of Defense (DoD) Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR).  For example,\
      \ hotel receipts provided did not have zero balance indicated, and often rental\
      \ car and airline reservation or agreements were provided in place of receipts\
      \ or invoices. Upon further analysis, it was discovered that many travelers\
      \ and/or approving officials did not: \na.\tFully understand, implement or enforce\
      \ the requirements for a valid receipt as defined by the DOD FMR, and \nb.\t\
      Correctly load their reservation document or rental car agreement rather than\
      \ their official invoice for airfare and rental cars.  It was also discovered\
      \ many approving officials were not \nc.\tProperly validate meal authorizations\

      \ DTS is created after the fact; therefore, the statements in DTS were missing\
      \ who issued the order and when to fully substantiate the authorization in DTS.\n\
      An example of a recurring error is as follows:  \n\tThe travel authorization\
      \ was approved after the temporary duty (TDY) dates. Verbal authorization information\
      \ or documentation is needed that includes the approving officials name and\
      \ date the verbal authorization was given to proceed on travel. The orders have\
      \ an issue date which is after the TDY was completed. A Verbal Order of the\
      \ Commander (VOCO) date is needed for incurred expenses to be reimbursable.\

    Answer: "The Department has the internal controls in place to support the reduction\
      \ of improper payments in the Defense Travel System (DTS) program to the levels\
      \ the Department has targeted. However, a material weakness in Contract Administration\
      \ related to improper payments was reported in fiscal year (FY) 2021 through\
      \ the Risk Management/Internal Control Program. Moreover, the Office of the\
      \ Under Secretary of the Defense (Comptroller) provides ongoing oversight to\
      \ ensure material weaknesses are resolved by their target dates and coordination\
      \ continues between the Risk Management/Internal Control Program and the Payment\
      \ Integrity Program to leverage best practices in internal controls. \n\nHuman\
      \ Capital:\nThe Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper\
      \ payments in the DTS program to the levels the Department has targeted. However,\
      \ as the DTS program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets\
      \ and personnel resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.\n\
      \nInformation Systems and Other Infrastructure:\nThe Department has the information\
      \ systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the\
      \ DTS program to the levels the Department has targeted. The Defense Travel\
      \ System Administration and Operational Support Services, received an unmodified\
      \ System and Organizational Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on\
      \ Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 in FY 2023. The general\
      \ and application controls of the DTS were included in the scope of the DMDC\
      \ SSAE No. 18 examination. Integrated Accounts Payable System all received unmodified\
      \ SOC 1 Type 2 reports under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2022. And, the Computerized Accounts\
      \ Payable System, DFAS DAI, and DCMA Contract Pay each\nreceived modified SOC\
      \ 1 Type 2 reports under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. Moreover, the Automated Disbursing\
      \ System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the Deployable Disbursing System\
      \ (which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department) received an\
      \ unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. As technology\
      \ advances, the Department continues to consider ways to improve the accuracy\
      \ and efficiency of travel pay through implementation of new commercial and\
      \ entitlement processing systems and enhancements to existing systems."
