- Answer: Improper payments oversight falls under the OPPCFO’s management and the
    internal control program, while improper payment assessments and implementing/maintaining
    successful internal controls is a shared responsibility across OPPCFO and SBA’s
    program offices.  As such, within the SBA’s SOPs, there are direct linkages between
    senior management and their responsibilities for maintaining not only an effective
    internal control system, but also complying with laws and regulations.  For example,
    under SOP 00 02, Internal Control System, management board members and district
    directors are responsible for maintaining effective systems of internal controls.  Additionally,
    under SOP 20 31, Internal Control, senior management is responsible for establishing
    and monitoring, within their areas of responsibility, an internal control structure
    that provides reasonable assurance that operations are being run in an efficient
    and effective manner and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
