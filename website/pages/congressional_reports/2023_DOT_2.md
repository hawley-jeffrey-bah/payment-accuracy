SurveyData:
- Answer: "DOT’s Payment Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating improper\
    \ payment reviews, reporting results, and monitoring the progress of corrective\
    \ actions in accordance with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019, Office\
    \ of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for\
    \ Payment Integrity Improvement, and OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting\
    \ Requirements. Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed\
    \ the recovery audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2022 through\
    \ March 2023. \n\nDOT considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal\
    \ year 2023 audit to be recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s\
    \ service provider, typically recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly\
    \ from the payee, by offsetting a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt\
    \ to the Department of Treasury’s Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover\
    \ overpayments directly from the payees. In fiscal year 2023, recaptured overpayments\
    \ resulting from DOT errors were returned to the program or activity’s original\
    \ purpose."
