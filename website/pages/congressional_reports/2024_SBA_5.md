SurveyData:
- Answer: In FY 2024, the SBA did not conduct any recovery audits. In prior years,
    the SBA has conducted cost-benefit analyses on programs subject to payment recapture
    audit, and deemed the costs to perform a payment recapture audit outweighed the
    benefits of the audit. Although a payment recapture audit is not conducted, SBA
    makes every effort to recover any improper payments identified through the improper
    payment review process or other internal review process.
