SurveyData:
- Answer: "The most consistent reason for overpayments is failure to follow documented\
    \ processes and regulations. improvements have been made to the training programs\
    \ to address the internal control failure. Additionally, programs implement procedural\
    \ changes to combat overpayment. One program reported that overpayment stemmed\
    \ from a technical issue that resulted in the duplication of the payment file.\
    \ While this issue was outside of the program’s control, a new process was implemented\
    \ to oversee the automatic process. \n"

- Answer: "Overall, programs typically utilize the same recovery techniques when recovering\
    \ improper payments as those utilized with standard receivables.  \nFarm Service\
    \ Agency and Commodity Credit Corporation programs establish an audit receivable\
    \ that is eligible for offset from any future payments. At 120 days delinquent,\
    \ the receivable is referred to the Department of Treasury for collection, as\
    \ required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1986 and the 2022 Financial\
    \ Data Transparency Act. \nSimilarly, the Forest Service, Rural Development, and\
    \ Risk Management Agency  issue receivables when improper payments are discovered.\
    \ Consistent electronic follow-ups are performed to ensure timely recovery of\
    \ improper payments. \n"

- Answer: 'Programs that determined that it was not cost effective to conduct recovery
    audits in certain programs based this decision on several factors including:


    •The effective processes the program(s) already has in place to identify, recover,
    and report improper payments;

    • Low improper payment rate;

    • The insignificant amount of improper payments recaptured using the Department’s
    recovery audit program; and

    • If the program contracted for its own audit recovery program, the time and effort
    to conduct the program would not be commiserate with the funds recaptured.'
