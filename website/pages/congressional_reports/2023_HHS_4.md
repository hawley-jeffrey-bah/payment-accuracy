    Description_Action_Taken: HHS's planned corrective action for states reporting
      in FY 2023 Child Care and Development Fund program include continuing to provide
      targeted technical assistance based on the reported specific causes of errors
      for the states.  Some states reporting in FY 2023 have planned corrective actions
      that include fixing system errors and implementing new, enhanced systems; providing
      guidance, training, and technical assistance to eligibility staff; reviewing
      and updating policies and procedures manuals and providing policy clarifications
      to eligibility staff;  meeting with state eligibility agencies to discuss errors;
      and continuing audit, monitoring, and review efforts.

    Action_Type: Training
    Completion_Date: FY2023 Q4
    Description_Action_Taken: HHS utilized training as a corrective action in the
      Child Care and Development Fund program.  HHS conducted site visits with states
      needing assistance to address root causes; provided states with technical assistance
      on policy and procedure changes to meet the Child Care and Development Block
      Grant Act of 2014 requirements; delivered technical assistance to states updating
      or developing IT systems that will improve practices and reduce errors; and
      conducted joint case reviews with all reporting states, which included state
      and federal staff.  HHS also funded the Office of Child Care’s National Center
      on Subsidy Innovation and Accountability to provide technical assistance to
      states and territories on program integrity and accountability, including targeting
      technical assistance to states to support reauthorization requirements.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp3_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 and Child Care
      and Development Fund regulations (2016) required states to create and adopt
      new policies and procedures. State recipients have been implementing large-scale
      changes to their child care programs and HHS anticipated that the improper payment
      rate could be affected as states work to meet the new requirements.  HHS anticipated
      reestablishing the baseline and setting a reduction target in FY 2023, however,
      limitations and restrictions due to COVID-19 impacted states’ abilities to complete
      planned actions as states were granted needed flexibility.  The effects of COVID-19
      will continue to impact the improper payment rate in the FY 2023 measurement
      and beyond, making it challenging to determine a target rate.  For these reasons,
      HHS is still working to establish a baseline, develop a tolerable rate, and
      therefore assess needs with respect to internal controls, human capital and
      information systems and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments and
      unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate.
    Needs2: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Child Care and Development
      Fund program, therefore, the program did not request resources in the most recent
      budget submission to establish and maintain internal controls to reduce improper
      payments and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: HHS's level of planned and completed corrective actions address the
      causes of the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments in the Child Care and Development
      Fund program and is proportional to the severity of the associated amount and
      rate and root causes for several reasons.  Historically, training, and targeted
      technical assistance have been the primary methods used to address improper
      and unknown payments in the program. The improper payment rate has shown a steady
      decline since FY 2020, most recently decreasing from 3.96% in FY 2022 to 3.55%
      in FY 2023.  The maintenance of an error rate that is consistently below the
      statutory threshold indicates that this approach is appropriately addressing
      the root causes of the errors and are successful in reducing Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments.  HHS will continue to receive specific root causes of
      errors and associated corrective actions from each reporting state under the
      policies unique to the state. Using this data, HHS will continue to provide
      targeted technical assistance to address the specific causes of errors for the
      state.  Further, the requirement for states with improper payment rates exceeding
      10 percent to submit a formal Corrective Action Plan, and HHS’s process of working
      closely with states under a formal corrective action plan or needing assistance
      to address root causes of errors will continue to be a priority for the Agency.

    Answer: Overpayments are outside of HHS's control because the Child Care and Development
      Fund is a federally funded, state-administered block grant program, with funds
      awarded to states/recipients who then disburse funds to sub-recipients.  Under
      the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have flexibility
      within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including subsidy payment rates,
      co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining
      eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  Each state has maximum flexibility
      in developing the Child Care and Development Fund programs and policies that
      best suit the needs of children and families within that state.

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: HHS
    Answer: Payments are unknown for the Child Care and Development Fund program because
      at the time of the HHS review, the available documentation was not sufficient
      to determine if the payment was proper or improper.  Under the Child Care and
      Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have maximum flexibility in developing
      the Child Care and Development Fund  programs and policies that best suit the
      needs of children and families within that state.   As such, key eligibility
      documentation requirements are controlled by states, and thus the specific documentation
      that the state failed to provide that make payments unknown vary across states.  For
      example, one of the key federal policy levers is income thresholds for determining
      eligibility, for which some states require paystubs to verify income.  In instances
      where the paystub is missing and there are no other mechanisms in place to verify
      income, it cannot be determined if the payment was proper or improper.

  - Agency: HHS
    Answer: The specific documentation that the state failed to provide for the Child
      Care and Development Fund program varies from state to state.  This is because
      under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, states have maximum
      flexibility in developing the Child Care and Development Fund  programs and
      policies that best suit the needs of children and families within that state.  Further,
      states have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers—including
      subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income
      thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.  Since
      the state did not have sufficient documentation in accordance with the state's
      specific requirements, we were unable to conclude if the payment was proper
      or improper.

    Needs1: HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as
      this is the first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown
      Payment estimate for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates
      determining a tolerable rate in the future once more performance data is available.  Once
      HHS establishes a baseline and develops a tolerable rate for the Head Start
      program, we can assess needs with respect to internal controls, human capital
      and information systems and other infrastructure to reduce improper payments
      and unknown payments to a determined tolerable rate.
    Needs2: HHS did not request resources in the most recent budget submission of
      the agency specific to establishing and maintaining controls in the Head Start
      program to reduce the Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to the tolerable
      rate.  HHS has not determined a tolerable rate for the Head Start program as
      this is the first year for calculating and reporting an Improper and Unknown
      Payment estimate for the program under the new methodology.   HHS anticipates

      HHS develops a tolerable rate for the Head Start program, we will assess resource
      needs to reduce improper payments and unknown payments to a determined tolerable
      rate, and include in the HHS budget submission if warranted.
    Sufficiency: HHS's planned and completed actions address the causes of the Improper
      Payments and Unknown Payments because they focus on the specific errors identified
      during the review.  Targeted technical assistance is provided to address the
      underlying causes of the errors, along with follow-up action to ensure that
      corrective action was taken to address the root cause of the Improper Payments
      and Unknown Payments in the Head Start program.  Based on our initial assessment,
      these actions are deemed proportional to the severity of the associated amount
      and rate of the root cause since the Improper Payments error rate for the Head
      Start program is 1.83% and the Unknown Payments error rate is 3.28%, resulting
      in an overall error rate of 5.10%, which is below the statutory threshold of
      10%.

    Answer: Payments are unknown for the Head Start program because at the time of
      the HHS review, the available documentation was not sufficient to determine
      if the payments were proper or improper.  There were two Head Start recipients
      that fell into this category.  In one instance, the Head Start recipient was
      the subject of an active fraud investigation and thus could not be tested.  In
      the other instance, the Head Start recipient failed to provide sufficient documentation
      at the level of detail necessary to conduct the review.

    Answer: HHS is unable to determine the specific documentation that the Head Start
      recipient failed to provide.  In one instance, the limitation was imposed because
      the Head Start recipient is the subject of an active fraud investigation, which
      prevented HHS from obtaining any information from the recipient.  In the other
      instance, the Head Start recipient did not provide transaction level detail
      to support expenditures therefore, HHS could not determine the nature of the
      individual expenditures or the documentation required.  In both scenarios, HHS
      is unable to determine if the payment is proper or improper without the documentation
      to conclude if the expenditures qualified as an allowable use of funds under
      the Head Start program.

      The majority of the overpayments identified resulted from the agency not following

      include improper calculation of annual income amounts by not conducting those
      calculations in accordance with established guidelines and accepting documentation

      when a legally applicable requirement related to payment conditions is not satisfied
      by the Exchange, however, there was no impact on the total advance premium tax
      credit.  Per 45 CFR §155.330 (d), the Federally-facilitated Exchange must periodically
      examine available data sources to identify changes in death, Medicare, Medicaid,
      and CHIP. In this scenario, the Federally-facilitated Exchange conducted periodic
      data match checks against the Social Security Administration for death data
      during the benefit year.  A large volume of periodic data match checks occurring
      simultaneously caused the technical limitation which prevented the generation
      of the Death Periodic Data Matching verification request for an enrollee   As
      a result of an enrollee was omitted from the batch in error.

      not appropriately screened by the state; providers not enrolled; and/or providers

      HHS's primary strategy to recover Part C overpayments. RADV uses medical record
      reviews to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses submitted by Medicare Advantage
      Organizations (MAOs) for risk-adjusted payments. HHS also performs audits of
      MAOs to detect non-compliance with program integrity requirements, which can
      lead to additional improper payments. HHS also maintained formal outreach to

    Answer: The primary causes of Medicare Advantage (Part C) improper payments are
      medical record discrepancies and insufficient documentation to determine whether
      payment was proper or improper.  Medicare Advantage Organizations are the entities
      responsible for the maintenance and submission of accurate data for payment
      determinations, and attest to this upon submission.  The MAO is also responsible
      for collecting and maintaining the source documentation (medical records) necessary
      to validate the data used in payment determinations. Medical records, the source
      document, are not submitted to the agency at the time of making payment determinations.

    Sufficiency: 'HHS continues to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions
      and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments and unknown payments
      agency-wide as evidenced by its two consecutive year of reductions in the improper
      payment rate. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Medicare FFS improper
      payment rate decreased from 7.46% to 7.38%.


      The actions taken and planned to address the root causes of the improper payment
      rate and are proportional to the associated amount and address the root causes
      of the improper payments. For example, in FY 2023, the primary drivers of the
      improper payment rate are Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), Hospital Outpatient,
      and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) claims. To drive down the improper
      payment rate, HHS continues nationwide prior authorization for hospital outpatient
      claims. Medicare review contractors continue to identify and prevent improper
      payments due to documentation errors in error-prone claim types, including SNF,
      hospital outpatient and IRF. HHS also announced an expansion of its home health
      review choice demonstration to a sixth state and started a review choice demonstration
      for inpatient rehabilitation facility services. HHS will continue to develop
      and prioritize additional CAPs in FY 2024 based on the FY 2023 improper payment
      rate data.

    Sufficiency: HHS will continue to prioritize and implement effective corrective
      actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments and unknown
      payments agency-wide as evidenced by its lower error rate of 3.72%.  The actions
      taken and planned to address failure to access data are proportional to the
      improper payment rate and address the root causes of the improper payments.
      For example, HHS audits Part D plan sponsors to address high-risk drugs and
      educate sponsors on fraud, waste, and abuse. These audits have varying scopes
      but share the goal of reducing and recovering improper Part D payments. Future
      audits may account for areas in which missing or invalid documentation has been
      found to be a persistent issue. HHS also uses education and outreach as a key
      tool to reduce improper payments. Annually, the agency identifies the root causes
      of improper payments and develops specific corrective actions to address them.

      \ anomalies for in-depth analysis and investigation to rectify potential errors\
      \ or clarify why the anomaly is not an error. \n\nAs identified in the previous\
