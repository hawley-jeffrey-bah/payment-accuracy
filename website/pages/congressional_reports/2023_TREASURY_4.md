  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: The IRS has what is needed with respect to internal control, human capital
      and information system and other infrastructure to reduce Additional Child Tax
      Credit (ACTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The
      issue with ACTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around ACTC and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff.
    Needs2: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
      its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number
      of correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits,
      including the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). Focusing on helping taxpayers
      submit accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing
      administrative burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
    Sufficiency: The IRS has the ability to identify Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC)
      errors by type. Correlating remediation efforts to success is challenging. Given
      its limited authority to directly prevent and stop these errors, the IRS focuses
      on positively influencing taxpayer behavior and working with paid preparers
      and tax preparation software/online filing service providers. Further, the IRS
      has sought legislative authority to enhance verification procedures for taxpayers
      claiming ACTC and penalties for individuals or entities found guilty of abusing
      RTCs. Taxpayer education and outreach efforts, such as the IRS's annual Dependent
      Database (DDb) meetings, inform taxpayers about program eligibility requirements.

    Answer: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), to include the lack of
      a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax
      returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of ACTC improper payments. Specifically,
      at the time of filing/payment the IRS cannot readily authenticate eligibility
      for the credit, i.e., whether a claimed child in fact qualifies, meeting the
      many nuances of the Age, Relationship, Residency and Joint Return Tests. This
      is due to the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available
      or does not exist. In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer
      income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income where
      the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. Finally,  each year
      there are many taxpayers who claim and receive ACTC for the first time, who
      have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory structure and
      design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including ACTC, prevents
      the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior to making a
      refund.

    Sufficiency: The annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, collaborations/data
      sharing with other federal agencies and outreach/education efforts are adequate
      measures because they will continue to aid the Service in mitigating the impact
      of the root causes. Much of the difficulty administering the American Opportunity
      Tax Credit (AOTC) derives from the complexity of its statutory eligibility requirements,
      many of which are known only to the taxpayer and cannot be independently confirmed
      using third-party corroborating data. Likewise, the primary root causes of improper
      payments of the AOTC are the  inability to authenticate eligibility at return
      filing because the data needed does not exist, and taxpayer income misreporting
      related to self-employment income and other income where the income is not reported
      to the IRS by a third party. Nevertheless, the IRS has a strong and effective
      internal control environment around refundable tax credit programs and makes
      decisions based on overall cost-benefit considerations.

      of a preapproval process and IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that
      tax returns are accurate, is the primary root cause of AOTC improper payments.
      Specifically, at the time of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily authenticate
      eligibility i.e., whether the dependent/student in fact qualifies, meeting the
      many nuances of the qualifying education expenses. This is due to the fact that
      the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does not exist.
      In addition, data is not available for IRS to identify taxpayer misreporting
      of eligibility requirements, such as qualifying tuition expenses, Adjusted Gross
      Income, filing status, deductions, exemptions, and credits. Finally, each year
      there are many taxpayers who receive AOTC for the first time, who have to understand

    Mitigation_Strategy: app5_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: The IRS has support with respect to internal control, human capital and
      information system and other infrastructure to reduce Net Premium Tax Credit
      (PTC) Improper Payments and Unknown Payments to a tolerable rate. The issue
      with PTC is statutory program design and reliance on taxpayer self-certification.
      The IRS has a strong internal control environment around PTC  and makes decisions
      based on overall cost-benefit considerations, with a well-trained, technically
      capable program staff.
    Needs2: The IRS is realigning resources internally to accelerate progress against
      its strategic priorities. The IRS will substantially be reducing the number
      of correspondence audits focused specifically on certain refundable credits,
      including the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). Focusing on helping taxpayer submit
      accurate filings upfront will increase payment accuracy while reducing administrative
      burdens for the IRS and the tax filer.
    Sufficiency: The IRS has the ability to identify Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC)
      errors by type. Correlating remediation efforts to success is challenging. Given
      its limited authority to directly prevent and stop these errors, the IRS focuses
      on positively influencing taxpayer behavior and working with paid preparers
      and tax preparation software/online filing service providers. Further, the IRS
      has sought legislative authority to enhance verification procedures for taxpayers
      claiming the PTC. Taxpayer education and outreach efforts, such as the IRS's
      annual Dependent Database (DDb) meetings, inform taxpayers about program eligibility
      requirements.

    Answer: The challenge in administering refundable tax credits (RTCs) is that RTCs
      do not have the characteristics of a typical payment program. The regulatory
      structure of the Net Premium Tax Credit (PTC), to include the lack of a preapproval
      process (notwithstanding anything that occurs in the Advance PTC process) and
      IRS reliance on taxpayer self-certification that tax returns are accurate, is
      the primary root cause of Net PTC improper payments. Specifically, at the time
      of filing/payment, the IRS cannot readily verify certain information, i.e.,
      taxpayer income misreporting related to self-employment income and other income
      where the income is not reported to the IRS by a third party. This is due to
      the fact that the data needed to validate eligibility is not available or does
      not exist. In addition, each year there are many taxpayers who receive PTC for
      the first time, who have to understand and apply complex requirements. The statutory
      structure and design for administering refundable tax credit refunds, including
      Net PTC, prevents the IRS from verifying or validating such pertinent data  prior
      to making a refund.
