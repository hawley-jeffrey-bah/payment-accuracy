    Description_Action_Taken: 'Army Civilian Field Offices were unable to provide
      complete SF 1190s with authorizing signatures. Addressing the root causes for
      the samples determined Technically Improper and Unknown Payment estimates that
      combined is above the statutory threshold ($100M). The Corrective Action Plan
      (CAP) is a combination of both mitigation strategies and corrective actions
      aimed at reducing the likelihood of Technically Improper or Unknown Payment
      errors occurring during the payment process.  As of 24 June 2022, U.S. Army
      Civilian Human Resource Agency (CHRA) provided a directive for all civilian
      pay personnel offices to ensure that block 25 of SF 1190s requesting reconciliation
      of expenses (TQSA and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by Army
      Command partners. Any SF 1190s that are currently being processed will be quickly
      coordinated with Army Commands to ensure the forms are correct. CHRA will continue
      to review the requirements that may result from the ongoing audit, (i.e. correcting
      existing SF 1190s), and will coordinate with our Command partners appropriately.


      An additional Department CAP has been created specifically for Department of
      Defense Education Activity (DoDEA). A DoDEA employee must complete a Standard
      Form(SF)-1190 in order to apply for authorization and payment for overseas allowances.  Completion
      of the SF-1190 provides the necessary information to determine the correct amount
      for all overseas allowances.  During the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 audit, the SF-1190
      was provided and reviewed by DFAS. It was found that the SF-1190 did not have
      consistent signatures and dates on the standard forms. DoDEA is in the process
      of completing a system modernization of the DoDEA Allowance Processing System
      (DAPS) which is to be housed on their internal ServiceNow network. With the
      upgrade, DoDEA will be adding the ability for CAC-enabled signatures and dates.'

    Description_Action_Taken: The FY 2023 Corrective Action Plan for the Civilian
      Pay Program was developed to address the technically improper payments due to
      the lack of or inability to provide adequate key supporting documentation for
      disbursements from samples selected during post pay review of the program.  The
      error reason for the majority of the civilian payments was that the SF 1190s
      did not have an authorizing signature.

      2 and Quarter 3 SF1190s to ensure that the modernization CAC enabled signatures
      and dates are operating effectively.


      For the Army Per the CHRA Leadership, effective immediately, the CHRA team will
      ensure that block 25 on SF 1190s requesting reconciliation of expenses (TQSA
      and LQA) and block 26 on all SF 1190 forms are signed by the Army Command partners.

    Answer: The primary contributing factors for the overpayments were a result of
      the Foreign Post Allowance and Differential being applied incorrectly for civilian
      employees. With the additional trainings and reviews, these payments will be
      consistently applied. With better understanding and adherence to established
      payroll procedures, coupled with quality assurance reviews, the Department has
      the ability to prevent these improper payments from continuing to occur.

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: "The primary cause of the Department's Civilian Pay Payment Integrity\
      \ programs technically improper payments is the following contributing factors:\
      \ Signature on document was retroactively dated; supporting documents lacked\
      \ authorizing signatures; certifying signature on supporting document was not\
      \ considered a legal signature; and supporting document's authorization date\
      \ was outside of the date range under review. Furthermore, for the Department\
      \ of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) overseas entitlement program, the DoDEA\
      \ Allowance Processing System (DAPS) uses a physically signed signature card\
      \ which is then uploaded into the application. The system is not able to provide\
      \ a signing official's signature through a digital Common Access Card (CAC)\
      \ signature. There were samples that did not have signatures on the Standard\
      \ Form (SF) 1190s in DAPS due to the transition from DoDEA’s Human Resource\
      \ service providers. DoDEA changed from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to\
      \ the Army Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA). During the service provider\
      \ transition, the signature cards were exchanged between DLA and CHRA which\
      \ produced no signatures on the SF1190s.  \n"

    Answer: During the PIIA Compliance audit work for the Department's Civilian Pay
      Payment Integrity program, the Department Components were unable to provide
      the appropriate Key Supporting Documentation in order to determine if the sample
      was proper or improper. Additionally, Department of Defense Education Activity
      (DoDEA) high-level problems that caused the samples to be marked unknown was
      due to DoDEA’s overseas entitlements. Many of DoDEA’s educators relocate periodically
      to DoDEA schools all over the world resulting in a change in documentation.
      The locality code may be a factor in determining the valid pay code for the
      locality where they are based. The SF1190s that were submitted during testing
      as supporting documentation were not accepted due to the incorrect signatures.

    Answer: 'Internal Controls:

      The Department has internal controls in place that support the reduction of
      improper payments in the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has
      targeted. Moreover, Federal Civilian Pay Services, which support the end-to-end
      delivery of payroll processing services.


      Human Capital:

      The Department has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in
      the Civilian Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      Aside from the planned DoDEA system modernization previously explained as part
      of the planned corrective actions, the Department has the information systems
      and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments in the Civilian
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. The primary system currently
      used by the Department to process Civilian Pay is the Defense Civilian Pay System
      (DCPS). The general and application controls of DCPS were included in the scope
      of the Federal Civilian Pay Services fiscal year (FY) 2023 SSAE No. 18 examination,
      which received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report. Additionally, the Defense
      Civilian Personnel Data System, which provides employment verification information,
      received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023. Moreover,
      the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System, and the
      Deployable Disbursing System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the
      Department, received an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in
      FY 2023. As technology advances, the Department continues to improve the accuracy
      and efficiency of Civilian Pay through implementation of new payroll and entitlement
      processing systems and

      enhancements to existing systems.'

      Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the Payment Integrity

      plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the prior reporting
      year, the

      Department''s Commercial Pay program reported a total of $67.48 million in improper
      plus unknown payments, which is significantly below the statutory threshold.
      Hence, no specific corrective actions were taken for this program.


      The Department pursues continuous training actions for current and new employees
      throughout the Commercial Pay program. Additionally, through trend and root
      cause analysis specific training is provided to prevent improper

      payments for technician error. When the root cause is for other than technician
      error, the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana

    Answer: 'The Department’s Payment Integrity Commercial pay program PIIA objectives
      targets the Commercial Pay vendors who deliver the goods or perform the services

      three-way match between contract, invoice, and goods receipt and

      acceptance. Through internal controls and prepayment authorizations overpayments
      are usually prevented. The Advana improper payment tool is used as prepayment
      resource, which detects possible improper payments which triggers a secondary
      review to confirm whether the proposed payment is proper.

      Certifying Officer Legislation requires a prepayment review attesting the payment
      is legal, proper, and correct. If a loss of funds occurs, the Officer may be
      held liable. Pre-validation is another requirement which ensures funding in
      the amount of the payment is available in the respective accounting system.

    Answer: The Commercial Pay - program's Technically Improper Payments were attributed
      to payments made to vendors not adhering to contractual law and/or regulations.
      One example is a vendor that was inadvertently paid the correct amount and timely;
      however, the invoice and subsequent voucher was processed for a different contract
      modification.

    Answer: 'When a payment cannot be reviewed due to missing or insufficient key
      supporting documentation (KSD), the payment is considered unknown until an accurate
      determination can be made. Occasionally, the KSD is maintained by a different
      Component or section within the Department than the Component who is assigned
      to perform the Payment Integrity review. The Component maintaining the KSD may
      not be able to respond to requests to obtain the substantiating payment-related
      documentation within a predetermined performance timeline for the Payment Integrity
      compliance operational reviews.


      The Department''s Commercial Pay program''s Unknown Payments were transactions
      where the source documentation supporting the payment were not able to be obtained
      prior to the deadlines for the program year. The majority of the unknown payments
      were from two entitlement systems for Government Credit Cards. The payments
      information is electronically transmitted to the entitlement system but the
      original payment documentation to support the payment does not reside in the
      entitlement system. The payment sites have reached out to request the original
      documentation to support the interfaced payments but were not able to access
      the documentation before the end of the reporting year.'

      sessions during DTS testing year, the USAFMCOM Army Financial Services (AFS)
      Director addressed and emphasized the significance of the travel PIIA program,
      the importance of timely and accurate voucher settlement (supported by valid
      documentations), objectives, guidance, assistance and various training available
      to the Army commands.  Each month, the USAFMCOM AFS briefed the commanding general
      and staffs and the Army National Guard and Army Reserves representatives on
      the performance of travel PIIA program, initiatives, requirements and actions
      for accurate, timely and properly documented DTS vouchers.  Training targeting
      the most common causes of improper payments were included in FY2023 training
      to Navy commands (e.g., examples of valid and invalid receipts).  Navy also
      coordinated with DTMO to include better examples of valid and invalid receipts

    Answer: The vast majority of the improper or unknown payments in the DoD Travel
      Pay program are due to the missing or invalid receipt on the travel voucher.
      The root cause of the missing or invalid receipts is the traveler failing to
      submit a proper receipt or the authorizing official approving the travel voucher
      for payment without ensuring a proper receipt is attached. Hence, the improper
      payments are within the agency control as the travelers and authorizing officials

    Answer: DoD travelers, reviewing officials, and approving officials/certifying
      officers were not properly justifying or reviewing DTS claims.  Reviewing and
      approving officials must fully understand the rules and required substantiating
      documents for travel pay entitlements, including the requirements of a proper
      receipt for substantiating travel-related expenses.  The pillars of travel pay
      (the traveler, reviewing official and approving official), particularly the
      reviewing and approving officials, must ensure travelers provide valid documentations
      to support proper reimbursements for the traveler’s expenses incurred in the
      performance of official/business travel missions.  Approving/Certifying Officials
      failing to identify vendor invalid receipts and verifying adherence to Department
      of Defense (DoD) Regulations prior to approving travel expenses exacerbates
      the underlying issues associated with the DoD’s reliance on Travel Pay record-keeping
      systems that are decentralized, heavily interfaced, manually intensive, and
      susceptible to human error.

    Answer: The travelers did not furnish proper documents to substantiate claims
      for the expenses incurred during official travel.  The travelers’ reviewing/approving
      official also overlooked this requirement to support reimbursement upon the
      Defense Travel System (DTS) voucher review and approval process.  The pillars
      of the travel pay program also did not conduct an end-to-end solution and exercise
      internal controls to resolve the absence of valid documentations from travelers
      prior to ensuring the voucher is pay-ready.

    Answer: Lack of understanding official travel requirements is the primary root
      cause of improper payments.  The Department of Defense (DoD) will continue utilizing
      error trend analysis from post pay reviews as to determine areas of focus for
      training.  By targeting additional training for repeat offenders and/or removing
      approval responsibilities, the Department will instill accountability at every
      level of the program.  Due to the Department utilizing year in arrears in the
      Travel Pay program, the effectiveness of actions taken will be determined when
      FY2023 actual travel payment results are measured.  For invalid receipts, the
      policy change to permit use of other corroborating documentation only resolves
      issues with receipts that do not meet the DoD's definition.  For instances where
      the traveler provides documentation that is other than a receipt (e.g., hotel
      reservation, flight itinerary, or rental car pickup slip), awareness training
      and command accountability will continue to be focus areas.  Resources, guidance,
      support, training, and communication are continuous.  Payment Integrity personnel
      provide commands detailed information, data, and recommendations to reduce improper
      payments and unknown payments.  The DoD Travel Pay program's performance metrics
      and solutions are discussed, explained, and tracked for resolutions.  Effective
      management and oversight will ensure reviewing officials and approving officials
      comply with regulatory guidance and conduct duties to standard that would ensure
      timely and accurate (with valid supporting documentations) DTS voucher disbursements.

    Answer: The cause of the Military Pay - Army program's Technically Improper payments
      are missing certifying signature on the key supporting documentation for the
      entitlement. An additional problem set that contributed to the Military Pay
      - Army program's Technically Improper payments is the reconstruction of the
      original order that authorized the entitlements for the payment was inadvertently
      destroyed.  When this occurs, the Army takes the appropriate steps based off
      of the Army regulations to correct the Soldier's pay record. The date of the
      corrected order/digital signatures may be after the effective date for the sample
      at the time of payment.

    Answer: The Military Pay- Army program scenarios are broad and complex based upon
      the requirements to authorize an entitlement or deduction. For example, an unknown
      sample covering military pay and allowances, which could be for multiple reasons.
      Military Pay - Army payments are identified as unknown due to appropriate/applicable
      key supporting documents (KSDs) not readily available to be reviewed.  The KSDs
      were not in the designated repositories. The Army will continue to research
      the appropriate repositories to obtain the applicable KSDs to resolve these
      errors. The primary repositories are iPERMS and CEDMS.

    Answer: 'Internal Controls:

      The Army has internal controls in place that support the reduction of improper
      payments in its Military Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted.
      Moreover, Military Pay Services, which support the end-to-end delivery of payroll
      processing services, received an unmodified System and Organizational

      Control (SOC) 1 Type 2 report under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements
      (SSAE) No. 18 in fiscal year (FY) 2023.


      Human Capital:

      The Army has the human capital it needs to reduce improper payments in the Military
      Pay program to the levels the Department has targeted. As the Army’s Military
      Pay program evolves and DoD operations change, additional skill sets, and personnel
      resources may be needed to sustain and advance the program.

      However, implementing the new strategy for achieving compliance will necessitate
      a considerable increase in payment sampling which will require additional human
      capital working hours to implement and possible a reorganizational posture to
      bring the programs into Phase 1 Risk Assessment cycle.


      Information Systems and Other Infrastructure:

      The Army has the information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce
      improper payments in the Military Pay program to the levels the Department has
      targeted. However, as technology advances, the Army and the Department continue
      to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Military Pay through implementation
      of new integrated pay and personnel processing systems. The Army continues to
      make progress towards fully implementing the Integrated Pay and Personnel System
      – Army (IPPS-A) in the future. Under IPPS-A, improper payments will be reduced
      because entitlements will be directly inputted into the Military Pay payroll
      system by an authorized personnel source thereby eliminating all manual processing.
      Moreover, the Automated Disbursing System, the Centralized Disbursing System,
      and the Deployable Disbursing

      System, which are the primary disbursing systems for the Department, received
      an unmodified SOC 1 Type 2 report under SSAE No. 18 in FY 2023.'

    Answer: The majority of overpayments within agency control are due to calculation
      errors, data entry errors, or incorrect processing. Elimination of human error
      altogether is unrealistic. However, closer attention to details could prevent
      certain errors. Reduction in human errors would prevent and reduce overall improper
      payments. Furthermore, the corrective actions employed by the Defense Finance
      and Accounting Service Military Retirement Operations team in Fiscal Year (FY)
      2023 significantly reduced monetary loss errors resulted in the program's removal
      from the previous OMB High Priority program status going into FY 2024.

  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: For the Department's Military Retirement Payment Integrity program, the
      Retired and Annuitant (R&A) Operations Team has no control over when they receive
      notification of a member’s death. There are controls in place to try to prevent
      paying deceased members including monthly SSA death match. It is still nearly
      impossible to prevent every payment to a deceased member due to timing of death
      and method of notification. Significant progress in lowering Monetary Loss outside
      of the Agency control was realized in FY 2023 through the corrective actions
      employed and the partnership with the Veterans Affairs Administration. In FY
      2022, there was a projected Monetary Loss outside of the Agency control of $318.10
      million; however, in FY 2023 that amount was reduced down to $264 thousand.

      In both cases, the errors were attributable to not having complete retirement

      required documentation from the payee, while the other account required documentation
      from the Branch of Service. In both cases, the Military Retirement Operations

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: TEXT
  - Agency: DOD
    Answer: The Department's Military Retirement program program has significantly
      decreased Improper (IP) and Unknown payments (UP). The combined projected IP
      and UP amounts in Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 was $418.83 Million and decreased to
      $146.36 Million in FY 2023. Specifically, the greatest reduction was realized
      in Monetary loss (both inside and outside the Agency control designation). In
      FY 2022, there was a combined $318.10 Million in monetary losses, which was
      reduced to $75.49 Million in FY 2023. The reduction of IP and UP is a clear
      indication of more than adequate corrective actions taken coupled with successfully
      removing the Military Retirement program from the OMB High Priority list going
      into FY 2024. Furthermore, the Department, through deliberate synchronized efforts
      with the subject matter experts within the DFAS Military Retirement Operations,
      have strategically crafted additional corrective actions that are highly anticipated
      to continue to reduce IP and UP to the tolerable levels underneath the OMB statutory
      threshold in FY 2024. Once the corrective actions are fully implemented mainly
      the increase in data integrity both in scope and timeliness, continued evolvement
      and enhancement of systems coupled with the strategic mission area realignment,
      the Department is confident that the Military Retirement portfolio will achieve
      PIIA Compliance during the FY 2024 audit.
