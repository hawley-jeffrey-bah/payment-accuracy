    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding automation include continuing
      to implement new software that will provide a customized and enhanced tool to
      streamline claims, automate eligibility determinations, payment processing,
      detection and prevention of improper payments, and enhance reporting and auditing
      capabilities. Additionally, VA will continue with the post-implementation modernization
      of the beneficiary travel claims processing software and other systems. In addition,
      VA will continue planning for the Electronic Claims Adjudication Management
      System for invoice payment processing nationwide, which is expected to improve
      the timeliness and accuracy of ambulance claims processing. These actions are
      designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes
      and human error.

      Beneficiary Travel program office will submit proposed enterprise-wide infrastructure
      solutions to address staffing requirements, training, standardized business
      processes, program-level monitoring, and quality assurance reporting. These
      actions are designed to reduce improper and unknown payments errors associated
      with failure to access data/information needed to ensure proper payment amounts.  Change
      process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal
      controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding
      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    Needs2: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore,
      VA has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal
      controls to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: 'The Beneficiary Travel program continues to prioritize and implement
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper
      and unknown payments as evidenced by its sixth consecutive year of rate reductions.
      In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented
      in FY 2022. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Beneficiary
      Travel program indicated that of the four actions assessed, three were open
      and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one
      was open and determined that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate
      the root cause. If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis
      to refine the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce
      root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $81.31 million in FY 2021 to $58.95 million in FY 2022,
      or a 28% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or
      improper, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed
      to a reduction in the unknown payment amount from $36.73 million in FY 2021
      to $24.04 million in FY 2022, or a 35% reduction. For errors tied to statutory
      requirements of program not met, associated corrective actions or mitigation
      strategies did not reduce the improper payment amount from FY 2021 to FY 2022.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.'

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate the closest facility
      that could provide the Veteran's treatment was utilized, special mode transportation
      rates were correctly paid according to contract, if applicable, services were
      received, beneficiary met administrative and medical qualification, or claim
      payments were calculated according to mileage and deductibles, if applicable.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving processes and controls surrounding administrative and medical qualifications,
      and simplifying contract pricing, when applicable, to include valid claim mileage
      calculations. Additionally, system improvements will allow for automation of
      the authorizations and will ensure services are rendered, decreasing human error.
      These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Subheading: Technically Improper Payments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was paid
      to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet all regulatory
      and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the
      right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper approval on medical qualification.
      Specifically, where clinical documentation for special mode travel was not properly
      and timely approved by a VA clinician, or a request was not sent to procurement
      to create a contract modification. These resulted in technically improper payments
      for failing to comply with 38 Code of Federal Regulations - Applications (Part
      70.20), 38 Code of Federal Regulations - Criteria for approval (Part 70.4),
      and Federal Acquisition Regulation sections General (Part 1.601)  and Policy
      (Part 43.102).

    Subheading: Unknown Payments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation related to authorization, receiving, or eligibility documentation
      that was required to validate whether a payment was proper or improper. Specifically,
      these unknown payments occur when the agency was unable to determine the Veteran's
      eligibility due to missing annual income documentation, the special mode transportation
      was not medically necessary or approved by a VA clinician before transportation
      occurred, and the stations did not provide proof of receipt. Without annual
      income eligibility, receiving supporting documentation and special mode transportation
      or common carrier preauthorization and/or proof of care, if applicable, the
      program is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

    Subheading: Unknown Due to Insufficient or Lack of Documentation from the Applicants
    Type: MILLIONS_OF_DOLLARS
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA is required to validate an applicant's eligibility documentation such
      as income or interfacility (transfer between VA facilities) verification. VA
      uses projected gross household income and deductible expenses to validate that
      the applicant is eligible based on income. VA uses the non-VA care authorizations
      and medical records to verify eligibility to transfer between VA facilities.
      When review of the payments reveals that the station failed to obtain the eligibility
      documentation, the payment is considered an unknown payment because the reviewer
      is unable to discern whether the payment was a proper payment or an improper
      payment.

      Scenario
    Type: MILLIONS_OF_DOLLARS
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA is required to validate authorization of transport and care. However,
      the agency currently does not have the documentation necessary to determine
      if the payment is proper or not. Local VA Medical Centers failed to provide
      authorization and receiving documentation. Specifically, authorization documentation
      such as the non-VA care authorization or special mode travel or emergent ambulance
      document was not obtained. The missing documentation needed will assist VA in
      determining the clinical need for transport. Centralized documentation retention
      for each claim is not currently possible within the agency’s current systems
      of record environment. Hard copy evidence can be maintained at local VA Medical
      Centers responsible for claims processing. For this reason, we are unable to
      conclude whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without
      that documentation.

      that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally, VA will ensure
      ordering processes are compliant with statute and regulation, thus reducing
      technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments. These actions
      are designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure
      to access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation

    Answer: 'While VA confirmed the payment was paid to the right person in the right
      amount, all laws and regulations were not followed.  Specifically, either the
      order was placed by an unauthorized individual, the contract was missing the
      proper signature, or the purchase was made without a contract. This resulted
      in technically improper payments for failing to comply with VA Acquisition Regulations

    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation related to invoice pricing that was required to validate whether
      a payment was proper or not. Specifically, the agency was unable to determine
      the appropriate pricing due to the lack information in the contract price schedule.

    Answer: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
      contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
      includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
      price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
      vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether or not the
      billed amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice
      of $1,000 for lease of facility A; however, the contract price schedule is $3,000
      for "rent" and does not specifically include a line item or rate for the billed
      lease of facility A.  For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether the
      payment is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional cost
      details in the contract price schedule.

    Needs1: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding
      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    Needs2: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore,
      VA has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal
      controls to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: 'The Medical Care Contracts and Agreements program continues to prioritize
      and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce
      improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its second consecutive year of
      reductions. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Medical Care Contracts
      and Agreements program decreased its improper and unknown error rate from 7.47%
      to 3.95% (3.52% reduction) and improper and unknown payments from $78.49 million
      to $45.72 million ($32.77 million reduction). In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness
      review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2022.  The purpose of
      this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions or mitigation
      strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized
      within the agency. The results for the Medical Care Contracts and Agreements
      program indicated that of the four actions assessed, one was closed and determined
      to be effective in mitigating the root cause, and three were open and determined
      to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause. If improvements could be
      made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
      strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $11.69 million in FY 2021 to $5.34 million in FY 2022, or
      a 54% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or improper,
      associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total
      reduction in the unknown payment amount from $128.16 million in FY 2021 to $50.94
      million in FY 2022, or a 60% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements
      of program not met, associated corrective actions contributed did not result
      in a reduction from FY 2021 to FY 2022.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.'

    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed. Specifically, overpayments occur
      when VA did not pay the correct dollar amount according to the contract. The
      agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by improving
      controls in the payment processes and simplifying contract pricing. Medical
      Care Contracts and Agreements is able to validate the correct payment to be
      made per the invoice or contract prior to issuing payment. These improvements
      will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Answer: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was
      paid to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet
      all regulatory and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment
      was paid to the right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper delegation
      for the order placed. Specifically, the ordering officer placed a funded order;
      however, the required written delegation was not in place at the time of the
      order. This resulted in technically improper payments for failing to comply
      with VA Acquisition Regulations sections: Career Development, Contracting Authority,
      and Responsibilities/General (Part 801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering
      Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering Officers

    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation to validate the appropriate contract pricing, lack of payment
      documentation, or lack of documentation related to invoice submittal requirements.
      Specifically, the agency was unable to determine the appropriate pricing due
      to the lack of information in the contract price schedule, or insufficient information
      on the invoice to be able to determine the appropriate amount billed and paid.
      In addition, the agency was unable to determine if the required invoice submittal
      documentation was obtained per the contract. Without documentation supporting
      the appropriate information per the contract or per the invoice, the program
      is unable to determine whether the amount paid is proper or improper.

    Answer: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
      contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
      includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
      price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
      vendor's invoice. The missing documentation is related to whether or not the
      billed amount on the invoice is accurate. For example, VA receives an invoice
      of $10 for a complete blood test lab service but the contract price schedule
      only indicates a total cost of $300 for all blood lab services. In this scenario,
      the contract price does not contain sufficient detail to confirm the cost of
      a complete blood test is $10. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether
      the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional
      cost details in the contract price schedule.

      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    Needs2: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore,
      VA has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal
      controls to reduce improper and unknown payments to the tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: The Pension program continues to prioritize and implement effective
      corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper payments.
      In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of actions developed and implemented
      in FY 2022. The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness of
      corrective actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were effectively
      implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the Pension program
      indicated that of the four actions assessed, one was closed and determined to
      be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to be
      correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and two were open and determined
      that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements
      could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program's mitigation
      strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error. For errors
      tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective actions or
      mitigation strategies contributed to a reduction in the improper payment amount
      from $472.99 million in FY 2022 to $362.34 million in FY 2023, or a 23% reduction.
      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.

    Answer: 'VA overpayments are within the agency’s control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to correctly process beneficiary
      awards. These overpayments occurred for multiple reasons; however, the two main
      reasons are: (1) that beneficiaries failed to notify VA of changes and (2) human
      error. Claims processors can manually access Social Security Administration
      income information to calculate correct benefit amounts when a beneficiary notifies
      VA of a change. VA is improving administrative compliance by using the Social
      Security Administration income match. The program is also working with claims
      processing stations on the individual errors identified each fiscal year. These
      improvements will result in increased payment accuracy.'

    Answer: "VA overpayments outside the agency’s control occur when the program is\
      \ either unable to access information which is needed or the information needed\
      \ does not exist to validate payment accuracy prior to payment due to regulatory\
      \ barriers. Specifically, overpayments occur when Social Security benefits are\
      \ increased as the result of a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, the\
      \ Pension maximum annual rates are increased by a like percentage at the same\
      \ time (per Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief\
      \ (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part\
      \ Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart\
      \ A), Improved Pension Rates (3.23). The effective date of Social Security Administration\
      \ and Pension cost-of-living adjustments is December 1; which are paid January\
      \ 1. Pension is unable to prevent these overpayments from occurring because\
      \ VA is unable to access the ‘post cost-of-living adjustment’ Social Security\
      \ Administration income amount data at the time in which VA makes its cost-of-living\
      \ adjustment changes in December for the January Pension payments. The cost\
      \ of establishing additional cross data sharing with the Social Security Administration\
      \ has been explored and the cost of internal and external IT information technology\
      \ infrastructure and strategic changes are not cost effective.\n\nCode of Federal\
      \ Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief (Title 38), Department\
      \ of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One), Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation,\
      \ and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (Subpart A), Elections of Pension\
      \ or Compensation (3.701) requires VA to pay a beneficiary who has dual entitlements\
      \ (Pension and Compensation) the higher of the two amounts; unless a beneficiary\
      \ specifically elects one over the other. \n\nOverpayments can also occur when\
      \ beneficiaries, as allowed by the Code of Federal Regulations: Pensions, Bonuses,\
      \ and Veterans' Relief (Title 38), Department of Veterans Affairs (Chapter One),\
      \ Adjudications (Part Three), Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity\
      \ Compensation (Subpart A), Computation of Income (3.271), provide revised medical\
      \ expenses to VA after payments are made. VA is unable to prevent these overpayments\
      \ from occurring because regulations require VA to make applicable retroactive\
      \ adjustments based upon the revised medical expenses for which beneficiaries\
      \ are the sole source of information. In addition, overpayments occur if Prisoner\
      \ status information is not timely received, resulting in overpayments. VA is\
      \ unable to prevent these overpayments from occurring because VA relies on sources\

    Description_Action_Taken: Actions planned regarding change process include working
      to ensure invoices are being validated per the contract pricing prior to payment.
      VA will also implement short and long-term contracting options for Community
      Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements. In
      addition, VA will enforce contract requirements for third party administrators
      to bill at the correct allowable rates. These actions are designed to address
      overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to access data/information,
      technically improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of program
      not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether
      proper or improper. Change process was the best mitigation strategy in order
      to develop stronger internal controls and mitigate risks within existing payment
      processes.

      System is needed to ensure Homemaker/Home Health Aide Service, Community Nursing
      Home, and Veteran Directed Care claims are paid appropriately. VA will then
      develop an effective corrective action for implementation. These actions are
      designed to address overpayments and underpayments attributed to failure to
      access data/information, technically improper payments attributed to statutory
      requirements of program not met, and unknown payments attributed to being unable
      to determine whether proper or improper. Automation was the best mitigation
      strategy because improper and unknown payments resulted from manual processes
      and human error.

      correct rate. These actions were taken to address overpayments and underpayments
      attributed to failure to access data/information. Although the overall corrective
      actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY 2023 for actions addressing
      underpayments, tasks within the actions were completed to move the overall action
      implementation forward.

      issues, and should no longer occur with the implementation of the MISSION Act.
      Additionally, VA simplified the documentation request process and utilized tools
      that targeted missing documentation. These actions were taken to address technically
      improper payments attributed to statutory requirements of the program not met
      and unknown payments attributed to being unable to determine whether proper
      or improper.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding
      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    Needs2: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore,
      VA has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal
      controls to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: 'The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program continues
      to prioritize and implement effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies
      that reduce improper and unknown payments as evidenced by its third consecutive
      year of rate reductions. Specifically, from FY 2022 to FY 2023, the Purchased
      Long Term Services and Supports program decreased its improper and unknown error
      rate from 47.45% to 38.72% (8.73% reduction). In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness
      review of the actions developed and implemented in FY 2022.  The purpose of
      this review was to assess the appropriateness of corrective actions and mitigation
      strategies and whether the actions were effectively implemented and prioritized
      within the agency. The results for the Purchased Long Term Services and Supports
      program indicated that of the five actions assessed, three were closed and determined
      to be effective in mitigating the root cause, one was open and determined to
      be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause, and one was open and determined
      that improvements could be made to effectively mitigate the root cause. If improvements
      could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine the program''s mitigation
      strategies to ensure they address and reduce root cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $110.01 million in FY 2021 to $62.10 million in FY 2022,
      or a 44% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not
      met, associated corrective actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a
      total reduction in the improper payment amount from $1,308.24 million in FY
      2021 to $1,048.38 million in FY 2022, or a 20% reduction. For errors tied to
      unable to determine whether proper or improper, associated corrective actions
      or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the unknown payment
      amount from $477.02 million in FY 2021 to $175.01 million in FY 2022, or a 63%
      reduction.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.'

    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to validate payment was made in
      accordance with the contract rate, a valid agreement was in place and/or the
      provider is eligible per the contract or agreement covering the billed dates
      of service, billed services did not exceed the authorized care and were eligible
      per regulatory or contractual requirements, and payment is made in the appropriate
      amount and/or is paid the lesser of billed charges or local VA fee schedule.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving controls in the payment processes, implementing system enhancements
      to include a prepayment check, and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorization review, decreasing
      human error. These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Answer: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was
      paid to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet
      all regulatory and/or statutory requirements. Specifically, VA placed contract
      orders for Community Nursing Home care without the proper authority in place
      and/or was unable to obtain written documentation to support the ordering officer
      delegation. Additionally, a valid contract or provider agreement was not in
      place when required for Community Nursing Home care. These resulted in technically
      improper payments for failing to comply with VA Acquisition Regulations sections:
      Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities/General (Part
      801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery

      dates of service. Without documentation supporting the valid rate to calculate
      the appropriate reimbursement amount, the program is unable to determine whether

    Answer: VA is required to validate the appropriate reimbursement rate per the
      contract or agreement. However, the agency currently does not have the documentation
      necessary to determine if the payment is proper or not. Specifically, VA is
      not always able to price home hospice care. This occurs when the provider status
      is not current with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the dates
      of service to validate the appropriate pricing. The missing documentation needed
      will assist VA in determining whether or not the billed amount on the claim
      or the paid amount is accurate. For this reason, we are unable to conclude whether
      the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without that documentation.

      attributed to failure to access data/information, technically improper payments
      were attributed to statutory requirements of program not met, and unknown payments
      attributed to being unable to determine whether proper or improper.  Change
      process was the best mitigation strategy in order to develop stronger internal
      controls and mitigate risks within existing payment processes.

      existing local and national contracts, required secondary level of approval
      on invoices by contract specialists prior to payment, implemented ordering systems,
      and rejected invoices that do not comply with contract requirements. Additionally,
      VA ensured ordering processes were compliant with statute and regulation, thus
      reducing technically improper payments caused by unauthorized commitments. Although
      the overall corrective actions were not fully implemented/completed during FY
      2023 for actions addressing improper and unknown payments, tasks within the
      actions were completed to move the overall action implementation forward.
    Mitigation_Strategy: atp4_1
  ActionsTakenAdditionalData:
    Needs1: 'VA has not determined a tolerable rate due to all requirements for establishing
      a tolerable rate not yet being met. In March 2023, GAO acknowledged VA’s substantial
      reduction in improper and unknown payments using effective mitigation strategies
      and corrective actions (GAO-23-106285, IMPROPER PAYMENTS: Fiscal Year 2022 Estimates
      and Opportunities for Improvement). VA continues to prioritize implementing
      appropriate corrective actions and mitigation strategies and has adequate funding
      to implement improvements planned to internal controls, human capital, information
      systems and other infrastructure, as needed, over VA’s payment processing and
      procurement systems to continue reducing improper and unknown payments. VA will
      establish a tolerable rate if all applicable requirements are met.'
    Needs2: At this time, VA is not aware of additional program needs. Therefore,
      VA has not requested additional resources to establish and maintain internal
      controls to reduce improper and unknown payments to a tolerable rate.
    Sufficiency: 'The Supplies and Materials program continues to prioritize and implement
      effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies that reduce improper
      and unknown payments as evidenced by its fifth consecutive year of reductions.
      In FY 2023, VA performed an effectiveness review of the actions developed and
      implemented in FY 2022.  The purpose of this review was to assess the appropriateness
      of corrective actions or mitigation strategies and whether the actions were
      effectively implemented and prioritized within the agency. The results for the
      Supplies and Materials program indicated that of the two actions assessed, two
      were open and determined to be correctly designed to mitigate the root cause.
      If improvements could be made, VA conducted a root cause analysis to refine
      the program''s mitigation strategies to ensure they address and reduce root
      cause(s) of error.


      For errors tied to failure to access data/information, associated corrective
      actions or mitigation strategies contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $16.52 million in FY 2021 to $2.04 million in FY 2022, or
      an 88% reduction. For errors tied to statutory requirements of program not met,
      associated corrective actions contributed to a total reduction in the improper
      payment amount from $144.21 million in FY 2021 to $129.76 million in FY 2022,
      or a 10% reduction. For errors tied to unable to determine whether proper or
      improper, associated corrective actions contributed to a total reduction in
      the unknown payment amount from $56.22 million in FY 2021 to $0.22 million in
      FY 2022, or a 99.61% reduction.


      VA will perform an effectiveness review in FY 2024 of the corrective action
      plans developed and implemented in FY 2023 due to the time needed to develop
      and implement actions as well as to impact the payment process. Results of this
      review will be reported in FY 2024.'

      in accordance with the contract rate or to validate goods billed on invoices
      were received prior to issuing payment. The agency has the direct ability to

    Answer: 'VA payments are considered technically improper when the payment was
      paid to the right person in the right amount but the payment failed to meet
      all regulatory and/or statutory requirements. While VA confirmed the payment
      was paid to the right person in the right amount, VA lacked proper delegation
      for the order placed. Specifically, the ordering officer placed a funded order;
      however; the required written delegation was not in place at the time of the
      order. These resulted in technically improper payments for failing to comply
      with VA Acquisition Regulations sections: Career Development, Contracting Authority,
      and Responsibilities/General (Part 801.601), Federal Supply Schedules/Ordering
      Officers (Part 808.470), and Indefinite-Delivery Contracts/Ordering Officers

    Answer: VA is required to validate invoice amounts are in accordance with the
      contract rate prior to issuing payment. Despite having a contract in place that
      includes a price schedule, the invoice price cannot be reconciled to the contract
      price schedule due to lack of detail in the contract price schedule and/or the
      vendor's invoice. For example, VA receives an invoice of $10 for one pair of
      surgical scissors; however, the contract price schedule is $30 for "surgical
      supplies" and does not specifically include a line item and rate for the billed
      pair of surgical scissors. For this reason, VA is unable to conclude whether
      the payment is proper or improper at time of payment without the additional
      cost details in the contract price schedule.

    Subheading: Overpayments
    Type: PERCENTAGE
  - Agency: VA
    Answer: VA overpayments are within the agency's control and occur when the program
      failed to access the data/information needed to determine that a valid agreement
      was in place and/or that the provider is eligible per the contract or agreement
      covering the billed dates of services prior to issuing payment. VA is also required
      to validate that payment was made in accordance with the contract rate, billed
      services did not exceed the authorized care and were eligible per regulatory
      or contractual requirements prior to issuing payment, and that payment is made
      in the appropriate amount per regulation. For contract related instances, the
      Community Care Network contractors are also responsible for ensuring the VA
      is invoiced in accordance with the contract pricing and payment guidelines.
      The agency has the direct ability to prevent overpayments from occurring by
      improving controls in the payment processes, implementing system enhancements
      to include a prepayment check, and simplifying contract pricing. Additionally,
      system improvements will allow for automation of the authorization review, decreasing
      human error. These improvements will allow for more accurate payment validation.

    Answer: The payments are considered unknown payments when VA had lacking or insufficient
      documentation to validate pricing. Specifically, VA was unable to determine
      the appropriate pricing due to the lack of other health insurance documentation.
      Without documentation supporting the other health insurance information for
      specific non-contract related payments, the program is unable to determine whether
      the amount paid is proper or improper.

    Answer: VA is required to validate the appropriate reimbursement rate per the
      other health insurance information for non-contract related payments. However,
      the agency currently does not have the documentation necessary to determine
      if the payment is proper or not. Specifically, VA is not able to determine the
      correct rate without the required explanation of benefits. When the explanation
      of benefits is not available, the claim should be returned to the provider.
      The missing documentation needed will assist VA in determining whether or not
      the reimbursement amount per VA regulation is correct. For this reason, we are
      unable to conclude whether the payment is proper or improper at time of payment
      without that documentation.
