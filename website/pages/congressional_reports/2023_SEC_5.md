- Answer: 'The benefits of recaptured amounts associated with implementing and overseeing
    the program do not exceed the costs— including staff time and payments to contractors—of
    a payment recapture audit program.  In making this determination, the SEC considered
    its low improper payment rate based on

    testing conducted over several years. The SEC also considered whether sophisticated
    software and other cost-efficient techniques could be used to identify significant
    overpayments at a low cost per overpayment, or if labor intensive manual reviews
    of paper documentation would be required.  In addition, the SEC considered the
    availability of tools to efficiently perform the payment recapture audit and minimize
    payment recapture audit costs.


    The SEC will continue to monitor its improper payments across all programs and
    activities it administers and assess whether implementing payment recapture audits
    for each program is cost-effective.'
