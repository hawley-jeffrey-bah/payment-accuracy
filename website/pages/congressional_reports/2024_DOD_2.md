SurveyData:
- Answer: The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program
    is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department of Defense
    (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously demonstrating
    financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a
    combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components,
    PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries performed by TRICARE private sector contractors.
    The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken by DoD Components
    with additional collection activities performed by the Defense Finance and Accounting
    Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.
