    Answer: The U.S. Army Civilian Human Resource Agency directed civilian pay personnel
      offices to ensure that all Standard Form (SF) 1190s are signed by their Command
      partners. The reason this is still causing technically improper payments is
      that the employee’s current three to five year tour includes prior year SF1190s
      that are not being properly signed.

    Answer: "During the FY 2023 and FY 2024 Payment Integrity Audits, it was found\
      \ that DoDEA did not have proper signatures on both the Standard Form (SF) 1190\
      \ and the Department of Defense (DD) Form 1614.  \n\nIn the DoDEA Allowance\
      \ Processing System (DAPS) (SF1190) and the Travel Order Processing System (TOPS)(DD1614),\
      \ a DoDEA employee must complete an SF1190 to apply for authorization and payment\
      \ for overseas allowances.  The DoDEA employee must also complete an DD-1614\
      \ to apply for Non-TDY Travel. \nCompletion of the SF-1190 and the DD-1614 provides\
      \ the necessary information to determine the correct amount for all overseas\
      \ and travel allowances.  DAPS and TOPS are older systems that do not have the\
      \ ability to provide Common Access Card (CAC) signatures.  However, DAPS and\
      \ TOPS are DoDEA systems that have official signature cards on file and can\
      \ only be accessed with appropriate vetted access and a CAC.  It is important\
      \ to note that DoDEA employees are being paid correctly and this is just a supporting\
      \ documentation control finding.\n\nDAPS and TOPS are to be modernized in the\
      \ coming years and will provide the capability to have CAC signatures on the\
      \ SF1190 and DD1614.\n"

    Answer: 'The Department’s unknown payments within the Civilian Pay Other Defense
      Organization were primarily a result of the lack of sufficient key supporting
      documentation (KSD) to substantiate whether payments were proper or improper
      at the time of post-payment reviews. Specifically, with payments related to
      the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) under the Defense Health Agency (DHA),
      the Department was undergoing a consolidation of components at the DHA and the
      Civilian Humans Resources Agency (CHRA) level. During the transition, certain
      individuals (and their roles) were reshuffled and re-purposed. This meant that
      the responsibility of retaining and subsequently providing supporting documentation,
      such as those necessary for post-pay review and analysis of improper and unknown
      payments had fallen to new personnel during FY 2024 who were unfamiliar with
      the procedure and process of procuring and providing supporting documentation.
      As a result, the effort involved in accessing the proper points of contact became
      arduous and the DHA was unable to do so in a timely enough fashion to obtain,
      review, and ultimately provide KSD to substantiate payments. Examples of the
      missing KSDs are travel orders, Foreign Allowances Application, Grant and Report
      (SF-1190), and Standard Form 50 (SF-50) Notification of Personnel Action to
      validate alimony garnishments, child support garnishments, market pay validation,
      location information, living quarters allowance (LQA).


      In FY 2025 DHA-MTF will evaluate and develop new processes to ensure the auditors
      and/or DFAS reviewers receive the correct key supporting documentation for the
      samples in a timely manner based off of the deliverable schedule.'

    Answer: 'The Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program does not have a formal
      corrective action plan to maintain or improve based on current year findings.
      Specifically, corrective action plans are required under the Payment Integrity
      Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) when a program''s total annual improper payments
      plus unknown payments exceed the statutory threshold. In the current reporting
      year, the Department''s Commercial Pay MOCAS program reported an estimated total
      of $96.29 million of improper plus unknown payments, which is only 0.04 percent
      of the total outlays. Hence, no specific corrective actions were taken for this
      program. The Department pursues continuous training actions for current and
      new employees throughout the Commercial Pay MOCAS program. Additionally, through
      trend and root cause analysis, specific training is provided to prevent improper
      payments from technician error. For root causes other than technician error,
      the issue is addressed with the applicable party at fault (i.e., contracting
      personal, receiving entities and systemic controls to name a few. The Advana
      detection tool is continually monitored and evaluated to rank and rate proposed
      integrity checks to identify and prevent improper payments in the pre-payment
      environment.

    Answer: The United States Army National Guard (ARNG) Financial Services will continue
      to host virtual trainings to the 50 States, Territories and the District of
      Columbia. The ARNG, in conjunction with the United States Army Reserve, will
      start a Military pay certification program in Q2 of FY2025 to provide baseline
      Military pay training to new state pay technicians. These trainings will be
      offered quarterly to maintain pay proficiency across the 50 States, Territories
      and the District of Columbia (in addition to the virtual monthly trainings that
      are already provided).

    Answer: 'The Army Defense Travel System (DTS) statutory improper payments were
      attributed to Army travelers who failed to provide receipts or provided invalid
      receipts for authorized expenses (e.g., airfare, rental vehicle and lodging)
      while on temporary duty. However, the DTS approving officials/certifying officers
      approved these DTS vouchers as pay-ready for reimbursement when the vouchers
      lacked proper documentation in accordance with the Department of Defense Financial
      Management Regulation, Volume 9, "Travel Policy."


      In Review Year 2025, the Army will continue to conduct collaborative training
      sessions every other month with the Army Command''s Lead Defense Travel Administrator
      and senior travel management leaders to emphasize the objectives and requirements
      of the Payment Integrity Information Act program, strengthen internal controls
      and to mitigate submitting, reviewing and approving non-compliant DTS vouchers.'

    Answer: The bot described previously will continue to run every two weeks until
      the proper internal controls are addressed in the Defense Travel System (DTS)
      by DTMO to prevent wrongful granting of DTS permission levels. Additionally,
      the DTS system has the technology today to identify improper payments through
      their Compliance Tool (CT), but only applies this technology post-payment.

    Answer: The behavioral/psych influence corrective actions described in previously
      are continuous.  They began during FY24 and will continue on a monthly basis
      as long as there are DAF approving officials approving improper payments within
      DTS.

    Answer: 'The training corrective actions as described previously are continuous.
      They will continue on a monthly basis as long as there are DAF approving officials
      approving improper payments within Defense Travel System (DTS).  In addition
      to these, the DAF is implementing a quarterly training for component and installation
      level travel pay teams, to help them better train and assist their travelers,
      approving officials, and reviewing officials.

      The root cause for invalid receipts being submitted for travel related payments
      includes the following:

      Travel related payments are processed in DTS with invalid or missing receipts,
      and missing information needed to properly substantiate the travel payment.

      The monthly and quarterly training will address the invalid or missing receipts
      as well as the missing information needed to properly substantiate the travel
      payment.

SurveyData:
- Answer: The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program
    is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department of Defense
    (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously demonstrating
    financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a
    combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components,
    PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries performed by TRICARE private sector contractors.
    The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken by DoD Components
    with additional collection activities performed by the Defense Finance and Accounting
    Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.
