- Answer: "With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each\
    \ state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining\
    \ UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment,\
    \ and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments\
    \ for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of\
    \ New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity\
    \ Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases\
    \ such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such\
    \ as tips and leads.\n\nState UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states\
    \ are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing\
    \ recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection\
    \ and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments\
    \ established and recovered.\n\nStates are required to hold claimants liable to\
    \ repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to recover improper\
    \ payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds\
    \ and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must\
    \ be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities.  States\
    \ may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity\
    \ and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery\
    \ of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\
    \ Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment\
    \ Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances\
    \ may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.\n\nETA issued\
    \ UIPL No. 23-20 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity\
    \ functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment\
    \ compensation (UC) programs and consolidated, clarified, and expanded these activities\
    \ with the issuance of UIPL No. 11-23.   ETA requires states to use the overpayment\
    \ recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to\
    \ require such actions):\n•\tBenefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle\
    \ Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5\
    \ of UIPL No. 13- 20, Change 2);\n•\tTreasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable\
    \ covered debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);\n\
    •\tCross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and\n•\t\
    Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).\n\n\
    ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery\
    \ activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment\
    \ recovery operation:\n•\tNegotiating repayment plans;\n•\tAccepting repayments\
    \ through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);\n•\tState Income\
    \ Tax Offset Program;\n•\tWage garnishments;\n•\tProperty liens and assessments;\n\
    •\tOffsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;\n•\t\
    Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual\
    \ with an outstanding overpayment;\n•\tSkip tracing;\n•\tWork proactively and\
    \ collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity,\
    \ ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL\
    \ No. 19-21);\n•\tCivil actions;\n•\tCredit bureau referrals;\n•\tState/federal\
    \ prosecution;\n•\tPenalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state\
    \ and federal law; \n•\tCollection agency referrals when state staff is limited,\
    \ or debt is uncollectable by other means; \n•\tImplementing a voluntary fraud\
    \ self-disclosure program; and \n•\tOther recovery methods as determined by state\
    \ law or policy."
