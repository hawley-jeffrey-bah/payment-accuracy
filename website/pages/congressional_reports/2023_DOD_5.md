SurveyData:
- Answer: The DoD Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program is the Department’s overall
    plan for risk analysis and the performance of payment recovery audits. PRAs are
    reviews and analyses of program accounting and financial records, supporting documentation,
    and other pertinent information supporting its payments; and it is designed specifically,
    to identify overpayments. It is through this system of internal controls surrounding
    the payments that assists in resolving the erroneous non-intentional monetary
    loss of Department dollars. The Department also utilizes collaborative working
    groups and enhanced specific reports that are disseminated to the responsible
    DoD Component for the identification, validation, and potential corrective actions
    for the trends of overpayment types, if necessary.

- Answer: The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program
    is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department of Defense
    (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously demonstrating
    financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a
    combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components,
    PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries  performed by TRICARE private sector
    contractors. The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken
    by DoD Components with additional collection activities performed by the Defense
    Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.
