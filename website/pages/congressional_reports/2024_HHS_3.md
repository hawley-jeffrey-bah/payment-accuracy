    Answer: 'The HHS Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is in Phase 2
      but is not reporting an improper payment and unknown payment estimate for the
      current reporting year.  Statutory limitations preclude HHS from collecting
      the required information needed to develop a Temporary Assistance for Needy
      Families improper payment measurement or corrective action plans.  Specifically,
      section 411 of the Social Security Act lists the exact data elements that HHS
      can collect from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families agencies.  Data on
      case and payment accuracy is not included under this section.  Further, Section
      417 of the Social Security Act, provides that HHS may only regulate the conduct
      of states where Congress has given ACF the express authority.  Until the current
      statutory language is amended to permit the development and administration of
      a national error rate, HHS is unable to provide the fiscal year that the program
      is expected to be able to report an estimate.
