SurveyData:
- Answer: 'The Department has determined that payment recapture audits would not be
    cost effective for any of its loan and grant programs or for contracts. The Department
    identifies and recovers improper payments through sources other than payment recapture
    audits and works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants to resolve
    and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and the Department
    conducted program reviews. The Department also analyzes the return of grant funds
    from recipients to determine if they are due to improper payments. When an improper
    payment is detected and deemed collectable, the Department establishes an account
    receivable and pursues collection. Recoveries are also made through grant program,
    payroll, and other offsets. Recipients of Department funds can appeal management’s
    decisions regarding funds to be returned to the Department or they may go bankrupt
    before the Department can collect, thereby delaying or decreasing the amounts
    the Department is able to collect.


    Additionally, the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect improper
    payments from grantees in cases where it determines that pursuing collections
    would cause more harm to the federal interest. For these and other reasons, not
    all identified improper payments will ultimately be collected and collections
    will not necessarily be made in the same year the improper payments were identified.'
