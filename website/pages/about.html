                <h2>Building Trust Through Transparency</h2>
                <p>Effective stewardship of taxpayer dollars means using data to make smarter decisions about where risks exists and how to address. PaymentAccuracy.gov helps by providing a clear picture of where Agencies are making progress and where challenges remain. By sharing improper payment information in one place, this site helps policymakers, oversight bodies, and the American taxpayer see how the Federal Government is working to improve outcomes and reduce waste over time.</p>
                <p>Improper payments come in many forms. Some result in real monetary loss, payments being made to the wrong entity or in the wrong amount. Other improper payments may be for the right amount to the right person, but are still considered improper due to technical errors such as missing documentation. While all improper payments matter, this platform emphasizes the need to distinguish between clerical issues and true high-risk breakdowns in controls resulting in wasted taxpayer dollars.</p>
